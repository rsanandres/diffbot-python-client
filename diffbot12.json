Kamala Harris, D-Calif; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; and potential independent candidate, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. But unlike those town halls, many participants who posed policy questions to Sanders appear to have political ties, which was first reported by <a href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/did-cnn-stack-the-audience-for-bernies-town-hall-l.html\">Paste Magazine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fox-news-dominates-msnbc-cnn-across-the-board-during-february\">FOX NEWS DOMINATES MSNBC, CNN ACROSS THE BOARD DURING FEBRUARY</a></strong></p>\n<p>Paste writer Jacob Weindling questioned whether CNN stacked the audience against the Democratic Socialist by not disclosing the background of some of the participants.</p>\n<p>Paste Magazine pointed out that at least four attendees have deep roots in the Democratic Party and the D.C. lobby, and alleged the way CNN described the participants either downplayed their background or did not disclose such ties at all.</p>\n<p>Tara Ebersole, who asked about Sanders&rsquo; plan for universal health care, was introduced by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer as a &ldquo;former biology professor,&rdquo; but her reported <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tara-ebersole-06117b10/\">LinkedIn</a> page claims her current job is chair of the Baltimore County Democratic Party.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lefties-turns-on-anti-trump-cnn-after-network-hires-ex-jeff-sessions-spokeswoman-sarah-isgur\">LEFTIES TURN ON ANTI-TRUMP CNN AFTER NETWORK HIRES EX-JEFF SESSIONS SPOKESWOMAN SARAH ISGUR</a></strong></p>\n<p>Yunjung Seo, who was described by CNN as a &ldquo;George Washington student,&rdquo; is currently an intern for the Democratic fundraising organization, the Katz Watson Group, and was previously a campaign fellow for Hillary Clinton for America according to her reported <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunjung-seo-957b51167/\">LinkedIn</a> page. Her question was about how Sanders plans on alleviating student debt.</p>\n<p>However, the arguably toughest question of the night was asked by Shadi Nasab, who was referred to as an &ldquo;American University student&rdquo; but is also an intern for the left-wing group Public Policy, according to her reported <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadinasab/\">LinkedIn</a> page.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As we saw in the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Party has become more female, more racially diverse, and younger in age. How can a voter like me feel confident in your ability to represent the party, especially given that your response to sexual harassment allegations during your campaign is that you were &lsquo;a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case to be elected as president,&rsquo;&quot; Nasab asked.</p>\n<p>Abena McAllister, who was described by Blitzer as &ldquo;active in Maryland Democrat Party,&rdquo; was listed by CNN&rsquo;s chyron as a &ldquo;mother of two.&rdquo; However, she is <a href=\"https://www.charlescountydems.org/about-ccdcc/current-committee-members/abena-mcallister-chair/\">apparently the chair</a> of the Charles County Democratic Central Committee.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-analyst-david-gergen-roger-stone-could-be-seen-as-a-dandy-in-jail-will-he-be-subject-to-rape\">CNN ANALYST DAVID GERGEN SAYS ROGER STONE COULD BE SEEN AS A &lsquo;DANDY&rsquo; IN JAIL: &lsquo;WILL HE BE SUBJECT TO RAPE?&rsquo;</a></strong></p>\n<p>Paste Magazine&rsquo;s Weindling thought the questions were &ldquo;completely normal&rdquo; until he did a little digging.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&quot;You cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN&rsquo;s role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace.&quot;</p>&mdash; Paste Magazine's Jacob Weindling</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Now that it has been revealed that the question was asked by an intern at a major lobbying firm, you cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN&rsquo;s role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace,&rdquo; Weindling wrote. &ldquo;If it was just this one questioner, we could chalk it up to a mistake, or an acknowledgement that CNN reasonably didn't believe that an intern needed to disclose her workplace. But this wasn't just one questioner. There were a bunch of audience members who are far more active in politics than CNN disclosed.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe data-v-02b2911f=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g9AiH_IsjDU\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/online/cnn-fails-to-disclose-democratic-party-ties-of-questioners-at-bernie-sanders-town-hall/\">Mediaite&rsquo;s</a> Caleb Ecarma pointed out why some prominent Democrats might not want Sanders to come off as favorable during the CNN event.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sanders has been harshly criticized by leading Democrats for supposedly trying to spoil the party&rsquo;s primary election, given his label as an independent and perception as an outsider,&rdquo; Ecarma wrote.</p>\n<p>The Young Turks &ndash; a progressive digital news organization &ndash; spent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=555&v=g9AiH_IsjDU\">significant time breaking down the situation</a>. Host Ana Kasparian said &ldquo;it appears that CNN did not disclose the true identities of the individuals asking the questions,&rdquo; calling the network&rsquo;s behavior &ldquo;unethical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Viewers should know who these individuals are,&rdquo; Kasparian said.</p>\n<p>Young Turks founder Cenk Uygur admitted he didn&rsquo;t know if the participants did not fully disclose their identity to CNN or if CNN purposely withheld information from viewers. But Uygur said there is an &ldquo;unfortunate history&rdquo; of CNN being unfair to &ldquo;one particular candidate,&rdquo; which he said is Sanders.</p>\n<p>During the 2016 election, the network took a lot of heat after it was discovered that Donna Brazile, who was a commentator at the time, leaked questions from a town hall event with the Clinton campaign.</p>",

                "text": "CNN admitted fault on Wednesday after being accused of failing to disclose Democratic Party ties of several attendees who were able to ask 2020 presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders questions during the network\u2019s town hall on Monday.\n\u201cThough we said at the beginning of the Town Hall that the audience was made up of Democrats and Independents, we should have more fully identified any political affiliations,\u201d a CNN spokesperson told Fox News.\nThe CNN event followed other recent town halls featuring Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn; and potential independent candidate, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. But unlike those town halls, many participants who posed policy questions to Sanders appear to have political ties, which was first reported by Paste Magazine.\nFOX NEWS DOMINATES MSNBC, CNN ACROSS THE BOARD DURING FEBRUARY\nPaste writer Jacob Weindling questioned whether CNN stacked the audience against the Democratic Socialist by not disclosing the background of some of the participants.\nPaste Magazine pointed out that at least four attendees have deep roots in the Democratic Party and the D.C. lobby, and alleged the way CNN described the participants either downplayed their background or did not disclose such ties at all.\nTara Ebersole, who asked about Sanders\u2019 plan for universal health care, was introduced by CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer as a \u201cformer biology professor,\u201d but her reported LinkedIn page claims her current job is chair of the Baltimore County Democratic Party.\nLEFTIES TURN ON ANTI-TRUMP CNN AFTER NETWORK HIRES EX-JEFF SESSIONS SPOKESWOMAN SARAH ISGUR\nYunjung Seo, who was described by CNN as a \u201cGeorge Washington student,\u201d is currently an intern for the Democratic fundraising organization, the Katz Watson Group, and was previously a campaign fellow for Hillary Clinton for America according to her reported LinkedIn page. Her question was about how Sanders plans on alleviating student debt.\nHowever, the arguably toughest question of the night was asked by Shadi Nasab, who was referred to as an \u201cAmerican University student\u201d but is also an intern for the left-wing group Public Policy, according to her reported LinkedIn page.\n\u201cAs we saw in the 2018 midterms, the Democratic Party has become more female, more racially diverse, and younger in age. How can a voter like me feel confident in your ability to represent the party, especially given that your response to sexual harassment allegations during your campaign is that you were \u2018a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case to be elected as president,\u2019\" Nasab asked.\nAbena McAllister, who was described by Blitzer as \u201cactive in Maryland Democrat Party,\u201d was listed by CNN\u2019s chyron as a \u201cmother of two.\u201d However, she is apparently the chair of the Charles County Democratic Central Committee.\nCNN ANALYST DAVID GERGEN SAYS ROGER STONE COULD BE SEEN AS A \u2018DANDY\u2019 IN JAIL: \u2018WILL HE BE SUBJECT TO RAPE?\u2019\nPaste Magazine\u2019s Weindling thought the questions were \u201ccompletely normal\u201d until he did a little digging.\n\"You cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN\u2019s role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace.\"\n\u2014 Paste Magazine's Jacob Weindling\n\u201cNow that it has been revealed that the question was asked by an intern at a major lobbying firm, you cannot help but wonder about the intent behind this, as well as CNN\u2019s role in selecting this questioner while not disclosing her workplace,\u201d Weindling wrote. \u201cIf it was just this one questioner, we could chalk it up to a mistake, or an acknowledgement that CNN reasonably didn't believe that an intern needed to disclose her workplace. But this wasn't just one questioner. There were a bunch of audience members who are far more active in politics than CNN disclosed.\u201d\nMediaite\u2019s Caleb Ecarma pointed out why some prominent Democrats might not want Sanders to come off as favorable during the CNN event.\n\u201cSanders has been harshly criticized by leading Democrats for supposedly trying to spoil the party\u2019s primary election, given his label as an independent and perception as an outsider,\u201d Ecarma wrote.\nThe Young Turks \u2013 a progressive digital news organization \u2013 spent significant time breaking down the situation. Host Ana Kasparian said \u201cit appears that CNN did not disclose the true identities of the individuals asking the questions,\u201d calling the network\u2019s behavior \u201cunethical.\u201d\n\u201cViewers should know who these individuals are,\u201d Kasparian said.\nYoung Turks founder Cenk Uygur admitted he didn\u2019t know if the participants did not fully disclose their identity to CNN or if CNN purposely withheld information from viewers. But Uygur said there is an \u201cunfortunate history\u201d of CNN being unfair to \u201cone particular candidate,\u201d which he said is Sanders.\nDuring the 2016 election, the network took a lot of heat after it was discovered that Donna Brazile, who was a commentator at the time, leaked questions from a town hall event with the Clinton campaign.",

Let's take a look back at some of her most bombastic anti-Trump moments of 2018.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view\">&ldquo;The View&rdquo;</a> was off last week when <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation\">Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s report </a>was released, so the show&rsquo;s liberal hosts wasted no time jumping into the fray when it returned Monday morning.</p>\n<p>Joy Behar, a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/the-view-star-joy-behars-anti-trump-statements-of-2018\">frequent and frenzied critic of President Trump</a>, got the ball rolling by stating Mueller missed out on what would have been a &ldquo;nail in the coffin&rdquo; for the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Can I say I was disappointed in the fact that Mueller didn&rsquo;t actually interview Trump?&rdquo; Behar asked her co-hosts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That would have been the nail in the coffin. He would have committed perjury and impeachment automatically. I was disappointed in that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Behar then blasted Mueller&rsquo;s reasoning for not subpoenaing the president for an interview as part of the investigation. The <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/read-the-robert-mueller-report\">report stated</a>: &ldquo;Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report. We determined that the substantial quality of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Behar wasn&rsquo;t buying the explanation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The answer he gave was it would take too much time and it would go into legal proceedings that would get convoluted,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p><u><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/the-view-star-joy-behars-anti-trump-statements-of-2018\">JOY BEHAR'S JOYLESS 2018: 'THE VIEW' STAR'S MOST OVER-THE-TOP ANTI-TRUMPINESS OF THE OF YEAR</a></strong></u></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I say, so what? They did it to Clinton. Why couldn't they do it to Trump? Because his lawyers impeded justice, in my opinion, by not allowing him to sit down, because they knew that he would commit perjury because he&rsquo;s a liar.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><picture><source media=\"(max-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/1470/828/ContentBroker_contentid-338fcfed900d406db93106bc2876347a.png?ve=1&tl=1 2x\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 767px)\" srcset=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/1862/1048/ContentBroker_contentid-338fcfed900d406db93106bc2876347a.png?ve=1&tl=1 2x\"></source><img alt=\"Whoopi Goldberg: \" src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/640/320/ContentBroker_contentid-338fcfed900d406db93106bc2876347a.png?ve=1&tl=1\"></img></picture><figcaption>Whoopi Goldberg: &quot;[I]f you try to get other people to break the law, that is a crime.

That should be a crime,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>After the co-hosts stated that is what they believe Trump did, she continued: &ldquo;Then he broke the law.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For me this is what's bothering me. The fact that we are now -- we have clear evidence of thing we need to change in what a president can and cannot do and how, those are the things -- for me that's the what the Mueller report gave me.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are the things that need to change.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "ABC News' 'The View' co-host Joy Behar has regained some cultural currency during the Trump administration with her constant commentary aimed at the president and members of his inner circle. Let's take a look back at some of her most bombastic anti-Trump moments of 2018.\n\u201cThe View\u201d was off last week when Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report was released, so the show\u2019s liberal hosts wasted no time jumping into the fray when it returned Monday morning.\nJoy Behar, a frequent and frenzied critic of President Trump, got the ball rolling by stating Mueller missed out on what would have been a \u201cnail in the coffin\u201d for the president.\n\u201cCan I say I was disappointed in the fact that Mueller didn\u2019t actually interview Trump?\u201d Behar asked her co-hosts.\n\u201cThat would have been the nail in the coffin. He would have committed perjury and impeachment automatically. I was disappointed in that.\u201d\nBehar then blasted Mueller\u2019s reasoning for not subpoenaing the president for an interview as part of the investigation. The report stated: \u201cRecognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report.\n\u201cWe thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report. We determined that the substantial quality of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.\u201d\nBut Behar wasn\u2019t buying the explanation.\n\u201cThe answer he gave was it would take too much time and it would go into legal proceedings that would get convoluted,\u201d she said.\nJOY BEHAR'S JOYLESS 2018: 'THE VIEW' STAR'S MOST OVER-THE-TOP ANTI-TRUMPINESS OF THE OF YEAR\n\u201cI say, so what? They did it to Clinton. Why couldn't they do it to Trump? Because his lawyers impeded justice, in my opinion, by not allowing him to sit down, because they knew that he would commit perjury because he\u2019s a liar.\u201d\nWhoopi Goldberg then joined in on the action, saying what \u201cp---ed her off\u201d about the report.\n\u201cWhat p---ed me off is that don't have anything in place that says, clearly enough to people so they don't do it, if you try to get other people to break the law, that is a crime. That should be a crime,\u201d she said.\nAfter the co-hosts stated that is what they believe Trump did, she continued: \u201cThen he broke the law.\n\u201cFor me this is what's bothering me. The fact that we are now -- we have clear evidence of thing we need to change in what a president can and cannot do and how, those are the things -- for me that's the what the Mueller report gave me.\n\u201cThese are the things that need to change.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren, D. Mass.</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris\">Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.</a>, both endorsed impeachment just this week.</p>\n<p>Harris stated she believes, &ldquo;Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,&rdquo; while Warren took her rhetoric a step further suggesting, &ldquo;If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-holds-urgent-conference-call-as-dems-scramble-to-fix-brewing-fracture-on-impeachment\"><strong>DEM LEADERS REJECT IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN URGENT CONFERENCE CALL</strong></a></p>\n<p>I, however, believe that it would be wrong for the Democrats to pursue impeachment for three fundamental reasons.</p>\n<p><strong>First, it is clear and obvious from the outset that the impeachment proceeding will fail.</strong> Not only is it no guarantee that impeachment would pass the marginally Democratically-controlled House of Representatives, but the Republicans continue to control the Senate and would assuredly defend the president of their own party by rejecting impeachment.</p>\n<p><strong>The second reason Democrats must not pursue impeachment is a simple example from recent history of the electoral consequences of attempting to impeach the sitting president. </strong>As an adviser to President Clinton between 1994 and 2000, I both observed and helped guide the president through many Republican-motivated partisan attacks on his executive leadership, especially impeachment proceedings of his own.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6028990417001\"><img alt=\"Democrats divided over calls to impeach President Trump\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/23/694940094001_6028989195001_6028990417001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>At the height of the partisan impeachment threats against President Clinton, as well as Republicans&rsquo; public attacks against the president during the Lewinsky scandal, our party managed a historic midterm elections victory in 1998, marking the first time in American history that a president gained seats in the House in the second term of his presidency.</p>\n<p>Put another way, voters rejected the impeachment proceedings, as well as the character assault against the president, and swung him an important electoral victory.</p>\n<p><strong>Third, and possibly the most important reason, Democrats must not pursue impeachment proceedings because they will distract from the essential job of leading and legislating.</strong></p>\n<p>If the Democrats are to be a success in 2020 and beyond, either by increasing their majority in the House, winning back Senate seats, or even winning back the presidency, they must advance an effective set of alternative policies to what the Republicans have both offered and enacted over nearly the past decade.</p>\n<p>A critically important place to start would be outlining an inclusive plan for economic growth. Despite public opposition to the Trump Tax Cuts of 2017, as well as clear uncertainty about the economic merits of the bill, the Democrats have failed to articulate a compelling alternative that puts lower-and middle-class Americans first. This must, of course, be done by advancing a new tax policy that will not only support these Americans in practice but one that actually has an opportunity to become law.</p>\n<p>Another important policy area where Democrats must direct their focus, instead of pursuing impeachment, is prescription drug pricing reform. The Democrats in the House majority would be better served by reaching across the aisle and working with Republicans to deliver for patients, especially seniors, rather than attempt to remove President Trump from office.</p>\n<p>By finding effective ways to lower the cost of prescription medication, such as requiring drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices, as well as increasing competition in the market to bring costs down without adding unnecessary regulation, the Democrats can continue to succeed on the issue of health care, which in many respects helped win them the House in 2018.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Democrats must pursue a compromise on immigration not only to take the issue off the table for President Trump and the Republicans but to do what is right for the millions of undocumented immigrants in our country striving for the American dream. The longer House Democrats push off the tough business of legislating and driving compromise on immigration, the longer these vulnerable communities will anguish.</p>\n<p>If the Democrats can formulate an effective plan to accomplish these priorities, their party, and more importantly the American people, will win in 2020 and beyond.</p>",

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., both endorsed impeachment just this week.\nHarris stated she believes, \u201cCongress should take the steps towards impeachment,\u201d while Warren took her rhetoric a step further suggesting, \u201cIf any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.\u201d\nDEM LEADERS REJECT IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN URGENT CONFERENCE CALL\nI, however, believe that it would be wrong for the Democrats to pursue impeachment for three fundamental reasons.\nFirst, it is clear and obvious from the outset that the impeachment proceeding will fail. Not only is it no guarantee that impeachment would pass the marginally Democratically-controlled House of Representatives, but the Republicans continue to control the Senate and would assuredly defend the president of their own party by rejecting impeachment.\nThe second reason Democrats must not pursue impeachment is a simple example from recent history of the electoral consequences of attempting to impeach the sitting president. As an adviser to President Clinton between 1994 and 2000, I both observed and helped guide the president through many Republican-motivated partisan attacks on his executive leadership, especially impeachment proceedings of his own.\nAt the height of the partisan impeachment threats against President Clinton, as well as Republicans\u2019 public attacks against the president during the Lewinsky scandal, our party managed a historic midterm elections victory in 1998, marking the first time in American history that a president gained seats in the House in the second term of his presidency.\nPut another way, voters rejected the impeachment proceedings, as well as the character assault against the president, and swung him an important electoral victory.\nThird, and possibly the most important reason, Democrats must not pursue impeachment proceedings because they will distract from the essential job of leading and legislating.\nIf the Democrats are to be a success in 2020 and beyond, either by increasing their majority in the House, winning back Senate seats, or even winning back the presidency, they must advance an effective set of alternative policies to what the Republicans have both offered and enacted over nearly the past decade.\nA critically important place to start would be outlining an inclusive plan for economic growth. Despite public opposition to the Trump Tax Cuts of 2017, as well as clear uncertainty about the economic merits of the bill, the Democrats have failed to articulate a compelling alternative that puts lower-and middle-class Americans first. This must, of course, be done by advancing a new tax policy that will not only support these Americans in practice but one that actually has an opportunity to become law.\nAnother important policy area where Democrats must direct their focus, instead of pursuing impeachment, is prescription drug pricing reform. The Democrats in the House majority would be better served by reaching across the aisle and working with Republicans to deliver for patients, especially seniors, rather than attempt to remove President Trump from office.\nBy finding effective ways to lower the cost of prescription medication, such as requiring drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices, as well as increasing competition in the market to bring costs down without adding unnecessary regulation, the Democrats can continue to succeed on the issue of health care, which in many respects helped win them the House in 2018.\nLastly, the Democrats must pursue a compromise on immigration not only to take the issue off the table for President Trump and the Republicans but to do what is right for the millions of undocumented immigrants in our country striving for the American dream. The longer House Democrats push off the tough business of legislating and driving compromise on immigration, the longer these vulnerable communities will anguish.\nIf the Democrats can formulate an effective plan to accomplish these priorities, their party, and more importantly the American people, will win in 2020 and beyond.",

And &ndash; as happens during the administration of every American president &ndash; our free press reports on many developments that the U.S. government would no doubt prefer to keep quiet.</p>\n<p>Simply reading and watching U.S. media reports gives the North Koreans great insights into our president and U.S. policies. Knowing so much puts Kim in a strong negotiating position.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-meets-with-vietnams-president-ahead-of-hanoi-summit-with-north-koreas-kim\">TRUMP MEETS WITH VIETNAM&rsquo;S PRESIDENT AHEAD OF HANOI SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA&rsquo;S KIM</a></strong></p>\n<p>In sharp contrast, far less public information is available about Kim &ndash; a dictator shrouded in mystery who exercises ironclad control over the North Korean media. North Korean media only report what Kim wants them to report. This puts President Trump at an information disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the president of the United States has an extraordinary source of information available that can tell him a great deal about Kim. The CIA&rsquo;s Directorate of Analysis produces carefully developed assessments of key foreign policy developments and foreign leaders.</p>\n<p>Having this information produced by the CIA &ndash; my former employer &ndash; enables President Trump to gain crucial insights into the thinking of Kim and have a greater understanding of what is going on in the North than what is provided by the news media.</p>\n<p>On any given day, CIA analysts could be examining such diverse issues as the disposition of Russian military forces, terrorists in South Asia, Iran&rsquo;s material support for proxy militants in the Middle East, violence in Venezuela, and the impact of tariffs on the Chinese economy.</p>\n<p>A key part of CIA analysis involves assessing foreign leaders. President Trump and other U.S. policymakers benefit by the CIA examining Kim&rsquo;s leadership style.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The North Korean dictator has carried out ruthless internal purges of his government&rsquo;s inner circle as well as executions of his own family members &ndash; including his half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in 2017.</p></blockquote>\n<p>What might CIA leadership analysts be writing about Kim Jong Un?</p>\n<p>The North Korean dictator has carried out ruthless internal purges of his government&rsquo;s inner circle as well as executions of his own family members &ndash; including his half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in 2017.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Kim Jong Un is a savvy operator who has demonstrated a high level of interpersonal skills when engaging with foreign leaders including President Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</p>\n<p>In 2013 Kim announced North Korea would simultaneously build its nuclear capability and develop its economy. Then in 2018 he shifted course and said North Korea would focus on economic development because it had met its nuclear weapons goals.</p>\n<p>Kim appears to be a rational actor who likely scripted these announcements to push his nuclear program to an advanced stage &ndash; even at the risk of incurring economic sanctions on his country &ndash; before swiveling to a policy of rapprochement designed to bring some sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>Kim has proven that he is a shrewd tactician capable of skillfully moving his pieces on the chessboard.</p>\n<p>At the height of international tensions following repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2017, Kim used the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea as an opening gambit towards d&eacute;tente with South Korea and the U.S.</p>\n<p>During the closing ceremonies for the Olympics, Kim&rsquo;s trusted former Chief of Intelligence Kim Yong Chol indicated North Korea&rsquo;s willingness to engage with the U.S.</p>\n<p>Like his grandfather Kim Il Sung, who ruled before him, Kim Jong Un also has a predilection for grand and ambitious policy initiatives.</p>\n<p>At the April Inter-Korean summit, Kim became the first North Korean leader to enter South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953. He conducted the first meeting by a North Korean leader with a sitting U.S president when he met with President Trump at the Singapore Summit in June.</p>\n<p>CIA leadership analysts undoubtedly have scoured all sources for information on Kim&rsquo;s early life and health, with an eye towards rounding out his psychological profile.</p>\n<p>As a child, Kim attended school in Switzerland. A shy student, he was known for being a basketball fan. Some reports have said that Kim, a heavy cigarette smoker who is significantly overweight, is a diabetic.</p>\n<p>Kim has an affinity for expensive alcohol and electronics. He built a new water park, an amusement park and a horseback riding club. Kim also built a sprawling luxury ski resort, complete with video screens playing government propaganda.</p>\n<p>How might a leadership profile inform a denuclearization negotiations strategy to deal with Kim?</p>\n<p>CIA leadership analysts undoubtedly have sought to determine with a low, medium or high level of confidence whether Kim might use his intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons arsenal as bargaining chips in return for food, energy assistance, and integration in the regional and world economy.</p>\n<p>His Singapore agreement to denuclearize notwithstanding, Kim might be more interested in enhancing his stature from a second summit with President Trump, gaining some modest relief from sanctions and winning international acceptance of North Korea&rsquo;s status as a nuclear state.</p>\n<p>President Trump is using the Vietnam summit to test whether Kim is ready to take serious steps toward denuclearization. These steps might include arms control agreements freezing North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile arsenals, as well as arms inspectors visiting weapons sites.</p>\n<p>Kim&rsquo;s motivations to negotiate might include his recognition that this is his last best chance to transform North Korea, an outlier in an economically vibrant region with a turbo-boosted economy.</p>\n<p>The North Korean leader will certainly seek assurances that his regime&rsquo;s security is not threatened before he takes serious steps to get rid of any of his nuclear weapons. Viewing the U.S. as an existential threat to North Korea, Kim is well aware of the lessons from Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi&rsquo;s 2011 overthrow, after Qaddafi had surrendered his nuclear weapons capability.</p>\n<p>Kim would like to see a negotiated end to the Korean War &ndash; which ended with an armistice in 1953 &ndash; because it would represent a grand diplomatic achievement and one his father and grandfather never accomplished.</p>\n<p>The North Korean leader could view a peace treaty as recognition of his regime&rsquo;s existence, giving him the confidence to take basic arms control steps like freezing nuclear tests and admitting inspectors into nuclear facilities he has claimed to have destroyed.</p>\n<p>President Trump has tamped down expectations for the Hanoi Summit by saying he is in no rush to achieve full North Korean denuclearization as long there is no further testing of nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>We can be sure President Trump and his team are probing Kim to determine whether denuclearization is in the realm of the possible. CIA leadership analysts will be eagerly awaiting the president&rsquo;s assessment of Kim&rsquo;s reactions.</p>\n<p>While no amount of information the CIA has provided about Kim can guarantee President Trump will succeed in his negotiations, the CIA leadership analysts' assessment undoubtedly is playing a key role in informing President Trump's strategy during these critically important talks.</p>\n<p>Daniel N.

                "text": "As President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un square off in their high-stakes negotiations in Hanoi this week, Kim has an important advantage: an enormous amount of information is publicly available about Trump and his positions on key issues.\nThe U.S. president draws intense media coverage, tweets frequently and speaks often to reporters. And \u2013 as happens during the administration of every American president \u2013 our free press reports on many developments that the U.S. government would no doubt prefer to keep quiet.\nSimply reading and watching U.S. media reports gives the North Koreans great insights into our president and U.S. policies. Knowing so much puts Kim in a strong negotiating position.\nTRUMP MEETS WITH VIETNAM\u2019S PRESIDENT AHEAD OF HANOI SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA\u2019S KIM\nIn sharp contrast, far less public information is available about Kim \u2013 a dictator shrouded in mystery who exercises ironclad control over the North Korean media. North Korean media only report what Kim wants them to report. This puts President Trump at an information disadvantage.\nFortunately, the president of the United States has an extraordinary source of information available that can tell him a great deal about Kim. The CIA\u2019s Directorate of Analysis produces carefully developed assessments of key foreign policy developments and foreign leaders.\nHaving this information produced by the CIA \u2013 my former employer \u2013 enables President Trump to gain crucial insights into the thinking of Kim and have a greater understanding of what is going on in the North than what is provided by the news media.\nOn any given day, CIA analysts could be examining such diverse issues as the disposition of Russian military forces, terrorists in South Asia, Iran\u2019s material support for proxy militants in the Middle East, violence in Venezuela, and the impact of tariffs on the Chinese economy.\nA key part of CIA analysis involves assessing foreign leaders. President Trump and other U.S. policymakers benefit by the CIA examining Kim\u2019s leadership style.\nThe North Korean dictator has carried out ruthless internal purges of his government\u2019s inner circle as well as executions of his own family members \u2013 including his half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in 2017.\nWhat might CIA leadership analysts be writing about Kim Jong Un?\nThe North Korean dictator has carried out ruthless internal purges of his government\u2019s inner circle as well as executions of his own family members \u2013 including his half-brother Kim Jong Nam in Malaysia in 2017.\nAt the same time, Kim Jong Un is a savvy operator who has demonstrated a high level of interpersonal skills when engaging with foreign leaders including President Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nIn 2013 Kim announced North Korea would simultaneously build its nuclear capability and develop its economy. Then in 2018 he shifted course and said North Korea would focus on economic development because it had met its nuclear weapons goals.\nKim appears to be a rational actor who likely scripted these announcements to push his nuclear program to an advanced stage \u2013 even at the risk of incurring economic sanctions on his country \u2013 before swiveling to a policy of rapprochement designed to bring some sanctions relief.\nKim has proven that he is a shrewd tactician capable of skillfully moving his pieces on the chessboard.\nAt the height of international tensions following repeated nuclear and ballistic missile tests in 2017, Kim used the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea as an opening gambit towards d\u00e9tente with South Korea and the U.S.\nDuring the closing ceremonies for the Olympics, Kim\u2019s trusted former Chief of Intelligence Kim Yong Chol indicated North Korea\u2019s willingness to engage with the U.S.\nLike his grandfather Kim Il Sung, who ruled before him, Kim Jong Un also has a predilection for grand and ambitious policy initiatives.\nAt the April Inter-Korean summit, Kim became the first North Korean leader to enter South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953. He conducted the first meeting by a North Korean leader with a sitting U.S president when he met with President Trump at the Singapore Summit in June.\nCIA leadership analysts undoubtedly have scoured all sources for information on Kim\u2019s early life and health, with an eye towards rounding out his psychological profile.\nAs a child, Kim attended school in Switzerland. A shy student, he was known for being a basketball fan. Some reports have said that Kim, a heavy cigarette smoker who is significantly overweight, is a diabetic.\nKim has an affinity for expensive alcohol and electronics. He built a new water park, an amusement park and a horseback riding club. Kim also built a sprawling luxury ski resort, complete with video screens playing government propaganda.\nHow might a leadership profile inform a denuclearization negotiations strategy to deal with Kim?\nCIA leadership analysts undoubtedly have sought to determine with a low, medium or high level of confidence whether Kim might use his intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons arsenal as bargaining chips in return for food, energy assistance, and integration in the regional and world economy.\nHis Singapore agreement to denuclearize notwithstanding, Kim might be more interested in enhancing his stature from a second summit with President Trump, gaining some modest relief from sanctions and winning international acceptance of North Korea\u2019s status as a nuclear state.\nPresident Trump is using the Vietnam summit to test whether Kim is ready to take serious steps toward denuclearization. These steps might include arms control agreements freezing North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile arsenals, as well as arms inspectors visiting weapons sites.\nKim\u2019s motivations to negotiate might include his recognition that this is his last best chance to transform North Korea, an outlier in an economically vibrant region with a turbo-boosted economy.\nThe North Korean leader will certainly seek assurances that his regime\u2019s security is not threatened before he takes serious steps to get rid of any of his nuclear weapons. Viewing the U.S. as an existential threat to North Korea, Kim is well aware of the lessons from Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi\u2019s 2011 overthrow, after Qaddafi had surrendered his nuclear weapons capability.\nKim would like to see a negotiated end to the Korean War \u2013 which ended with an armistice in 1953 \u2013 because it would represent a grand diplomatic achievement and one his father and grandfather never accomplished.\nThe North Korean leader could view a peace treaty as recognition of his regime\u2019s existence, giving him the confidence to take basic arms control steps like freezing nuclear tests and admitting inspectors into nuclear facilities he has claimed to have destroyed.\nPresident Trump has tamped down expectations for the Hanoi Summit by saying he is in no rush to achieve full North Korean denuclearization as long there is no further testing of nuclear weapons.\nWe can be sure President Trump and his team are probing Kim to determine whether denuclearization is in the realm of the possible. CIA leadership analysts will be eagerly awaiting the president\u2019s assessment of Kim\u2019s reactions.\nWhile no amount of information the CIA has provided about Kim can guarantee President Trump will succeed in his negotiations, the CIA leadership analysts' assessment undoubtedly is playing a key role in informing President Trump's strategy during these critically important talks.\nDaniel N.

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The American people &ndash; and just about all our elected officials &ndash; frequently and justifiably complain about the high cost of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care\">health care</a>. But unless Congress acts, a tax increase on medical devices will take effect Jan. 1 and needlessly raise those costs even higher.</p>\n<p>The 2.3 percent tax on medical devices was signed into law by President Obama and took effect in 2013. Fortunately, Congress passed legislation<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/medical-device-tax-repeal-comes-to-senate-supported-by-five-democrats\"> in 2015 and again in 2017</a> to temporarily suspend the tax. However, without further congressional action the tax will kick back in at the beginning of 2020.</p>\n<p>Because the tax is only 2.3 percent it may sound like an insignificant amount. It&rsquo;s not. Some medical devices are very expensive &ndash; for example, an MRI machine can cost up to $3 million. The 2.3 percent tax on that would amount to $69,000 &ndash; a cost that has to be ultimately paid by someone.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/medical-companies-brace-for-devastating-obamacare-tax-prepare-for-layoffs\">MEDICAL COMPANIES BRACE FOR 'DEVASTATING' OBAMACARE TAX, PREPARE FOR LAYOFFS</a></strong></p>\n<p>Fortunately, patients may get a reprieve. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. (a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination) recently introduced a bipartisan bill permanently repealing the tax on medical devices.</p>\n<p>Repealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all Americans. The repeal deserves support from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p>One reason you haven&rsquo;t heard more objections to this tax is that most Americans don&rsquo;t even know it exists.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Repealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all Americans.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Pacific Research Institute scholar Wayne Winegarden notes that the tax has been &ldquo;priced into the costs of the product&rdquo; and &ldquo;has been applied inconsistently across products due to exemptions and short-term suspensions, which create difficulties for firms to plan and manage the tax; and, subjects some medical devices to double taxation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Of course, repealing this tax is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what&rsquo;s needed to reform America&rsquo;s dysfunctional health care system. But piecemeal changes can resuscitate the push for wider reforms. Just because lawmakers can&rsquo;t agree on <em>everything </em>needed to improve our health care system doesn&rsquo;t mean they shouldn&rsquo;t agree on <em>anything</em>.</p>\n<p>Patients in need of health care would hardly be the only victims of a medical device tax. During the original implementation of the tax from 2013 to 2015, more than 20,000 industry jobs were lost as companies faced nearly $30 billion in lower sales.</p>\n<p>For medical device manufacturers big and small, stagnant sales led to less research into innovative products that can save lives. With fewer products sold, reduced access for patients and less innovation, new technologies were prevented from coming to market. Everyone suffered as a result.</p>\n<p>In addition, gray areas abound in the Internal Revenue Service&rsquo;s tax guidelines for the medical device tax, leading to uncertainty for the manufacturers of new cutting-edge products.</p>\n<p>For example, the recently-invented Dermaclip is an alternative to stitches that can heal wounds more quickly and less painfully than conventional sutures. The rise of such easier-to-apply &ldquo;skin closure devices&rdquo; may lead to consumers being able to purchase and use them on their own, complicating the IRS&rsquo;s exemption to the tax for any product &ldquo;generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By repealing the medical device tax, lawmakers can jumpstart health care innovation in the U.S. With a lighter touch from Uncle Sam, patients can see improved services at a lower price.</p>",

                "text": "The American people \u2013 and just about all our elected officials \u2013 frequently and justifiably complain about the high cost of health care. But unless Congress acts, a tax increase on medical devices will take effect Jan. 1 and needlessly raise those costs even higher.\nThe 2.3 percent tax on medical devices was signed into law by President Obama and took effect in 2013. Fortunately, Congress passed legislation in 2015 and again in 2017 to temporarily suspend the tax. However, without further congressional action the tax will kick back in at the beginning of 2020.\nBecause the tax is only 2.3 percent it may sound like an insignificant amount. It\u2019s not. Some medical devices are very expensive \u2013 for example, an MRI machine can cost up to $3 million. The 2.3 percent tax on that would amount to $69,000 \u2013 a cost that has to be ultimately paid by someone.\nMEDICAL COMPANIES BRACE FOR 'DEVASTATING' OBAMACARE TAX, PREPARE FOR LAYOFFS\nFortunately, patients may get a reprieve. Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. (a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination) recently introduced a bipartisan bill permanently repealing the tax on medical devices.\nRepealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all Americans. The repeal deserves support from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.\nOne reason you haven\u2019t heard more objections to this tax is that most Americans don\u2019t even know it exists.\nRepealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all Americans.\nPacific Research Institute scholar Wayne Winegarden notes that the tax has been \u201cpriced into the costs of the product\u201d and \u201chas been applied inconsistently across products due to exemptions and short-term suspensions, which create difficulties for firms to plan and manage the tax; and, subjects some medical devices to double taxation.\u201d\nOf course, repealing this tax is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what\u2019s needed to reform America\u2019s dysfunctional health care system. But piecemeal changes can resuscitate the push for wider reforms. Just because lawmakers can\u2019t agree on everything needed to improve our health care system doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t agree on anything.\nPatients in need of health care would hardly be the only victims of a medical device tax. During the original implementation of the tax from 2013 to 2015, more than 20,000 industry jobs were lost as companies faced nearly $30 billion in lower sales.\nFor medical device manufacturers big and small, stagnant sales led to less research into innovative products that can save lives. With fewer products sold, reduced access for patients and less innovation, new technologies were prevented from coming to market. Everyone suffered as a result.\nIn addition, gray areas abound in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s tax guidelines for the medical device tax, leading to uncertainty for the manufacturers of new cutting-edge products.\nFor example, the recently-invented Dermaclip is an alternative to stitches that can heal wounds more quickly and less painfully than conventional sutures. The rise of such easier-to-apply \u201cskin closure devices\u201d may lead to consumers being able to purchase and use them on their own, complicating the IRS\u2019s exemption to the tax for any product \u201cgenerally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use.\u201d\nBy repealing the medical device tax, lawmakers can jumpstart health care innovation in the U.S. With a lighter touch from Uncle Sam, patients can see improved services at a lower price.",

They're all connected to recent stories involving &quot;Generation E&quot; - the Entitlement Generation.</p>\n<p>We received a lot of emails last week after our coverage of the international student<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/planet-earth/climate\"> climate change</a> rallies, and many of you were wondering how these kids were permitted to just blow off school, shut down entire city streets, and inconvenience other students who actually want to do this thing called study.</p>\n<p>Well, the answer: Because the activists could.</p>\n<p>Was it easier hanging out with your friends and emoting about saving the planet and chanting really badly than studying, let's say, the Federalist papers or doing your physics lab? Well, come on, that's an easy answer, especially when schools excuse the absences, teachers themselves are encouraging the protests or the overwhelmingly left-wing and college admissions undoubtedly count activism as a legitimate extracurricular activity.</p>\n<p>And naturally, members of Generation E believe they should get into the best colleges, even if they do not have the best grades or the best course. And they develop, by the way, this warped view of their own self-importance because Mommy and Daddy raised them to believe that they were special, really special. Special in every extra special way.</p>\n<p>Come on, these are parents who hung their kids soccer participation medals on the bulletin board in the kitchen. They helped them write their term papers, they help them do their science projects. How else would an 8-year-old kid know how to design his own homework app. And as a <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/college-admissions-scandal\">college admissions fraud story</a> revealed, these are the types of parents who even commit crimes to guarantee their kids have doors open for them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-ingraham-angle/\"><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>\n<p>I think it's important to ask this: What's the end result here? Well, many of these young people -- and it's not just the wealthy kids -- grow up to be demanding entitled adults, and even ingrates. And at a time when American students are falling behind in science and math and reading, more and more kids at the same time here are indulged and even encouraged to become political activists before they've even earned their first paycheck.</p>\n<p>According to one assessment out of 71 countries, the U.S. was 38th place in math and 24th science. But forget about mastering things like math or science or life skills, such as manners or self-reliance, or speaking and writing ability. And why bother with all that, when society celebrates you for being a punk with a political point of view.</p>\n<p>Case in point: At the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, grad students are now demanding that the school remove ICE and border patrol job listings from their career services platform. Why? Because the university should not &quot;allow racist and abusive organization like this to recruit students.&quot;</p>\n<p>My friends, it's not just on American shores. Take this example from Australia. A 17-year old cracked an egg on the head of a right-wing politician. The politician stupidly took a swipe or swing at the kid and the video of the incident went viral. Well, that's when the praise from celebs starts coming in.</p>\n<p>Actor Armie Hammer said in an interview, &quot;I love that guy. I hope he inspires copycats. Everyone should be like Egg Boy. Everyone.&quot;</p>\n<p>Egg boy should get together with Pajama Boy. It'll be fun. All right, think about the Covington Catholic kid, Nick Sandmann. He just stood still and the elites like Armie Hammer and others accused that kid of being a racist and a provocateur.</p>\n<p>But in the Australia case, they take the kids side because the politician, he assaulted albeit with an egg, was himself far right. So if the target is someone not telling the social justice line, it's okay to assault him, even have copycats.</p>\n<p>And if it's gotten worse though than this because now, the activists are even feeding on their own. When Chelsea Clinton showed up at NYU to pay her respects after that horrific slaughter in New Zealand, a member of Generation E didn't thank her. She confronted her.</p>\n<p>Well, the young woman's shirt said it all: &quot;College for All.&quot; It never ends, right? Well, Generation E activists have their own set of demands - free college, free health care, a guaranteed standard of living and a free pass if they're living in the country illegally.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Activists are in our schools and they're aggressively propagandizing, Hollywood, and even churches, do as well and what they're selling is a political world view that numbs the young to socialism. That's the endgame. </p></blockquote>\n<p>And by the way, it's not just that. They also would require that you accept their views on everything from climate change to immigration to economic policy because they're entitled. And the old-timers like Nancy Pelosi are actually trying to co-op the energy of Generation E, -- the activist generation, the entitled generation -- by signing them up to vote early.</p>\n<p>Republicans should take heed of these trends and movements and offer a better alternative for the next generation. These are smart kids. Republicans must offer a future where they don't have to wait on the government to give them what they can earn for themselves and where they'll feel better about it -- and they'll feel better about themselves.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6015545938001\"><img alt=\"The Ingraham Angle \u2013 Monday, March 18\" src=\"https://secure.media.foxnews.com/BrightCove/990505083001/990505083001/2019/03/19/990505083001_6015542514001_6015549155001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>Activists, though, are in our schools and they're aggressively propagandizing, Hollywood, and even churches, do as well and what they're selling is a political world view that numbs the young to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/socialism\">socialism</a>.

                "text": "What do carbon, ice and an egg all have in common? They're all connected to recent stories involving \"Generation E\" - the Entitlement Generation.\nWe received a lot of emails last week after our coverage of the international student climate change rallies, and many of you were wondering how these kids were permitted to just blow off school, shut down entire city streets, and inconvenience other students who actually want to do this thing called study.\nWell, the answer: Because the activists could.\nWas it easier hanging out with your friends and emoting about saving the planet and chanting really badly than studying, let's say, the Federalist papers or doing your physics lab? Well, come on, that's an easy answer, especially when schools excuse the absences, teachers themselves are encouraging the protests or the overwhelmingly left-wing and college admissions undoubtedly count activism as a legitimate extracurricular activity.\nAnd naturally, members of Generation E believe they should get into the best colleges, even if they do not have the best grades or the best course. And they develop, by the way, this warped view of their own self-importance because Mommy and Daddy raised them to believe that they were special, really special. Special in every extra special way.\nCome on, these are parents who hung their kids soccer participation medals on the bulletin board in the kitchen. They helped them write their term papers, they help them do their science projects. How else would an 8-year-old kid know how to design his own homework app. And as a college admissions fraud story revealed, these are the types of parents who even commit crimes to guarantee their kids have doors open for them.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.\nI think it's important to ask this: What's the end result here? Well, many of these young people -- and it's not just the wealthy kids -- grow up to be demanding entitled adults, and even ingrates. And at a time when American students are falling behind in science and math and reading, more and more kids at the same time here are indulged and even encouraged to become political activists before they've even earned their first paycheck.\nAccording to one assessment out of 71 countries, the U.S. was 38th place in math and 24th science. But forget about mastering things like math or science or life skills, such as manners or self-reliance, or speaking and writing ability. And why bother with all that, when society celebrates you for being a punk with a political point of view.\nCase in point: At the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, grad students are now demanding that the school remove ICE and border patrol job listings from their career services platform. Why? Because the university should not \"allow racist and abusive organization like this to recruit students.\"\nMy friends, it's not just on American shores. Take this example from Australia. A 17-year old cracked an egg on the head of a right-wing politician. The politician stupidly took a swipe or swing at the kid and the video of the incident went viral. Well, that's when the praise from celebs starts coming in.\nActor Armie Hammer said in an interview, \"I love that guy. I hope he inspires copycats. Everyone should be like Egg Boy. Everyone.\"\nEgg boy should get together with Pajama Boy. It'll be fun. All right, think about the Covington Catholic kid, Nick Sandmann. He just stood still and the elites like Armie Hammer and others accused that kid of being a racist and a provocateur.\nBut in the Australia case, they take the kids side because the politician, he assaulted albeit with an egg, was himself far right. So if the target is someone not telling the social justice line, it's okay to assault him, even have copycats.\nAnd if it's gotten worse though than this because now, the activists are even feeding on their own. When Chelsea Clinton showed up at NYU to pay her respects after that horrific slaughter in New Zealand, a member of Generation E didn't thank her. She confronted her.\nWell, the young woman's shirt said it all: \"College for All.\" It never ends, right? Well, Generation E activists have their own set of demands - free college, free health care, a guaranteed standard of living and a free pass if they're living in the country illegally.\nActivists are in our schools and they're aggressively propagandizing, Hollywood, and even churches, do as well and what they're selling is a political world view that numbs the young to socialism. That's the endgame.\nAnd by the way, it's not just that. They also would require that you accept their views on everything from climate change to immigration to economic policy because they're entitled. And the old-timers like Nancy Pelosi are actually trying to co-op the energy of Generation E, -- the activist generation, the entitled generation -- by signing them up to vote early.\nRepublicans should take heed of these trends and movements and offer a better alternative for the next generation. These are smart kids. Republicans must offer a future where they don't have to wait on the government to give them what they can earn for themselves and where they'll feel better about it -- and they'll feel better about themselves.\nActivists, though, are in our schools and they're aggressively propagandizing, Hollywood, and even churches, do as well and what they're selling is a political world view that numbs the young to socialism. That's the endgame.\nIt's an exercise in wealth confiscation that will leave us less free, less prosperous and less tied to that age-old American value that hard work makes the man. Oh, well, though, if you feel offended that I just said \"man,\" then you are an honorary member of Generation E.\nYou're entitled to your opinion, but I'm not entitled or required to celebrate it.\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue from \"The Ingraham Angle\" on March 18, 2019.\nLaura Ingraham is the host of FOX News Channel\u2019s (FNC) The Ingraham Angle (weeknights 10PM/ET).

Sexist!</p>\n<p>The things he said about me were perhaps the ugliest and most repulsive things I have ever read.</p>\n<p>And I&rsquo;ve read A LOT of nasty things about myself.</p>\n<p>He kisses his daughter with that mouth, and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s also troubling.</p>\n<p>He posted an Instagram photo of me with a caption so vile and so horrific I can&rsquo;t share it with you.</p>\n<p>He then posted an unflattering photo of me from high school and joked how ugly I am, and how I had plastic surgery&hellip;which I didn&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Yeah, Game, I was about 16-years-old in that photo and yep, it&rsquo;s an ugly photo of me but STILL I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>\n<p>Wanna know why? Because guess where that photo was from? From an article in my local newspaper about getting a summer job.</p>\n<p>I have thick skin, really thick skin, but I am still a human being. I am someone&rsquo;s daughter, someone&rsquo;s granddaughter, someone&rsquo;s girlfriend, and a person.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to like me. You can even call me ugly, dumb, or a whole dictionary full of horrible things, but the collection of things that have been said or directed at me from The Game and friends, is not OK. And it&rsquo;s not just that it's not OK to say those things to me...It&rsquo;s not OK period.</p>\n<p>Look, I don&rsquo;t worry about me. I signed up for this.</p>\n<p>I think about all the young ladies who follow me and read this stuff and see this stuff.</p>\n<p>But this week Game took it a step further and defended his vile behavior on the day-time talk show, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://bossip.com/1712609/the-real-the-game-tomi-lahren/%C2%A0\">The Real</a>&rdquo;:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s never a woman thing. That post was about Tomi Lahren herself for her actions, and I wanted to post something that&rsquo;d be brash about it, and I hope that it made her day bad, and her co-workers looked at her crazy, and she had a terrible day.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wow.</p>\n<p>Not only is what he said about me disgusting, explicit and wrong -- I know girls see this stuff and think, I will never speak out like Tomi does and I will never be confident in my opinions because look what happens when you are -- you get treated like less than a human. And to attack my appearance when I was in high school, and now, really?</p>\n<p>Where are the feminists? Since when has that been OK? Just because I&rsquo;m Tomi?</p>\n<p>Girls struggle enough with personal confidence and self-esteem and when they see rappers with millions of followers attack someone&rsquo;s appearance -- what message does that send?</p>\n<p>Well, ladies, I hope you know that I will be OK.</p>\n<p>I will fight on.</p>\n<p>I will NOT be silenced or intimidated by the filth that is hurled at me by low-class rappers.</p>\n<p>And I know not all of you want this kind of public life, and I don&rsquo;t blame you.</p>\n<p>I just hope, in your own life, you are strong enough to block out hate like this.</p>\n<p>You will likely not experience it on the level I do, and I&rsquo;m glad.</p>\n<p>But you will experience it in some way, shape or form -- especially if you&rsquo;re a conservative and choose to be vocal and proud of it.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t back down and I don&rsquo;t stoop to their level because that&rsquo;s not how I was raised.</p>\n<p>I may make political points that offend people and I&rsquo;ll own that, but I would never even THINK half of the things that are said about me and to me.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t wish that kind of language on my worst enemy.</p>\n<p>These &ldquo;Final Thoughts&rdquo; are very personal and they mean a lot to me.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;d be easy to cower in the corner but playing dead has never really been my style.</p>\n<p>God bless and take care.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Join <a href=\"https://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=fn::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=content::add=opinion\">Fox Nation</a> today and watch the video. <a href=\"https://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=fn::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=content::add=opinion\">Fox Nation</a> is a subscription streaming service offering daily shows and documentaries that you can not watch anywhere else.

Sexist!\nThe things he said about me were perhaps the ugliest and most repulsive things I have ever read.\nAnd I\u2019ve read A LOT of nasty things about myself.\nHe kisses his daughter with that mouth, and that\u2019s what\u2019s also troubling.\nHe posted an Instagram photo of me with a caption so vile and so horrific I can\u2019t share it with you.\nHe then posted an unflattering photo of me from high school and joked how ugly I am, and how I had plastic surgery\u2026which I didn\u2019t.\nYeah, Game, I was about 16-years-old in that photo and yep, it\u2019s an ugly photo of me but STILL I\u2019m proud of it.\nWanna know why? Because guess where that photo was from? From an article in my local newspaper about getting a summer job.\nI have thick skin, really thick skin, but I am still a human being. I am someone\u2019s daughter, someone\u2019s granddaughter, someone\u2019s girlfriend, and a person.\nYou don\u2019t have to like me. You can even call me ugly, dumb, or a whole dictionary full of horrible things, but the collection of things that have been said or directed at me from The Game and friends, is not OK. And it\u2019s not just that it's not OK to say those things to me...It\u2019s not OK period.\nLook, I don\u2019t worry about me. I signed up for this.\nI think about all the young ladies who follow me and read this stuff and see this stuff.\nBut this week Game took it a step further and defended his vile behavior on the day-time talk show, \u201cThe Real\u201d:\n\u201cIt\u2019s never a woman thing. That post was about Tomi Lahren herself for her actions, and I wanted to post something that\u2019d be brash about it, and I hope that it made her day bad, and her co-workers looked at her crazy, and she had a terrible day.\"\nWow.\nNot only is what he said about me disgusting, explicit and wrong -- I know girls see this stuff and think, I will never speak out like Tomi does and I will never be confident in my opinions because look what happens when you are -- you get treated like less than a human. And to attack my appearance when I was in high school, and now, really?\nWhere are the feminists? Since when has that been OK? Just because I\u2019m Tomi?\nGirls struggle enough with personal confidence and self-esteem and when they see rappers with millions of followers attack someone\u2019s appearance -- what message does that send?\nWell, ladies, I hope you know that I will be OK.\nI will fight on.\nI will NOT be silenced or intimidated by the filth that is hurled at me by low-class rappers.\nAnd I know not all of you want this kind of public life, and I don\u2019t blame you.\nI just hope, in your own life, you are strong enough to block out hate like this.\nYou will likely not experience it on the level I do, and I\u2019m glad.\nBut you will experience it in some way, shape or form -- especially if you\u2019re a conservative and choose to be vocal and proud of it.\nI don\u2019t back down and I don\u2019t stoop to their level because that\u2019s not how I was raised.\nI may make political points that offend people and I\u2019ll own that, but I would never even THINK half of the things that are said about me and to me.\nI wouldn\u2019t wish that kind of language on my worst enemy.\nThese \u201cFinal Thoughts\u201d are very personal and they mean a lot to me.\nIt\u2019d be easy to cower in the corner but playing dead has never really been my style.\nGod bless and take care.\nJoin Fox Nation today and watch the video.

And that it was coming at the FBI and Justice Department through many different lanes or many different avenues, and the objective was to lend it credibility.\u201d\nHerridge added, \u201cMy recollection is there is a tie into the State Department, so we\u2019ll see exactly who Congressman Meadows is referring to \u2026 but that is where I think it\u2019s going.\u201d\nThe deposition was released last week due to a lawsuit over BuzzFeed and their publication of the much-debated Christopher Steele dossier.\nIt was also revealed that Steele used a now deactivated \u201cuser-generated\u201d website called \u201ciReport\u201d by CNN to gather much of the dossier information.\nMeadows appeared on \u201cHannity\u201d Monday, when he made the accusation that there was a \u201ccoordinated effort\u201d aimed at the president.\n\u201cIt's additional information that is coming out that will show not only was there no collusion, but there was a coordinated effort to take this president down. We talk about the 'Deep State.' There are players now, even ambassadors, that are sitting ambassadors that were involved in part of this with the FBI-DOJ,\u201d Meadows told Hannity",

Eric Swalwell calls on Attorney General William Barr to resign</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., argued the special counsel's report &quot;certainly&quot; showed evidence of collusion and rejected the idea that President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign deserved an apology for the controversial surveillance conducted under former President Barack Obama's administration.</p>\n<p>When Fox News host Julie Banderas asked Swalwell about a potential apology, the California congressman said that special counsel <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation\">Robert Mueller's report</a> &quot;laid out a multiplicity of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians.&quot;</p>\n<p>He contended that although special counsel Robert Mueller's report didn't declare collusion beyond a reasonable doubt, it still showed enough evidence of troubling contacts between Russia and Trump's associates. Swalwell argued that &quot;reasonable suspicion,&quot; a lower standard than &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt,&quot; was all that was necessary for starting an investigation.</p>\n<p>&quot;There was certainly evidence of collusion, not evidence that met the beyond a reasonable doubt standard&quot; he said on &quot;Outnumbered&quot; before affirming suspicions that Trump potentially knew about Russian activities related to the election. &quot;This president is in no way cleared,&quot; Swalwell said.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6028026810001\"><img alt=\"Tom Fitton: President Trump is the victim of a crime\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/19/694940094001_6028029839001_6028026810001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>Swalwell's appearance came amid growing pressure from Democrats for the Justice Department to reveal more information related to the investigation. The Trump administration, however, has declared &quot;Game Over,&quot; arguing that the report put collusion and obstruction concerns to rest.</p>\n<p>Kellyanne Conway, Trump's close adviser and 2016 campaign manager, indicated that the press owed her and the rest of the administration an apology. &quot;We&rsquo;re accepting apologies today, too, for anybody who feels the grace in offering them,&quot; she told reporters on Thursday.</p>\n<p>&quot;The big lie that you&rsquo;ve let fly for two years, it&rsquo;s over, folks,&quot; she also said in reference to collusion.</p>\n<p>Swalwell, who serves on both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, has acted as a key public figure in the Democratic push for further investigation. His interview indicated that Democrats would continue to pursue the issue despite speculation that it might be a poor political strategy going into 2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-adam-schiff-resignation-mueller\"><strong>KELLYANNE CONWAY REITERATES CALL FOR ADAM SCHIFF'S RESIGNATION AFTER MUELLER REPORT'S RELEASE</strong></a></p>\n<p>Swalwell told Banderas that he wasn't so much worried about the political consequences as he was about preserving American democracy.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's such an extraordinary remedy, we shouldn't even consider the political consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the consequence to our democracy &mdash; are we going to set a standard and say no president should do this or are we not?&quot;</p>\n<p>When asked whether Democrats should apologize, Swalwell seemed to decline the opportunity.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'll never apologize for loving our country so much that I don't think any campaign transition or president should draw as close to the Russians and welcome their support and never tell law enforcement while they were seeking to support them,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>&quot;I'll always stand on our side rather than Russia's, and I just wish the president would, too,&quot; he said.</p>",

Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., argued the special counsel's report \"certainly\" showed evidence of collusion and rejected the idea that President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign deserved an apology for the controversial surveillance conducted under former President Barack Obama's administration.\nWhen Fox News host Julie Banderas asked Swalwell about a potential apology, the California congressman said that special counsel Robert Mueller's report \"laid out a multiplicity of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians.\"\nHe contended that although special counsel Robert Mueller's report didn't declare collusion beyond a reasonable doubt, it still showed enough evidence of troubling contacts between Russia and Trump's associates. Swalwell argued that \"reasonable suspicion,\" a lower standard than \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" was all that was necessary for starting an investigation.\n\"There was certainly evidence of collusion, not evidence that met the beyond a reasonable doubt standard\" he said on \"Outnumbered\" before affirming suspicions that Trump potentially knew about Russian activities related to the election. \"This president is in no way cleared,\" Swalwell said.\nSwalwell's appearance came amid growing pressure from Democrats for the Justice Department to reveal more information related to the investigation. The Trump administration, however, has declared \"Game Over,\" arguing that the report put collusion and obstruction concerns to rest.\nKellyanne Conway, Trump's close adviser and 2016 campaign manager, indicated that the press owed her and the rest of the administration an apology. \"We\u2019re accepting apologies today, too, for anybody who feels the grace in offering them,\" she told reporters on Thursday.\n\"The big lie that you\u2019ve let fly for two years, it\u2019s over, folks,\" she also said in reference to collusion.\nSwalwell, who serves on both the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, has acted as a key public figure in the Democratic push for further investigation. His interview indicated that Democrats would continue to pursue the issue despite speculation that it might be a poor political strategy going into 2020.\nKELLYANNE CONWAY REITERATES CALL FOR ADAM SCHIFF'S RESIGNATION AFTER MUELLER REPORT'S RELEASE\nSwalwell told Banderas that he wasn't so much worried about the political consequences as he was about preserving American democracy.\n\"It's such an extraordinary remedy, we shouldn't even consider the political consequences,\" he said. \"It's the consequence to our democracy \u2014 are we going to set a standard and say no president should do this or are we not?\"\nWhen asked whether Democrats should apologize, Swalwell seemed to decline the opportunity.\n\"I'll never apologize for loving our country so much that I don't think any campaign transition or president should draw as close to the Russians and welcome their support and never tell law enforcement while they were seeking to support them,\" he said.\n\"I'll always stand on our side rather than Russia's, and I just wish the president would, too,\" he said.",

They're probably -- Joe Biden? And crazy Bernie [Sanders]? And mayor Pete [Buttigieg]? Three white guys, two of them are brontosauruses from 'Jurassic Park,' and that isn't going to sit well with the rest of this party, which has gone so far left,&quot; Limbaugh said on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-story\">&quot;The Story with Martha MacCallum.&quot;</a></p>\n<p>Limbaugh also said Biden may not be fully committed to running in 2020.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6029219149001\"><img alt=\"Ready, set, Joe?

These Democrats are all in the process of trying to out-leftist or out-liberal each other, and they're in a contest of who can give away the most,&quot; Limbaugh said.</p>\n<p>He continued, &quot;None of this is real, none of this can happen. This is disinformation, and it is really, I think it is an indication of just how little they think of their own voters, that their own voters don't even want to work. They don't even want to achieve. They don't even want to pursue excellence. They just want to have their hands out and vote for whoever is going to give them the most. What a way to ruin a life.&quot;</p>\n<p>Limbaugh took time to address Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, defending Trump and accusing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of colluding with the Russians.</p>\n<p>&quot;Hillary Clinton and her pals in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI, they are the ones who colluded with the Russians. They are the ones that gave us this entirely, totally bogus Steele dossier,&quot; Limbaugh said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Talk about irony, for Hillary Clinton to be talking about impeaching Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail -- and many of her co-conspirators in this whole sordid affair, which amounted to nothing more than a silent coup to overturn the election results in 2016.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, Nick Kalman and Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.</em></p>",

They're probably -- Joe Biden? And crazy Bernie [Sanders]? And mayor Pete [Buttigieg]? Three white guys, two of them are brontosauruses from 'Jurassic Park,' and that isn't going to sit well with the rest of this party, which has gone so far left,\" Limbaugh said on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum.\"\nLimbaugh also said Biden may not be fully committed to running in 2020.\n\"I don't think, Biden is putting off his announcement, I don't know how badly he really wants this, and you have to really want this if you are going to have any chance of winning it,\" Limbaugh said.\nFox News learned Tuesday that Biden's long-awaited 2020 presidential bid announcement has been pushed back from Wednesday to Thursday, with plans for the former vice president to follow up with an appearance in Pittsburgh next week.\nThe radio host also went after 2020 candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., criticizing her proposals including forgiving student loans.\n\"Pocahontas is not going to be the nominee. These Democrats are all in the process of trying to out-leftist or out-liberal each other, and they're in a contest of who can give away the most,\" Limbaugh said.\nHe continued, \"None of this is real, none of this can happen. This is disinformation, and it is really, I think it is an indication of just how little they think of their own voters, that their own voters don't even want to work. They don't even want to achieve. They don't even want to pursue excellence. They just want to have their hands out and vote for whoever is going to give them the most. What a way to ruin a life.\"\nLimbaugh took time to address Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, defending Trump and accusing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of colluding with the Russians.\n\"Hillary Clinton and her pals in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI, they are the ones who colluded with the Russians. They are the ones that gave us this entirely, totally bogus Steele dossier,\" Limbaugh said.\n\"Talk about irony, for Hillary Clinton to be talking about impeaching Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail -- and many of her co-conspirators in this whole sordid affair, which amounted to nothing more than a silent coup to overturn the election results in 2016.\"\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser, Nick Kalman and Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.",

We are media titans, but we are not in politics. It is the party of Donald Trump right now, and the Republicans that don't realize that had better get on board,&quot; Limbaugh said, reacting to a New York Times op-ed by Joe Lockhart, a press secretary to then-President Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>&quot;Republicans today are the party of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson &mdash; a coalition that, in the face of every demographic trend in America, will mean the long-term realignment of the federal government behind the Democrats,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/opinion/theres-a-bigger-prize-than-impeachment.html\">Lockhart wrote Monday</a>.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/6028115046001\"><img alt=\"Top Democrats reject efforts to remove Trump from office\" src=\"https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/04/19/694940094001_6028113112001_6028115046001-vs.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>Limbaugh said Lockhart's words were an example of frustration within the Democrats.</p>\n<p>&quot;They haven't been able to 'defeat me' in 30 years. They can't defeat Trump. They haven't been able to stop him, and I think they are frustrated. They have thrown every weapon they have in their arsenal at Donald Trump, and nothing's worked. Things they've used over the years that have been readily available to get rid and take out any Republican they want, they have bounced off of Trump,&quot; Limbaugh told Martha MacCallum.</p>\n<p>Limbaugh criticized the Republican party for not fully standing behind Trump and celebrating his &quot;victory&quot; when the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report was released. He also noted that Trump wasn't just taking on the Democratis but was battling the Washington establishment -- including Republicans.</p>\n<p>&quot;Where's the Republican party with the celebratory emails to their voters? Even fund-raising, or just celebrating the victory, where are they? You don't hear them. The reason is, Martha, because this is a battle not between two parties, this is a battle between the Washington establishment and the deep state, I call them the administrative state, and outsiders and Americans who feel disenfranchised or unattached,&quot; Limbaugh said.</p>\n<p>Limbaugh also went after <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/after-mueller-report-journalists-issue-mea-culpas-on-romneys-russia-prediction\">Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah</a>, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/romney-says-mueller-report-left-him-sickened-at-the-extent-and-pervasiveness-of-dishonesty-and-misdirection\">for saying he was &quot;sickened&quot; by the president's actions as documented in the Mueller report</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is no reason not to get behind him unless you don't like his voters, and that is where I think the key to understanding this is,&quot; Limbaugh said.</p>\n<p><i>Fox News' Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.</i></p>",

                "text": "Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh didn't mince words while addressing multiple issues Tuesday on \"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" but his strongest hits were aimed at Republicans who had yet to fully jump on the President Trump bandwagon.\n\"Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, we are not in politics. We are media titans, but we are not in politics. It is the party of Donald Trump right now, and the Republicans that don't realize that had better get on board,\" Limbaugh said, reacting to a New York Times op-ed by Joe Lockhart, a press secretary to then-President Bill Clinton.\n\"Republicans today are the party of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson \u2014 a coalition that, in the face of every demographic trend in America, will mean the long-term realignment of the federal government behind the Democrats,\" Lockhart wrote Monday.\nLimbaugh said Lockhart's words were an example of frustration within the Democrats.\n\"They haven't been able to 'defeat me' in 30 years. They can't defeat Trump. They haven't been able to stop him, and I think they are frustrated. They have thrown every weapon they have in their arsenal at Donald Trump, and nothing's worked. Things they've used over the years that have been readily available to get rid and take out any Republican they want, they have bounced off of Trump,\" Limbaugh told Martha MacCallum.\nLimbaugh criticized the Republican party for not fully standing behind Trump and celebrating his \"victory\" when the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report was released. He also noted that Trump wasn't just taking on the Democratis but was battling the Washington establishment -- including Republicans.\n\"Where's the Republican party with the celebratory emails to their voters? Even fund-raising, or just celebrating the victory, where are they? You don't hear them. The reason is, Martha, because this is a battle not between two parties, this is a battle between the Washington establishment and the deep state, I call them the administrative state, and outsiders and Americans who feel disenfranchised or unattached,\" Limbaugh said.\nLimbaugh also went after Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, for saying he was \"sickened\" by the president's actions as documented in the Mueller report.\n\"There is no reason not to get behind him unless you don't like his voters, and that is where I think the key to understanding this is,\" Limbaugh said.\nFox News' Martha MacCallum contributed to this report.",

Trump once again framing the 2020 debate in terms of socialism versus capitalism. This is an argument that Bolsonaro can understand as well as Trump.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "The strong bond between President Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro can be traced to the values they share, Washington Free Beacon editor-in-chief Matthew Continetti said Tuesday.\nEarlier in the day, Trump offered a warm welcome to Bolsonaro in a White House meeting that not only heavily focused on the self-destruction of Venezuela but also on Trump floating the idea of Brazil joining NATO.\nDuring Tuesday's \"Special Report\" All-Star panel, Continetti -- along with Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York and Cook Political Report national editor Amy Walter -- weighed on Trump\u2019s alliance with Bolsonaro and their joint news conference.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL SHOW\nYork began by pointing out that Trump many have \u201cadlibbed\u201d about Brazil\u2019s inclusion into NATO since his national security advisor John Bolton dismissed the idea ours after the press conference, but expressed hope that their alliance can still make an impact in Venezuela.\nWalter told the panel that Bolsonaro is one of the very few world leaders where Trump sees \u201ceye-to-eye\u201d regarding how government works and \u201cfake news\u201d and it shows that Trump \u201chas allies around the world who are willing to stand side-by-side with him.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Continetti insisted that both Trump and Bolsonaro have \u201cone of the most important relationships\u201d in the world.\n\u201cThey both represent a new model of leadership for democracies and that is they\u2019re both nationalists, they\u2019re both anti-elitists, they\u2019re both socially conservative and you can tell by Bolsonaro\u2019s rhetoric that his voters are very similar to many of Trump\u2019s voters and what they care about and what they believe, and they\u2019re also capitalists,\u201d Continetti told the panel. \u201cSo socialism became an issue in this press conference as well. Trump once again framing the 2020 debate in terms of socialism versus capitalism. This is an argument that Bolsonaro can understand as well as Trump.\u201d",

The college forces them to move around the country, especially to smaller states whose handful of electoral votes could tip the balance.</p>\n<p>I have mixed feelings about the Electoral College, which has been debated seemingly forever. It does seem like a relic of the 18th century. It has a musty, anti-democratic smell around it.</p>\n<p>But the old rules help the winner by exaggerating their margin of victory. And it avoids the nightmare of a national recount in a contested election, a calamity that would make people nostalgic for Florida's hanging chads.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-calls-to-revamp-electoral-college-supreme-court-reveal-panic-lara-trump\"><strong>DEMOCRATS' CALLS TO REVAMP ELECTORAL COLLEGE, SUPREME COURT REVEAL PANIC: LARA TRUMP</strong></a></p>\n<p>Still, Warren's newfound passion for dumping the Electoral College is driven by Democratic primary politics. Without that part of the Constitution, Al Gore would have won the presidency in 2000 and Hillary Clinton would have been victorious in 2016.</p>\n<p>Democrats feel the college is keeping them from having a lock on the White House, so it's a new kind of red meat. Why else would a candidate like Warren get excited over a constitutional amendment that would take years to pass?</p>\n<p>Colorado just became the 12th state to sign a compact giving its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, even if that candidate loses Colorado. The deal would take effect once states with 270 electoral votes sign on, but right now it's at 181.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/in-defense-of-the-electoral-college-the-national-popular-vote-interstate-compact-is-a-big-mistake\"><strong>OPINION: IN DEFENSE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE -- THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE COMPACT IS A BIG MISTAKE</strong></a></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Warren has been joined by Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand in pushing to expand the Supreme Court. The three 2020 contenders told Politico they support the idea, which Warren said would be about &quot;depoliticizing&quot; the high court.</p>\n<p>But their motivation isn't hard to divine. First, Democrats openly complain, with much justification, that they were unfairly denied a Senate vote on Merrick Garland's nomination in 2016.</p>\n<p>Second, President Trump has already named 91 federal judges, with the prospect of many more to come.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/some-2020-democrats-want-dramatic-increase-of-supreme-court-justices\"><strong>2020 DEMOCRATS EYE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: 'ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE'</strong></a></p>\n<p>But this is all too reminiscent of FDR's court-packing scheme, which was a political failure. Some Democrats want 15 justices on the court. They obviously see this as a way to correct the fact that the court now has a clear conservative majority &mdash; a point that Trump addressed yesterday at a news conference in predicting it would never happen.</p>\n<p>&quot;The only reason they're doing that is they're trying to catch up,&quot; Trump said. &quot;So if they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election they want to try doing it in a different way.&quot;</p>\n<p>To have even a prayer of pushing this through, the Democrats would have to win not only the White House but a big Senate majority in 2020.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the Democratic candidates embracing these ideas are trying to sell blatantly partisan moves as process reforms.</p>\n<p>These are the kind of abstract political debates that, while important, are unlikely to motivate voters as much as climate change or health care. But what Warren and company are counting on is that they could excite the kind of activists who turn out in Democratic primaries.</p>",

                "text": "\"Every vote matters,\" the U.S. senator from Massachusetts told CNN, \"and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.\"\nShe argued that presidential nominees no longer campaign in places like California and Massachusetts because they\u2019re not swing states, instead focusing on battlegrounds that are up for grabs.\nThat's true, but if you abolished the college tomorrow, candidates would camp out in such megastates as New York, California, Florida, and Texas in an effort to run up their popular vote totals. The college forces them to move around the country, especially to smaller states whose handful of electoral votes could tip the balance.\nI have mixed feelings about the Electoral College, which has been debated seemingly forever. It does seem like a relic of the 18th century. It has a musty, anti-democratic smell around it.\nBut the old rules help the winner by exaggerating their margin of victory. And it avoids the nightmare of a national recount in a contested election, a calamity that would make people nostalgic for Florida's hanging chads.\nDEMOCRATS' CALLS TO REVAMP ELECTORAL COLLEGE, SUPREME COURT REVEAL PANIC: LARA TRUMP\nStill, Warren's newfound passion for dumping the Electoral College is driven by Democratic primary politics. Without that part of the Constitution, Al Gore would have won the presidency in 2000 and Hillary Clinton would have been victorious in 2016.\nDemocrats feel the college is keeping them from having a lock on the White House, so it's a new kind of red meat. Why else would a candidate like Warren get excited over a constitutional amendment that would take years to pass?\nColorado just became the 12th state to sign a compact giving its electoral votes to the national popular vote winner, even if that candidate loses Colorado. The deal would take effect once states with 270 electoral votes sign on, but right now it's at 181.\nOPINION: IN DEFENSE OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE -- THE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE INTERSTATE COMPACT IS A BIG MISTAKE\nMeanwhile, Warren has been joined by Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand in pushing to expand the Supreme Court. The three 2020 contenders told Politico they support the idea, which Warren said would be about \"depoliticizing\" the high court.\nBut their motivation isn't hard to divine. First, Democrats openly complain, with much justification, that they were unfairly denied a Senate vote on Merrick Garland's nomination in 2016.\nSecond, President Trump has already named 91 federal judges, with the prospect of many more to come.\n2020 DEMOCRATS EYE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES: 'ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE'\nBut this is all too reminiscent of FDR's court-packing scheme, which was a political failure. Some Democrats want 15 justices on the court. They obviously see this as a way to correct the fact that the court now has a clear conservative majority \u2014 a point that Trump addressed yesterday at a news conference in predicting it would never happen.\n\"The only reason they're doing that is they're trying to catch up,\" Trump said. \"So if they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election they want to try doing it in a different way.\"\nTo have even a prayer of pushing this through, the Democrats would have to win not only the White House but a big Senate majority in 2020.\nIn both cases, the Democratic candidates embracing these ideas are trying to sell blatantly partisan moves as process reforms.\nThese are the kind of abstract political debates that, while important, are unlikely to motivate voters as much as climate change or health care. But what Warren and company are counting on is that they could excite the kind of activists who turn out in Democratic primaries.",

She returned to the U.S. after the 2011 ruling that freed her but was sentenced in absentia to prison again in 2014 &mdash; until Italy&rsquo;s highest court overturned that decision in March 2015, ending the possibility of future trials.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4470510083001\"><img alt=\"Italy's highest court clears Amanda Knox\" src=\"https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/09/08/640/360/090815_ff_knox_640.jpg\"></img></a></figure>\n<p>In late January, the European Human Rights Court ordered the country to <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/europe-court-orders-italy-to-pay-amanda-knox-20g-in-damages\">pay Knox $20,000 in damages</a> for not providing the American proper legal aid and a translator during her lengthy questioning.</p>\n<p>&quot;Ms. Knox had been particularly vulnerable, being a foreign young woman, 20 at the time, not having been in Italy for very long and not being fluent in Italian,&quot; the court noted.</p>\n<p>After the ruling, Knox's defense attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, argued it was &quot;probably the biggest legal mistake&quot; Italy has seen in years.</p>\n<p>&quot;It is impossible to compensate Amanda for four years in prison for a mistake. There will be no amount. We are not looking for compensation of damages. We are doing this on principle,&quot; Dalla Vedova said, adding it was one of the most highly publicized murder trials in the world's history.</p>\n<p>After her acquittal, Knox began working as a freelance journalist and worked closely with the <a href=\"https://www.innocenceproject.org/\">Innocence Project</a>, a non-profit legal aid organization that helps exonerate wrongly convicted inmates.

Her friends, also expressionless, are next to her.\nWhile some applauded Knox's \"priceless\" and \"creative\" joke, others slammed it as distasteful.\n\"You have no shame,\" one Instagram user wrote, in part.\n\"Anything for attention,\" a user echoed.\n\"Murder, your favourite subject!\" a third added.\nOne woman, on the other hand, exclaimed she was \"living for this caption.\" And another praised the \"shade\" and voiced her \"love\" for Knox.\nKnox's conviction in the death of her British roommate while living abroad in Italy was overturned on appeal in October 2011. She returned to the U.S. after the 2011 ruling that freed her but was sentenced in absentia to prison again in 2014 \u2014 until Italy\u2019s highest court overturned that decision in March 2015, ending the possibility of future trials.\nIn late January, the European Human Rights Court ordered the country to pay Knox $20,000 in damages for not providing the American proper legal aid and a translator during her lengthy questioning.\n\"Ms. Knox had been particularly vulnerable, being a foreign young woman, 20 at the time, not having been in Italy for very long and not being fluent in Italian,\" the court noted.\nAfter the ruling, Knox's defense attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, argued it was \"probably the biggest legal mistake\" Italy has seen in years.\n\"It is impossible to compensate Amanda for four years in prison for a mistake. There will be no amount. We are not looking for compensation of damages. We are doing this on principle,\" Dalla Vedova said, adding it was one of the most highly publicized murder trials in the world's history.\nAfter her acquittal, Knox began working as a freelance journalist and worked closely with the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal aid organization that helps exonerate wrongly convicted inmates. Knox says working closely with the group has \"changed [her] life.\"\n\"This group was built by [lawyers], scientists and intellectuals who are trying to prove facts and understand how things get blown out of proportion. They are emotionally and intellectually there for me. They understand that we already had to pay for our lives with the things we didn\u2019t do,\" Knox told Rolling Stone in 2017, later adding that it was \"crazy\" she had to prove her innocence \"in the first place.\"\nAn Ivorian immigrant, Rudy Guede, is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder.\nFox News' Katherine Lam and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

But Macomb County Judge Richard Caretti said he could not \"in good conscience\" abide by that agreement, and subsequently handed Gerth the tougher sentence.\nWARNING: DISTURBING DETAILS BELOW\n\"In my almost 17 years on the bench your case is by far the worst, most deplorable example of animal cruelty I've ever seen,\" Caretti told Gerth, according to Fox station WJBK. \"Words are inadequate to express the depth and breadth of your cruelty.\"\n(Macomb County Sheriff\u2019s Office)\nThe judge continued, \"Statistics show [famous] killers ... started down their path to infamy by abusing and killing animals. Let's hope my sentence discourages you from such behavior. ... But in your case [with the old animal cruelty sentencing legislation] - it may not be enough.\"\nAround 40 animal lovers in the courtroom burst into applause at the sentence on Tuesday.\nThe 23-year-old told the judge that \"looking back I realize there were better ways of handling this situation.\"\n\"Respectfully, I want people to know and understand that I did not do this with some kind of sick, twisted, premeditated motive, as which was said before,\" he continued. \"If I could go back and do this differently I would.\"\nWhen Gerth first applied to adopt Sterling from the Michigan Humane Society, he was denied because of his living situation, WJBK reported. He convinced his former roommate to try to adopt Sterling, who then moved into Gerth's apartment.\nThe former roommate told investigators that Gerth once bragged to him about how badly he beat the dog to the point it urinated and defecated \"all over the place.\"\nThe Michigan Humane Society said in a statement in court that Gerth's actions were \"senseless, calculated and malicious\" and \"did not affect just one person or one animal. His brutal actions impact our community, and the animal welfare community as a whole.\"\nMacomb County Prosecutor Eric Smith said in a news release that Gerth had a criminal record prior to the death of Sterling, which included a bank robbery in Illinois.",

Warren, who is gay and was in the process of becoming ordained, called the vote &quot;incredibly painful.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Traditional Plan's success was due to an alliance of conservatives from the U.S. and overseas. About 43 percent of the delegates were from abroad, mostly from <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/africa\">Africa</a>, and the overseas delegates overwhelmingly supported the LGBT bans.

                "text": "(AP Photo/Sid Hastings)\nThe second-largest Protestant denomination in the country is facing the prospect of mass defections and acts of defiance after delegates at a conference in St. Louis voted Tuesday to strengthen the United Methodist Church's bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBTQ clergy.\nAfter three days of intense discussions at the General Conference Special Session, 56 percent of the 800 delegates in attendance voted in favor of a proposal by conservatives called Traditional Plan, which upholds the church's stance prohibiting LGBTQ members from being ordained and does not permit same-sex couples to be married.\n\"It's obviously crushing,\" delegate J.J. Warren from New York told FOX2. Warren, who is gay and was in the process of becoming ordained, called the vote \"incredibly painful.\"\nThe Traditional Plan's success was due to an alliance of conservatives from the U.S. and overseas. About 43 percent of the delegates were from abroad, mostly from Africa, and the overseas delegates overwhelmingly supported the LGBT bans. Membership in the church has been growing in locations such as Africa and Asia.\n(AP Photo/Sid Hastings)\nIf the bans were eased, \"the church in Africa would cease to exist,\" said the Rev. Jerry Kulah of Liberia. \"We can't do anything but to support the Traditional Plan \u2014 it is the biblical plan.\"\nThe deep split within the church was evident in several fiery speeches opposing the Traditional Plan.\n\"If we bring this virus into our church, it will bring illness to us all,\" said the Rev. Thomas Berlin of Herndon, Virginia. He predicted many Methodist churchgoers and some regional bodies would leave the church, while others would \"stay and fight,\" performing same-sex weddings even if it meant punishment.\nCouncil of Bishops President Kenneth H. Carter, speaking at a news conference after the session, said the meeting in St. Louis was necessary \"because if the impasse we found ourselves in\" over questions of human sexuality.\n\"I would just simply say that we have work to do. We did not accomplish that in these three days,\" Carter said. He added he was concerned the plan will cause progressive churches to leave the denomination.\n\"Persons will feel harmed,\" he said.\nFormed in a merger in 1968, the United Methodist Church claims about 12.6 million members worldwide, including nearly 7 million in the United States. High-profile church members include former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former first lady Laura Bush. After the vote was complete, dozens of people filled the lobby outside the convention hall at the Dome at America's Center to sing, pray and support one another, FOX2 reported.\nILLINOIS BILL WILL MAKE STATE THE 'ABORTION CAPITAL OF AMERICA,' PRO-LIFE GROUP WARNS\nWhile other mainline Protestant denominations, such as the Episcopal and Presbyterian (U.S.A.) churches, have embraced gay-friendly practices, the Methodist church still bans them, though acts of defiance by pro-LGBTQ clergy have increased. Many have performed same-sex weddings; others have come out as gay or lesbian from the pulpit of their churches. Enforcement of the bans has been inconsistent, but that could change under the Traditional Plan.\n(AP Photo/Sid Hastings)\nThe Rev. Tim Bagwell, 64, pastor at a UMC church in Macon, Georgia, had opposed the Traditional Plan and called the outcome \"deeply painful.\" But he said his church will stay with UMC until at least 2020, when the next major conference is scheduled. He's hopeful new delegates will be elected and change course to a more inclusive church.\n\"I am deeply sad,\" he told the Associated Press. \"The Methodist church has always been mainstream, reaching out to people. This sends a different tone...one of exclusion, not inclusion.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
