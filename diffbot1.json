Andrew Miller, former aide to Roger Stone, seen here in this undated profile picture. Obtained by ABC News</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Miller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Mueller's federal grand jury, which has been met with heavy legal resistance. In late June, Miller turned over requested documents to prosecutors, but he was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in the Russia probe.</p>\n<p>The three judge panel found that Mueller was properly appointed in the spring of 2017 by the then-deputy attorney general of the United States, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump\">Rod Rosenstein</a>, after the attorney general at the time <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/trump-administration\">Jeff Sessions</a>, recused himself from the Russia investigation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, and the Deputy Attorney General became the head of the Department by virtue of becoming the Acting Attorney General as a result of a vacancy created by the disability of the Attorney General through recusal on the matter, we hold that Miller&rsquo;s challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails. Accordingly, we affirm the order finding Miller in civil contempt,&rdquo; D.C. Circuit Court Judges Karen Henderson, Sri Srinivasan and Judith Rogers wrote in an opinion Tuesday.</p>\n<p>In upholding the contempt order, the three-judge panel ordered Miller to testify before Mueller's grand jury.</p>\n<p>After oral arguments last November, Miller's attorney Paul Kamenar told ABC News, &quot;Even if we lose this [appeals] case we will certainly bring it to the Supreme Court.&quot;</p>\n<p>Kamenar&rsquo;s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller&rsquo;s appointment was not handled properly. He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a &ldquo;U.S. Attorney at large,&rdquo; and as such, should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate &ndash; neither of which occurred.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/roger-stone-ap-jef-190222_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Roger Stone, former adviser and long time associate of President Trump, arrives at the E.

On Feb. 1, he pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>",

                "text": "A federal appeals court rejected the most direct constitutional challenge to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s authority on Tuesday, telling a former associate of Roger Stone he must testify before Mueller because the special counsel was \"properly appointed\" to his role overseeing the independent investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nThe appeal was launched on behalf of Andrew Miller, a former associate of Stone, a political provocateur, and steered by the National Legal and Policy Center, a well-funded conservative legal group with a deep history of mounting legal challenges against left-leaning organizations and Democratic politicians.\nMiller is fighting a special counsel subpoena compelling him to appear before Mueller's federal grand jury, which has been met with heavy legal resistance. In late June, Miller turned over requested documents to prosecutors, but he was also subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury in the Russia probe.\nThe three judge panel found that Mueller was properly appointed in the spring of 2017 by the then-deputy attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, after the attorney general at the time Jeff Sessions, recused himself from the Russia investigation.\n\u201cBecause the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, and the Deputy Attorney General became the head of the Department by virtue of becoming the Acting Attorney General as a result of a vacancy created by the disability of the Attorney General through recusal on the matter, we hold that Miller\u2019s challenge to the appointment of the Special Counsel fails. Accordingly, we affirm the order finding Miller in civil contempt,\u201d D.C. Circuit Court Judges Karen Henderson, Sri Srinivasan and Judith Rogers wrote in an opinion Tuesday.\nIn upholding the contempt order, the three-judge panel ordered Miller to testify before Mueller's grand jury.\nAfter oral arguments last November, Miller's attorney Paul Kamenar told ABC News, \"Even if we lose this [appeals] case we will certainly bring it to the Supreme Court.\"\nKamenar\u2019s challenge to the legitimacy of the special counsel probe is based on a claim that Mueller\u2019s appointment was not handled properly. He argues Mueller has been effectively operating as a \u201cU.S. Attorney at large,\u201d and as such, should have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate \u2013 neither of which occurred.\nIn a statement to ABC News following the judges\u2019 decision to uphold the contempt order against Miller, Kamenar wrote, \"We are disappointed with the decision and will be considering future legal action, whether before the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court.\u201d\nKamenar added, \u201cThe fact that the court took over three months to decide this appeal after oral argument compared to the three days it took in December to decide another challenge to a Mueller subpoena issued to an unnamed foreign corporation, demonstrates that this was a serious and substantial challenge.\u201d\nReached by ABC News on Tuesday, special counsel spokesperson Peter Carr declined to comment.\nMiller, 34, paints houses for a living now but served as an aide to Stone until 2013.\nStone, who was a longtime informal political adviser to President Donald Trump, once described Miller as his \u201cwingman\u201d because he helped manage Stone\u2019s schedule, travel and media appearances, and also provided \u201csome I.T. work.\u201d Miller identifies himself as a libertarian and has said he did not support Trump\u2019s candidacy, but he did accompany Stone to the 2016 Republican National Convention.\nOn Jan. 25th, Stone was arrested in a pre-dawn FBI raid at his home in Florida and charged with a seven-count indictment in Mueller's probe. On Feb. 1, he pleaded not guilty to the charges.",

                "text": "As part of the Trump administration's effort to slow migrants from crossing the southern border, Attorney General William Barr has ordered that some of those claiming asylum should be denied bail, meaning they could be stuck behind bars for years, rather than days.\nUnder previous policy, those who seek asylum were granted a bail hearing if they claimed \"credible fear\" threats or threats of persecution in their home country while waiting for their cases to be heard.\nImmigration advocates expressed shock at Barr's action and promised to challenge it immediately in court. The decision, which doesn't go into effect for 90 days, orders immigration judges to deny some asylum seekers from posting bail.\nBarr's instruction to immigration judges, whom the attorney general oversees and are not part of the judicial branch, comes out of a case involving an Indian man who was picked up \"50 miles\" away from the southern border in Mexico and claimed asylum. Barr says in similar cases bail can be withheld.\n\"The question here is whether, under [immigration law], aliens transferred after establishing a credible fear are eligible for release on bond,\" he continued.\n\"I reverse the order granting bond to the respondent,\" Barr wrote in his decision, stating that unless the Department of Homeland Security grants parole under a special exception, under the applicable legal provisions \"he must be detained until his removal proceedings conclude.\"\nAccording to Barr's opinion, the person seeking asylum could ask for bond, but it is entirely up to DHS. The order doesn't affect unaccompanied minors along the southern border, ether.\n\"There is no way to apply those provisions except as they were written\u2014unless paroled, an alien must be detained until his asylum claim is adjudicated,\" Barr wrote.\nIn Washington state earlier month, a federal judge agreed with the policy that those with \"bona fide\" asylum claims to have a bail hearing within seven days to determine if they can be released on bond while they wait for their court proceedings.\nThe adjudication of asylum claims could take months or years - given the backlog of cases and lack of immigration judges. In its latest budget request, the Justice Department has requested funds to hire more judges.\nThe ACLU said it will sue.\n\"This is the Trump administration\u2019s latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States. Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process. We'll see the administration in court,\" Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project, said in a statement.\nPresident Donald Trump has pushed to end the policy of \"catch and release.\"\n\"Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away,\" the president tweeted in November 2018.\nThis is just the latest step that the Trump administration has taken to combat what Trump calls a crisis on the southern border.\nIn May 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions enacted a zero-tolerance policy which lead to the separation of families along the border.\nSessions at the time, said that the policy was a \"deterrent\" for those who attempt to cross the southern border.\nThe president ended the policy months later in the face of widespread criticism.",

In a statement ahead of the visit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the two leaders will discuss &quot;opportunities for defense cooperation, pro-growth trade policies, combating transnational crime and restoring democracy in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/venezuela\">Venezuela</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>A senior administration official, who requested anonymity, told reporters Bolsonaro's visit represented a &quot;real opportunity to fundamentally remake our relationship with Brazil.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The U.S.-Brazil relationship has always been one of potential, but yet that potential has not always been met,&quot; the senior administration official said. &quot;This time it is different. This is a historic remaking of the U.S.-Brazil relationship where there is truly going to be a North-South axis of the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere and a true partnership of the largest economies.&quot;</p>\n<p>At the start of their White House meetings, the president said he is considering NATO membership or some kind of similar alliance for Brazil.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are looking at it very strongly. We are very inclined to do that. The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better. I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents.

Trump threatened tougher sanctions on Venezuela and said &quot;all options are on the table.&quot; Maduro would not divulge any new strategies in the region, but said establishing a true democracy in the country was a shared priority.</p>\n<p>The leaders on Tuesday also discussed a Brazilian offer to grant the United States access to a rocket launch site, the removal of a Visa requirement for Americans traveling to Brazil, and trade.</p>\n<p>If Bolsonaro's goal was to strengthen the relationship between Brazil and the United States, it appeared he was successful at least in gaining the friendship of Trump, who gave him a warm welcome in the Rose Garden. Bolsonaro even got a chuckle out of the president for saying he believed he would get re-elected.</p>\n<p>&quot;Well, it's an internal affair. We will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020, but I do believe Donald Trump is going to be re-elected fully,&quot; Bolsonaro said when asked about the 2020 elections.</p>\n<p>&quot;Thank you.

He was unabashedly, particularly in Brazil, pro America,&quot; a senior administration official said of Bolsonaro. &quot;He ran on a campaign that he wanted to be the best friend of the United States that he wanted to have this close relationship with President Trump, and what that would mean for Brazil, for the region, for the world, I think that was very important.&quot;</p>\n<p>The official said the president took note of Bolsonaro's Trump-like rhetoric and social media presence, and called Bolsonaro to congratulate him within hours of his election.</p>\n<p>U.S. officials hope the visit will not only boost their economic relationship but align efforts to <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/maduro-accuses-us-government-fabricating-crisis-start-war/story?id=61215212\">provide humanitarian assistance</a> to Venezuela.</p>\n<p>Brazil shares a border with Venezuela and, like the United States, has joined with dozens of other world leaders in pressuring socialist Nicholas Maduro to turn over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido. But while Trump has said &quot;every option is on the table&quot; in Venezuela, suggesting the use of military force, Brazil has pushed for diplomatic talks to lead to a change in power.</p>\n<p>A senior administration official said Brazil plays an important role as an &quot;interlocutor&quot; between the U.S. and Venezuela.</p>\n<p>&quot;Brazil has allowed the United States to preposition humanitarian aid for Venezuela on Brazil's northern border and we are very grateful to that and we thank him for working tirelessly to provide aide to the Brazilian people and them opening their doors,&quot; the official said. &quot;There's also an opportunity here where they can be very good interlocutors. The Brazilian Military has very good relationships with the Venezuelan military and clearly communicate with them as to what should be the role with the Venezuelan military in regards to civility and not repressing and not maintaining the usurpation of democracy Maduro seeks.&quot;</p>\n<p>The U.S. and Brazil hope to end the meetings with signed agreements, including an agreement that would allow the U.S. to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil.</p>\n<p>&quot;You will see -- after the visit tomorrow, we will plan to announce a joint statement that will have a lot of deliverables, some which are currently, frankly, right now being signed and being finalized and being negotiated. And that's all extraordinarily positive,&quot; an official said Monday. &quot;We think that we have, really, a historic opportunity to re-frame hemispheric relations with this North-South axis.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "President Donald Trump and \"the Trump of the Tropics,\" Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, met face to face at the White House on Tuesday.\nBolsonaro -- a nationalist, Twitter-loving, \"fake-news\" decrying politician -- chose to make the first bilateral trip of his presidency to Washington, where he has found an important friend and ally in Trump.\nAs part of a three-day visit in Washington, Bolsonaro held a press conference with Trump as he aims to strengthen economic ties and positioning with the U.S. as Brazil seeks an allied front in the Western Hemisphere. In a statement ahead of the visit, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the two leaders will discuss \"opportunities for defense cooperation, pro-growth trade policies, combating transnational crime and restoring democracy in Venezuela.\"\nA senior administration official, who requested anonymity, told reporters Bolsonaro's visit represented a \"real opportunity to fundamentally remake our relationship with Brazil.\"\n\"The U.S.-Brazil relationship has always been one of potential, but yet that potential has not always been met,\" the senior administration official said. \"This time it is different. This is a historic remaking of the U.S.-Brazil relationship where there is truly going to be a North-South axis of the two largest economies in the Western Hemisphere and a true partnership of the largest economies.\"\nAt the start of their White House meetings, the president said he is considering NATO membership or some kind of similar alliance for Brazil.\n\u201cWe are looking at it very strongly. We are very inclined to do that. The relationship that we have right now with Brazil has never been better. I think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents. There is zero hostility with me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we are going to look at that very strongly in terms of whether it is NATO or something having to do with alliance.\u201d\nIn the Rose Garden press conference, the two leaders said they were able to discuss their goals in Venezuela. Trump threatened tougher sanctions on Venezuela and said \"all options are on the table.\" Maduro would not divulge any new strategies in the region, but said establishing a true democracy in the country was a shared priority.\nThe leaders on Tuesday also discussed a Brazilian offer to grant the United States access to a rocket launch site, the removal of a Visa requirement for Americans traveling to Brazil, and trade.\nIf Bolsonaro's goal was to strengthen the relationship between Brazil and the United States, it appeared he was successful at least in gaining the friendship of Trump, who gave him a warm welcome in the Rose Garden. Bolsonaro even got a chuckle out of the president for saying he believed he would get re-elected.\n\"Well, it's an internal affair. We will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020, but I do believe Donald Trump is going to be re-elected fully,\" Bolsonaro said when asked about the 2020 elections.\n\"Thank you. I agree,\" Trump said with a smile.\nTrump said he liked to hear Bolsonaro use the term \"fake news.\"\nIn his opening statement, Bolsonaro said that Brazil and the United States \"stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties in respect to traditional family lifestyles, respect to god, our creator, politically correct attitudes, and against fake news.\"\nTrump said he was \"proud\" to hear his new Brazilian buddy use the same term.\nBolsonaro, who was accompanied on his trip to the United States by his son, lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, visited CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Monday and addressed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Brazil is the second-largest economy in the Western Hemisphere, and the United States is Brazil's second-largest trading partner after China.\n\"For the first time in a while, a pro-America Brazilian president arrives in D.C.,\" Bolsonaro tweeted upon arriving in Washington. \"It's the beginning of a partnership focused on liberty and prosperity, something that all of us Brazilians have long wished for.\"\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro is a right-wing populist with a penchant for rocking the status quo and using Twitter to blast his message around the globe. Bolsonaro has been accused of making racist and homophobic remarks and recently has come under fire for a sexually explicit tweet during Brazil\u2019s Carnival festival.\nTrump was one of the first world leaders to call and congratulate Bolsonaro after this landslide victory in October. Similar to Trump's election, Bolsonaro's win stunned the world and was part a wave of nationalist, right-wing leaders elected in Latin America.\n\"His election, he broke all of the historic taboos of winning an election in Latin America. He was unabashedly, particularly in Brazil, pro America,\" a senior administration official said of Bolsonaro. \"He ran on a campaign that he wanted to be the best friend of the United States that he wanted to have this close relationship with President Trump, and what that would mean for Brazil, for the region, for the world, I think that was very important.\"\nThe official said the president took note of Bolsonaro's Trump-like rhetoric and social media presence, and called Bolsonaro to congratulate him within hours of his election.\nU.S. officials hope the visit will not only boost their economic relationship but align efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to Venezuela.\nBrazil shares a border with Venezuela and, like the United States, has joined with dozens of other world leaders in pressuring socialist Nicholas Maduro to turn over power to opposition leader Juan Guaido. But while Trump has said \"every option is on the table\" in Venezuela, suggesting the use of military force, Brazil has pushed for diplomatic talks to lead to a change in power.\nA senior administration official said Brazil plays an important role as an \"interlocutor\" between the U.S. and Venezuela.\n\"Brazil has allowed the United States to preposition humanitarian aid for Venezuela on Brazil's northern border and we are very grateful to that and we thank him for working tirelessly to provide aide to the Brazilian people and them opening their doors,\" the official said. \"There's also an opportunity here where they can be very good interlocutors. The Brazilian Military has very good relationships with the Venezuelan military and clearly communicate with them as to what should be the role with the Venezuelan military in regards to civility and not repressing and not maintaining the usurpation of democracy Maduro seeks.\"\nThe U.S. and Brazil hope to end the meetings with signed agreements, including an agreement that would allow the U.S. to launch satellites and rockets into space from Brazil.\n\"You will see -- after the visit tomorrow, we will plan to announce a joint statement that will have a lot of deliverables, some which are currently, frankly, right now being signed and being finalized and being negotiated. And that's all extraordinarily positive,\" an official said Monday. \"We think that we have, really, a historic opportunity to re-frame hemispheric relations with this North-South axis.\"",

Elizabeth Warren wants to get rid of the Electoral College</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2020-candidate-elizabeth-warren-unveils-plan-break-big/story?id=61555895\">U.S Senator </a><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, who is competing for the Democratic nomination for president, said this week that she supports &ldquo;getting rid of <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/electoral-college-mondays-vote/story?id=44265972\">the electoral college</a>,&rdquo; and having the presidency decided by a national popular vote.</p>\n<p>She was quickly attacked by many who think this is a &ldquo;radical idea.&rdquo; Let us pause for a moment and examine that hypothesis.</p>\n<p>First, in polling over the last few years, a large majority of voters support deciding the presidency by popular vote as opposed to the Electoral College. Support for the popular vote has risen as Americans have witnessed, in the last 20 years, two presidents win the Oval Office while losing the national popular vote. The difference in 2016 was greatest -- Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Second, the argument that the Electoral College ensures that candidates travel to smaller states as well as large ones isn&rsquo;t true, and is no longer happening. In the 2020 <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elections\">election</a>s, campaigns and candidates from both major parties are expected to concentrate nearly all their time and efforts in only 5 or 6 states, which represent less than 20 percent of people who will vote for president. Therefore, 44 or 45 states, large and small, will be virtually ignored in the process as it is now.</p>\n<p>If the 2020 election were to be decided by a national popular vote instead of the Electoral College, candidates and campaigns in the general election would have to completely refashion their strategies.</p>\n<p>In all likelihood, they would have to run a national campaign with national advertising buys where all Americans would be involved in the debate over who the next president should be.

Already, a number of states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which a state&rsquo;s electoral votes would be assigned to whoever won the national popular vote.

This would need to be combined with efforts to fix gerrymandering and expanding their number of members in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Today, each House member represents on average about 750,000 people which has become both unwieldy and less responsive to constituents. Keep in mind, in 1789 after the first apportionment, 105 House members each represented roughly 37,000 people, <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/31/u-s-population-keeps-growing-but-house-of-representatives-is-same-size-as-in-taft-era/\">according to the Pew Research Center</a>. The number of representatives has increased after nearly every census apportionment until it reached 435 members in 1913, when the average district size was at approximately 200,000 people. A law was passed in 1911 limiting the size of the House to 435 members, and it has remained for more than 100 years. Our founders foresaw a rise in House members as America grew in population, and Congress could pass a law to expand the House to a more representative number.</p>\n<p>So while abolishing the Electoral College as Warren suggests may be near impossible, her statement that a president should be elected by national popular vote is not radical, it is actually mainstream.</p>\n<p>We can get closer to the national popular vote having greater weight in presidential elections and having a president represent all Americans in ways that don&rsquo;t require amending the Constitution. These fixes will make presidential candidates run more diverse campaigns, and campaign in all cities and communities of our country.</p>\n<p>That will help unify us more as a country, and would likely lead to more informed public policy. How can anyone be against that outcome?</p>",

                "text": "U.S Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is competing for the Democratic nomination for president, said this week that she supports \u201cgetting rid of the electoral college,\u201d and having the presidency decided by a national popular vote.\nShe was quickly attacked by many who think this is a \u201cradical idea.\u201d Let us pause for a moment and examine that hypothesis.\nFirst, in polling over the last few years, a large majority of voters support deciding the presidency by popular vote as opposed to the Electoral College. Support for the popular vote has risen as Americans have witnessed, in the last 20 years, two presidents win the Oval Office while losing the national popular vote. The difference in 2016 was greatest -- Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but lost the Electoral College to Donald Trump.\nSecond, the argument that the Electoral College ensures that candidates travel to smaller states as well as large ones isn\u2019t true, and is no longer happening. In the 2020 elections, campaigns and candidates from both major parties are expected to concentrate nearly all their time and efforts in only 5 or 6 states, which represent less than 20 percent of people who will vote for president. Therefore, 44 or 45 states, large and small, will be virtually ignored in the process as it is now.\nIf the 2020 election were to be decided by a national popular vote instead of the Electoral College, candidates and campaigns in the general election would have to completely refashion their strategies.\nIn all likelihood, they would have to run a national campaign with national advertising buys where all Americans would be involved in the debate over who the next president should be. To reallocate resources, the campaigns would have to put time and effort into at least 40 states, representing 90 percent of the country\u2019s voters.\nIn a national popular vote effort, campaigns would have to spend time in places like Texas, California, New York, Louisiana, Washington, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, George, North Carolina, etc. Under the current system, candidates only go to those states to fundraise.\nA popular vote effort would have to appeal to voters in urban, suburban, ex-urban, and rural communities of America. And campaigns would have to concentrate on both turning out their bases, as well as persuading swing voters.\nIf you are someone who is an independent and wants choices in the presidential race other than Democrat or Republican, ending the Electoral College removes a major impediment for an independent presidential candidacy. It is much easier for an independent to win the popular vote than it is for that candidate to win the Electoral College.\nThird, while passing a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College is highly unlikely -- the bar of three-fourths of states passing an amendment in this polarized environment is almost impossible -- there are constitutional ways to make the presidential election more representative of the nation as a whole, involving more voters from more areas. Already, a number of states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which a state\u2019s electoral votes would be assigned to whoever won the national popular vote. Though they are not yet at the required number of states necessary to total 270 electoral votes, there is a path to get their politically in the years ahead.\nAnother way to make the popular vote matter, while retaining the Electoral College, is to adopt the Maine and Nebraska model. Those states assign electoral votes by a combination of two statewide and one for each congressional district in their states. A presidential candidate wins one electoral vote for every house district they win. This would need to be combined with efforts to fix gerrymandering and expanding their number of members in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nToday, each House member represents on average about 750,000 people which has become both unwieldy and less responsive to constituents. Keep in mind, in 1789 after the first apportionment, 105 House members each represented roughly 37,000 people, according to the Pew Research Center.

These fixes will make presidential candidates run more diverse campaigns, and campaign in all cities and communities of our country.\nThat will help unify us more as a country, and would likely lead to more informed public policy. How can anyone be against that outcome?",

The company said it removed the option for landlords, employers and creditors to reach people with an &quot;affinity for African-American or Hispanic-related content&quot; about a year ago.</p>\n<p>Under the new rules, a company looking to run housing, employment or credit ads also won&rsquo;t be able to target Facebook members based on age, gender or zip code. And, Facebook said it was also building a tool that would let people search for all housing ads in the U.S. regardless of whether the ads are shown.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Housing, employment and credit ads are crucial to helping people buy new homes, start great careers, and gain access to credit,&rdquo; Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in the company&rsquo;s online post. &ldquo;They should never be used to exclude or harm people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A joint statement by the advocacy groups, including the National Fair Housing Alliance, said in a statement that the agreement represented a &quot;significant and historic precedent for big data and tech companies&quot; because it makes clear the information they collect can't be used to discriminate.</p>\n<p>&quot;Companies must understand that depending on how data is being used, it can harm people and communities,&quot; said Fred Freiberg, director of the Fair Housing Justice Center of New York. &quot;This agreement will help other companies that rely on algorithms and data for a range of services and operations to carefully consider whether their policies, products, and platforms are illegally discriminating against consumers.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "Facebook announced Tuesday that it will block landlords and creditors from using a person's demographic data including a person\u2019s zip code, gender and age, to target certain groups in online advertisements.\nThe announcement is part of a legal settlement with groups that promote fair housing laws. They complained in court last year that the social media giant enabled real estate brokers and landlords to exclude certain demographics when advertising.\nThe federal government, under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, had filed its own complaint against Facebook for violating the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits businesses from which prohibits the sale or rental of housing based on such factors as race or religion.\nThe company also was accused of allowing employers to discriminate against women by targeting job listings toward men only, specifically in traditionally male-dominated fields.\nThe complaints followed a 2016 report by ProPublica that found Facebook allowed advertisers to exclude anyone with an \u201caffinity\u201d for African-American, Asian-American or Hispanic people.\nThe 1968 Fair Housing Act of 1968 says its illegal \"to make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.\u201d\nFacebook said in a blog post Tuesday by Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, that it already prohibited certain categories from being used in advertising such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion. The company said it removed the option for landlords, employers and creditors to reach people with an \"affinity for African-American or Hispanic-related content\" about a year ago.\nUnder the new rules, a company looking to run housing, employment or credit ads also won\u2019t be able to target Facebook members based on age, gender or zip code. And, Facebook said it was also building a tool that would let people search for all housing ads in the U.S. regardless of whether the ads are shown.\n\u201cHousing, employment and credit ads are crucial to helping people buy new homes, start great careers, and gain access to credit,\u201d Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote in the company\u2019s online post. \u201cThey should never be used to exclude or harm people.\u201d\nA joint statement by the advocacy groups, including the National Fair Housing Alliance, said in a statement that the agreement represented a \"significant and historic precedent for big data and tech companies\" because it makes clear the information they collect can't be used to discriminate.\n\"Companies must understand that depending on how data is being used, it can harm people and communities,\" said Fred Freiberg, director of the Fair Housing Justice Center of New York. \"This agreement will help other companies that rely on algorithms and data for a range of services and operations to carefully consider whether their policies, products, and platforms are illegally discriminating against consumers.\"",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke:</p>\n<h3>What they're earning</h3>\n<p>One of the most apparent takeaways from a candidates' tax documents is how much they're making each year.</p>\n<p>All the candidates reported making more than $200,000, filed jointly with their spouses, in adjusted gross income in 2018, putting them <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2018/comm/acs-5yr-income-all-counties.html\">substantially above</a> an average American's earnings, ranging from <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kamala-harris-latest-2020-dem-contender-release-taxes-62389540\">Harris,</a> ($1.9 million) and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sen-elizabeth-warren-latest-presidential-hopeful-release-2018/story?id=62288090\">Warren</a> ($846,394), to Inslee ($202,912).</p>\n<p>Of the seven 2020 candidates to release returns, at least three are millionaires: Sanders, Warren and Harris.</p>\n<p>Sanders, famous for his campaign against the unjust power of the richest 1%, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sanders-latest-democrat-release-taxes-revealing-millionaire-status/story?id=62406147\">reported an adjusted gross income</a> of $1.06 million in 2016 and $1.13 million in 2017. The bump in income those years was more than four times his income from a year earlier because of his bestselling 2016 book, &quot;Our Revolution.&quot;</p>\n<p>The senator, who joked before the release of his returns that if someone else wrote a bestselling book they, too, could be a millionaire, later said he was &quot;grateful&quot; for the financial success and that it marked a sharp contrast to his upbringing in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.</p>\n<p>Warren, who's also made anti-corruption a key focus of her campaign, is also part of the 1%, the documents show. Her adjusted gross income in 2018, after filing jointly with her husband, exceeded $846,000. Between 2013 and 2015, her adjusted gross income was over $1 million and neared $1.55 million in 2014 after her first book was released.</p>\n<p>Harris reported the highest 2018 gross income at $1.89 million. Her husband, an attorney whom she married in 2014, earned most of their income. For 2018, Harris reported just over $157,000 in Senate salary and $320,125 in profits from the book she authored ahead of her campaign announcement.</p>\n<p>Gillibrand reported $214,083 in adjusted gross income for 2018 and Klobuchar reported $338,121. O'Rourke has yet to submit his 2018 returns, but <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/2020-hopeful-beto-orourke-releases-10-years-tax-62420420\">reported</a> $366,455 for 2017.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/elizabeth-warren-memphis-01-ap-jef-190321_hpEmbed_2_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Democratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks to supporters in Memphis, March 17, 2019.

Karen Pulfer Focht/Reuters</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<h3>How much are they giving to charity?</h3>\n<p>The most generous candidate in 2018, according to candidates' tax returns, was Warren. She and her husband gave $50,128 to charity, almost 6% of her household adjusted gross income for the year.</p>\n<p>Next up was Inslee, who donated about 4% of his and his wife's income, or about $8,300.</p>\n<p>In comparison to other Americans with similar adjusted gross incomes, Warren donated about twice the average percentage -- which is about 2.7% for an income between $500,000 and $1 million, the latest IRS figures show. Inslee, who reported earning nearly $203,000 in 2018, donated about one and a half times more than the average percentage for someone of the same income.</p>\n<p>Sanders and his wife gave about 3.3% of their income to charity over the past two years. They gave $18,950 in 2018 and $36,300 in 2017. The couple also donated the proceeds of one of the senator's books, &quot;The Speech,&quot; though the donations did not appear on their tax returns, according to the campaign. The donations have gone primarily to &quot;senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities and environmental and housing advocacy groups,&quot; the campaign said.</p>\n<p>Sanders donated about the same as the average for similar income, according to IRS figures.</p>\n<p>Klobuchar and Gillibrand donated about 2% of their adjusted gross income in 2018, coming to nearly $6,600 for Klobuchar and $3,750 for Gillibrand. Klobuchar and Gillibrand's donations also match up with the average percentage that people at those income levels donate, IRS figures show.</p>\n<p>O'Rourke appeared to give the smallest percentage of his family's income to charity in 2017 -- a total of $1,166, or 0.3%, which falls below the average percent donated by someone of his income level, while Harris and her husband donated $27,000, about 1.4% -- less than half of what the average is for similar adjusted gross incomes, according to IRS data.</p>\n<p>On average, those who earn between $1.5 million and $2 million donate around 3.4% of their income to charity, the latest IRS figures show.</p>\n<p>Roughly half of all charitable donations come from households with annual incomes of at least $100,000,<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc506\"> IRS figures show</a>, but the percentage doesn't usually skyrocket as wealth increases. For example, while the average donation for an income bracket between $500,000 and $1 million is 2%, the average donation for those who earn at least 10-20 times more money, $10 million a year or more, is around 10.4%.</p>\n<p>&quot;The thing that's really shocking is, as incomes go up, people's propensity to give doesn't grow proportionally,&quot; said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Project. Burman tracked the donations by candidates in the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonardburman/2012/02/20/stingy-rich-people-santorum-gingrich-edition/#67170dca29f5\">2012 </a><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/elections\">election</a> and found some, like former President Barack Obama and candidate Mitt Romney, gave around 14% of their income to charity, while candidates like Newt Gingrich gave around 2.6%.</p>\n<p>&quot;If you're well off, you probably have an obligation to share with people who are needy,&quot; Burman said.</p>\n<p>Charitable donations can be tracked only after candidates release their returns, a tradition that has continued since former President Richard Nixon was in office -- but some point out that none of this information, which is often scrutinized, is required to be provided by law.</p>\n<p>&quot;If the biggest complaint [voters] can have from all these returns is whether ... the candidate is charitable enough, then this is a victory for all these candidates,&quot; Tony Nitti, a CPA and partner at Rubin Brown LLP, told ABC News.</p>\n<p>&quot;The fact that you have the transparency allows us to go through this exercise, so we know that there's nothing to worry about,&quot; Nitti said.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/sanders-3-gty-er-190416_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Democratic presidential candidate, Sen.

                "text": "A handful of Democratic candidates for president have released at least 10 years of federal tax returns in an effort to promote transparency and create a contrast with President Donald Trump, who's refused to release his returns both as a candidate and as president.\nHere are some of the notable takeaways from the new financial data of Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke:\nWhat they're earning\nOne of the most apparent takeaways from a candidates' tax documents is how much they're making each year.\nAll the candidates reported making more than $200,000, filed jointly with their spouses, in adjusted gross income in 2018, putting them substantially above an average American's earnings, ranging from Harris, ($1.9 million) and Warren ($846,394), to Inslee ($202,912).\nOf the seven 2020 candidates to release returns, at least three are millionaires: Sanders, Warren and Harris.\nSanders, famous for his campaign against the unjust power of the richest 1%, reported an adjusted gross income of $1.06 million in 2016 and $1.13 million in 2017. The bump in income those years was more than four times his income from a year earlier because of his bestselling 2016 book, \"Our Revolution.\"\nThe senator, who joked before the release of his returns that if someone else wrote a bestselling book they, too, could be a millionaire, later said he was \"grateful\" for the financial success and that it marked a sharp contrast to his upbringing in a paycheck-to-paycheck household.\nWarren, who's also made anti-corruption a key focus of her campaign, is also part of the 1%, the documents show. Her adjusted gross income in 2018, after filing jointly with her husband, exceeded $846,000. Between 2013 and 2015, her adjusted gross income was over $1 million and neared $1.55 million in 2014 after her first book was released.\nHarris reported the highest 2018 gross income at $1.89 million. Her husband, an attorney whom she married in 2014, earned most of their income. For 2018, Harris reported just over $157,000 in Senate salary and $320,125 in profits from the book she authored ahead of her campaign announcement.\nGillibrand reported $214,083 in adjusted gross income for 2018 and Klobuchar reported $338,121. O'Rourke has yet to submit his 2018 returns, but reported $366,455 for 2017.\nHow much are they giving to charity?\nThe most generous candidate in 2018, according to candidates' tax returns, was Warren. She and her husband gave $50,128 to charity, almost 6% of her household adjusted gross income for the year.\nNext up was Inslee, who donated about 4% of his and his wife's income, or about $8,300.\nIn comparison to other Americans with similar adjusted gross incomes, Warren donated about twice the average percentage -- which is about 2.7% for an income between $500,000 and $1 million, the latest IRS figures show. Inslee, who reported earning nearly $203,000 in 2018, donated about one and a half times more than the average percentage for someone of the same income.\nSanders and his wife gave about 3.3% of their income to charity over the past two years. They gave $18,950 in 2018 and $36,300 in 2017. The couple also donated the proceeds of one of the senator's books, \"The Speech,\" though the donations did not appear on their tax returns, according to the campaign. The donations have gone primarily to \"senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities and environmental and housing advocacy groups,\" the campaign said.\nSanders donated about the same as the average for similar income, according to IRS figures.\nKlobuchar and Gillibrand donated about 2% of their adjusted gross income in 2018, coming to nearly $6,600 for Klobuchar and $3,750 for Gillibrand. Klobuchar and Gillibrand's donations also match up with the average percentage that people at those income levels donate, IRS figures show.\nO'Rourke appeared to give the smallest percentage of his family's income to charity in 2017 -- a total of $1,166, or 0.3%, which falls below the average percent donated by someone of his income level, while Harris and her husband donated $27,000, about 1.4% -- less than half of what the average is for similar adjusted gross incomes, according to IRS data.\nOn average, those who earn between $1.5 million and $2 million donate around 3.4% of their income to charity, the latest IRS figures show.\nRoughly half of all charitable donations come from households with annual incomes of at least $100,000, IRS figures show, but the percentage doesn't usually skyrocket as wealth increases. For example, while the average donation for an income bracket between $500,000 and $1 million is 2%, the average donation for those who earn at least 10-20 times more money, $10 million a year or more, is around 10.4%.\n\"The thing that's really shocking is, as incomes go up, people's propensity to give doesn't grow proportionally,\" said Len Burman, a co-founder of the Tax Policy Project. Burman tracked the donations by candidates in the 2012 election and found some, like former President Barack Obama and candidate Mitt Romney, gave around 14% of their income to charity, while candidates like Newt Gingrich gave around 2.6%.\n\"If you're well off, you probably have an obligation to share with people who are needy,\" Burman said.\nCharitable donations can be tracked only after candidates release their returns, a tradition that has continued since former President Richard Nixon was in office -- but some point out that none of this information, which is often scrutinized, is required to be provided by law.\n\"If the biggest complaint [voters] can have from all these returns is whether ... the candidate is charitable enough, then this is a victory for all these candidates,\" Tony Nitti, a CPA and partner at Rubin Brown LLP, told ABC News.\n\"The fact that you have the transparency allows us to go through this exercise, so we know that there's nothing to worry about,\" Nitti said.\nHow much of their income is paid in <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/taxes\" id=\"_ap_link_taxes_Taxes_\" target=\"_blank\">taxes</a>?\nThe Democrats who released their returns all appear to be paying their fair share of taxes given their income, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute.\n\"None of these folks are seemingly cheating or getting away with anything,\" he told ABC News after reviewing the returns made public by the campaigns.\nHarris and her husband, earning about $1.9 million, paid at an effective tax rate of 37%, the highest among candidates who've disclosed returns. Gillibrand, who reported earning $214,083, had an effective tax rate of 14%, according to her returns.\nSanders, who released 10 years of returns Monday, had an effective federal tax rate of 26% in 2018, paying $145,840 in federal taxes on adjusted gross income of $561,293.\nWarren, with an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018, paid 27%.\nWith an adjusted gross income of $366,455 in 2017, O'Rourke had an effective tax rate of 22%.\nKlobuchar, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $338,121, and Inslee, who had a 2018 adjusted gross income of $202,912, round out the list with some of the lowest tax rates of 19% and 15%, respectively.\n\"There are often complaints that rich people are able to take lots of loopholes,\" Edwards said, referencing billionaire Warren Buffett's often-cited comments that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. \"None of these candidates seem to be as lucky as Warren Buffett. They are paying tax rates as high as people with similar incomes.\"\nWhile little is known about the president's returns, The New York Times reported last year that the president and his siblings allegedly used fake corporations to hide money received from their parents to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in taxes.\nThe White House called The Times report a \"misleading attack against the Trump family\" and claimed the IRS signed off on the transactions detailed in the report.\nKeep in mind: Most Democrats (as well as the president) have yet to release their returns\nWhile five candidates have released years of tax returns, most among the nearly 20 Democrats seeking the White House in 2020 have yet to do so.\nThe president has refused to release his, and the White House vows he likely won't.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush set the record for tax information released by a presidential candidate in 2016 by disclosing 33 years of returns.\nThe early disclosures, more than a year away from the election, are significant and represent a \"shift\" in the Democratic Party, Joe Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project, told ABC News.\n\"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why,\" he said.\nABC News' Kendall Karson contributed to this report.",

The president's two top White House lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Emmet Flood, are expected to be among the White House officials reading the report.\nBarr and a select few of his associates have been reviewing Mueller's 400-plus page report in recent weeks and making redactions. ABC News has learned that the White House has received a broad briefing on the report -- described as non-specific in nature, focused mostly on the mechanics of the report itself -- including that it will be divided into sections on obstruction and collusion and that certain portions will be redacted, according to sources familiar with the matter.\nWhite House officials and sources close to the administration say advisers to the president are most concerned about the possibility of previously unknown examples of potential obstruction of justice and what information Mueller's team learned from witness interviews, especially former White House Counsel Don McGahn who sat for well over 30 hours with Mueller's investigators.\nSources say the president hasn't privately expressed any concern over the contents of the report, and is not likely to read it in its entirety. White House officials will review the report, brief the president, and then release a statement that will come from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\"I heard it's going to come out on Thursday. That's good. And there can't be anything there because there was no crime.

In the last week alone, Harris' son testified that he warned his father about hiring McCrae Dowless, the man at the center of the absentee ballot-collection scandal called into question by investigators; Harris himself conceded that a new election should be called; the state board voted to move forward with a special election; and Dan McCready, the Democrat who finished second to Harris by just over 900 votes in November, re-launched his candidacy for the new race.\nIn a statement, the North Carolina Republican Party said it was supportive of Harris' decision, writing that it \"unequivocally support[s] his call for a new election,\" and that \"there are numerous quality candidates that are discussing a run.\" In his statement, Harris endorsed one of those potential candidates, Union County, North Carolina Commissioner Stony Rushing.\nThe state board of elections has yet to set a date for the district's new primary and general election. Last December, former Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger -- whom Harris defeated in a primary last year to earn his spot on the general election ballot -- said that he would not run again if there were to be a new election, and on Monday, former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory also ruled out a run.\nABC News' John Verhovek contributed to this report.",

And that uncertainty will continue to reign in the early stages of a historically diverse Democratic primary with well over a dozen declared candidates.</p>\n<p>The reports show an <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-trumps-election-campaign-announces-30-million-fundraising/story?id=62406080\">incumbent Republican president eager to build a war-chest</a> sufficient enough to hold off any potential challenger, and a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/taxes-town-halls-taking-trump-weekly-roundup-2020/story?id=62306307\">Democratic race</a> that will undoubtedly remain competitive up until the first nominating contests in 2020. It is also important to note that while <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/joe-biden-claims-progressive-record-running-president/story?id=61660664\">former Vice President </a><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/joe-biden\">Joe Biden</a> has not officially entered the race, he is presumably a candidate who would draw major interest from donors of all sizes.</p>\n<p>Here are five major takeaways from the reports filed with the FEC.</p>\n<p><strong>Top dollars</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sanders-latest-democrat-release-taxes-revealing-millionaire-status/story?id=62406147\">Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont</a> topped the Democratic field in the money race with relative ease, bringing in an $18.2 million total haul, followed by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kamala-harris-latest-2020-dem-contender-release-taxes-62389540\">Sen. Kamala Harris of California</a> who brought in nearly $12 million. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke raked in $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2019,<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/beto-orourke-sets-high-water-mark-dems-61/story?id=61753709\"> including a $6.1 million haul in the first 24 hours of his campaign</a>, a total that surpassed even Sanders initial haul.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2020-hopeful-pete-buttigieg-husband-planning-child/story?id=62421122\">South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg</a> brought in an unexpectedly impressive haul for a candidate who is still introducing himself on the national stage. Buttigieg, who officially announced his candidacy this past weekend, brought in over $7 million in the first quarter from over 155,000 individual donors, outpacing the four other U.S. senators in the race and cementing his status as a top-tier candidate in the campaign's early stages.</p>\n<p>&quot;Mayor Pete&quot; also had a relatively low burn rate, spending just $685,000 -- or less than 10 percent -- of his total fundraising haul.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/Buttigieg-rt-er-190414_hpEmbed_2_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>South Bend's Mayor Pete Buttigieg speaks during a rally to announce his 2020 Democratic presidential candidacy in South Bend, Ind., April 14, 2019.</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/2020-democratic-fundraising-numbers-give-early-snapshot-competitive/story?id=62113899\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> brought in just over $6 million, followed by her Senate colleagues: Amy Klobuchar with $5.2 million; Cory Booker with $5 million; and Kirsten Gillibrand with $3 million -- putting them all in the middle of the pack in terms of fundraising.</p>\n<p>In another surprise, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/andrew-yang-political-rookie-white-house-hopeful/story?id=62210322\">entrepreneur Andrew Yang</a>, who raised $2.4 million in the first quarter, outpaced two governors in the race, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Colorado's former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Yang also outraised as Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney, who loaned his campaign $11.7 million.</p>\n<p>In terms of cash on hand, Sanders also holds a significant advantage over the field, with $15.7 million in the bank.</p>\n<p>The early numbers also revealed the advantage sitting U.S. senators -- who ran re-election campaigns in 2018 -- have over the field. Both Warren and Gillibrand transferred large sums from their Senate campaigns -- Warren $10.4 million and Gillibrand $9.6 million -- which gives them some more flexibility to spend more money early. Warren spent 87 percent of the money she raised from individual contributions in the first quarter and Gillibrand burned through 81 percent, both at much higher rates than the rest of the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Grassroots success</strong></p>\n<p>A big theme emerging this cycle is the emphasis on the number of individual donors giving to a specific campaign, both for its indication of a candidates' grassroots support and because it is now one of the main <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-set-polling-fundraising-thresholds-presidential-debates/story?id=61082996\">criteria set forth by the Democratic National Committee (DNC)</a> for making the debate stage.</p>\n<p>Sanders again led the pack, announcing earlier this month that his $18.1 million came from 525,000 individual donors, well beyond the 65,000 required by the DNC and outpacing all of his rivals.</p>\n<p>Not all campaigns released individual donor numbers, but Warren said her haul came from 135,000 individual donors, while Buttigieg claimed over 155,000. Yang said his campaign had 80,000 individual donors to his campaign during February and March.</p>\n<p>Both Harris and O'Rourke's campaigns said their totals came from 218,000 individual contributions.</p>\n<p>According to the FEC filings, there were seven campaigns that raised a majority of their money from donors who gave $200 or less: Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Yang, O'Rourke, Gabbard and author Marianne Williamson.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, Gillibrand, Booker, Hickenlooper and Delaney all saw under 20 percent of their donations come from people who gave $200 or less.</p>\n<p>With a larger emphasis on small-dollar donations and a rejection of corporate money, expect the jockeying for the grassroots fundraising mantle to continue throughout the Democratic primary.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump's advantage</strong></p>\n<p>While the field of Democrats battled for fundraising supremacy, President <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>'s re-election campaign announced a more than $30 million haul in the first quarter of 2019, outpacing his top two rivals from the opposing party combined.</p>\n<p>According to numbers released Monday morning by the Trump campaign, the commander-in-chief took in $30.3 million and has $40.8 million cash on hand.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/president-donald-trump-ap-jef-190416_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>President Donald Trump walks on the South Lawn as he arrives at the White House in Washington, April 15, 2019, after visiting Minnesota.

The prolific conservative donor gave $5,400 in the first quarter of 2019 to the president's re-election campaign.</p>\n<p>Many of Trump's most high-profile backers, like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donate to outside groups and super PACs backing GOP causes. Adelson and his wife Miriam donated over $100 million to GOP-aligned groups during the 2018 midterm elections, and are expected to be among Trump's biggest financial supporters during his re-election efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Early signs of trouble?</strong></p>\n<p>As the data continues to be scrutinized, there has been some worry among Democrats that these numbers, even for top-tier candidates like Sanders and Harris, are lower than 2008, which was the last time the party saw a competitive primary. In 2007, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised more than $25 million in the first quarter, albeit against a less-crowded field which may be causing some donors to pause before deciding who they are backing.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/obama-gty-er-190416_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Former President Barack Obama speaks to young leaders from across Europe in a Town Hall-styled session, April 6, 2019, in Berlin.

                "text": "Presidential candidates submitted their first quarter fundraising reports to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and it's the first major barometer of who is breaking through in a crowded field and how well-resourced campaigns could be for the long race ahead.\nBut amid the clamor to scour the latest filings for indications of who's up and who's down, it's important to remember that a good fundraising haul is no guarantee of votes or viability. And that uncertainty will continue to reign in the early stages of a historically diverse Democratic primary with well over a dozen declared candidates.\nThe reports show an incumbent Republican president eager to build a war-chest sufficient enough to hold off any potential challenger, and a Democratic race that will undoubtedly remain competitive up until the first nominating contests in 2020. It is also important to note that while former Vice President Joe Biden has not officially entered the race, he is presumably a candidate who would draw major interest from donors of all sizes.\nHere are five major takeaways from the reports filed with the FEC.\nTop dollars\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont topped the Democratic field in the money race with relative ease, bringing in an $18.2 million total haul, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris of California who brought in nearly $12 million. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke raked in $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2019, including a $6.1 million haul in the first 24 hours of his campaign, a total that surpassed even Sanders initial haul.\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg brought in an unexpectedly impressive haul for a candidate who is still introducing himself on the national stage. Buttigieg, who officially announced his candidacy this past weekend, brought in over $7 million in the first quarter from over 155,000 individual donors, outpacing the four other U.S. senators in the race and cementing his status as a top-tier candidate in the campaign's early stages.\n\"Mayor Pete\" also had a relatively low burn rate, spending just $685,000 -- or less than 10 percent -- of his total fundraising haul.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren brought in just over $6 million, followed by her Senate colleagues: Amy Klobuchar with $5.2 million; Cory Booker with $5 million; and Kirsten Gillibrand with $3 million -- putting them all in the middle of the pack in terms of fundraising.\nIn another surprise, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who raised $2.4 million in the first quarter, outpaced two governors in the race, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Colorado's former Gov. John Hickenlooper. Yang also outraised as Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney, who loaned his campaign $11.7 million.\nIn terms of cash on hand, Sanders also holds a significant advantage over the field, with $15.7 million in the bank.\nThe early numbers also revealed the advantage sitting U.S. senators -- who ran re-election campaigns in 2018 -- have over the field. Both Warren and Gillibrand transferred large sums from their Senate campaigns -- Warren $10.4 million and Gillibrand $9.6 million -- which gives them some more flexibility to spend more money early. Warren spent 87 percent of the money she raised from individual contributions in the first quarter and Gillibrand burned through 81 percent, both at much higher rates than the rest of the field.\nGrassroots success\nA big theme emerging this cycle is the emphasis on the number of individual donors giving to a specific campaign, both for its indication of a candidates' grassroots support and because it is now one of the main criteria set forth by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for making the debate stage.\nSanders again led the pack, announcing earlier this month that his $18.1 million came from 525,000 individual donors, well beyond the 65,000 required by the DNC and outpacing all of his rivals.\nNot all campaigns released individual donor numbers, but Warren said her haul came from 135,000 individual donors, while Buttigieg claimed over 155,000. Yang said his campaign had 80,000 individual donors to his campaign during February and March.\nBoth Harris and O'Rourke's campaigns said their totals came from 218,000 individual contributions.\nAccording to the FEC filings, there were seven campaigns that raised a majority of their money from donors who gave $200 or less: Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, Yang, O'Rourke, Gabbard and author Marianne Williamson.\nOn the flip side, Gillibrand, Booker, Hickenlooper and Delaney all saw under 20 percent of their donations come from people who gave $200 or less.\nWith a larger emphasis on small-dollar donations and a rejection of corporate money, expect the jockeying for the grassroots fundraising mantle to continue throughout the Democratic primary.\nTrump's advantage\nWhile the field of Democrats battled for fundraising supremacy, President Donald Trump's re-election campaign announced a more than $30 million haul in the first quarter of 2019, outpacing his top two rivals from the opposing party combined.\nAccording to numbers released Monday morning by the Trump campaign, the commander-in-chief took in $30.3 million and has $40.8 million cash on hand.\nThe campaign did not release the number of individual donors to the president's re-election campaign but claimed to \"have already enlisted 100,000 new small donors in 2019,\" and to have \"acquired more than one million new small donors\" since Trump was inaugurated in January 2017.\nAlong with the numbers reported by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee announced Monday that it raised an additional $45.8 million in the first quarter of 2019, bringing the total pro-Trump fundraising effort to over $76 million, with $82 million cash on hand.\nSince his unlikely rise and victory in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Trump has proven to be a consistently productive fundraiser, and the advantages that come with running as an incumbent president will likely aid that prowess as he seeks a second term.\nFamous names\nAs always, the first round of FEC reports provide a unique opportunity to see who is donating to which campaigns at the outset.\nHarris, one of two California-based candidates in the race, received donations from a number of famous names, such as actors Ben Affleck, Reese Witherspoon, Eva Longoria, Jon Hamm, Wanda Sykes, Taran Killam and Jon Cryer, as well as producers J.J. Abrams and Shonda Rhimes.\nAmong Booker's most high-profile donors include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, former Google head Eric Schmidt, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and musician Jon Bon Jovi. Booker also received donations from actress Rosario Dawson, who he is currently dating.\nSanders received donations from actors Danny DeVito, Susan Sarandon and Thomas Middleditch, as well as musician Norah Jones.\nYang, who has seen an uptick in attention in part due to the online engagement in his campaign, received $1,000 donations from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Weezer front-man Rivers Cuomo and actor Noah Centineo, who starred in the Netflix film \"To All the Boys I've Loved Before.\"\nButtigieg also saw a number of donations from famous names like actors Mandy Moore, Ryan Reynolds and Bradley Whitford, former national security adviser and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice and James Murdoch, the son of conservative media titan Rupert Murdoch.\nTrump's over $30 million haul saw a wide range of donors, including one of his biggest backers in 2016, Robert Mercer. The prolific conservative donor gave $5,400 in the first quarter of 2019 to the president's re-election campaign.\nMany of Trump's most high-profile backers, like casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, donate to outside groups and super PACs backing GOP causes. Adelson and his wife Miriam donated over $100 million to GOP-aligned groups during the 2018 midterm elections, and are expected to be among Trump's biggest financial supporters during his re-election efforts.\nEarly signs of trouble?\nAs the data continues to be scrutinized, there has been some worry among Democrats that these numbers, even for top-tier candidates like Sanders and Harris, are lower than 2008, which was the last time the party saw a competitive primary. In 2007, both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama raised more than $25 million in the first quarter, albeit against a less-crowded field which may be causing some donors to pause before deciding who they are backing.\nAccording to an analysis by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan, independent and nonprofit outlet that tracks campaign finance data, the initial first quarter numbers appear to lag behind what the party saw in 2007.\nIn additional to the potentially troubling overall numbers, both Warren and Gillibrand's early burn rates may signal difficulty in sustaining their campaigns all the way until the first ballots are cast in February 2020.\nWarren took a significant step when her campaign announced that she would not be holding high-dollar fundraisers during the Democratic primary, a decision that played well to a party base that is rewarding candidates who shirk the traditional norms of fundraising but may present a challenge to her when it comes to maintaining her war chest.",

The 43-second video captures Omar saying &quot;some people did something,&rdquo; in reference to terrorists who killed thousands when they crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. The video, which features dramatic music and video of the chaos in downtown Manhattan, asks &quot;Some people did something?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But it does not show the entirety of Omar&rsquo;s comments.</p>\n<p>&quot;For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,&rdquo; Omar said at CAIR in California last March. &quot;CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Omar went on to say that the 9/11 attacks changed how Muslims are viewed in America and encouraged Muslims to not tolerate being treated as &quot;second-class&rdquo; citizens.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nancy-pelosi-ap-jef-190416_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaks during an interview with The Associated Press in her office at the Capitol in Washington, April 10, 2019.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is also Muslim, expressed frustration over how Democratic leadership was handling <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-continues-attacks-rep-ilhan-omar-hours-claims/story?id=62405648&cid=clicksource_77_null_headlines_hed\">Trump&rsquo;s attacks against Omar</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,&quot; Tlaib tweeted over the weekend, slamming top Democrats for failing to defend Omar from Trump&rsquo;s Islamophobic attacks while also insinuating their diversity is a prop for the Democratic Party.</p>\n<p>&quot;However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for &amp; why we ran in the first place, we are ignored,&quot; she continued, re-tweeting a California state legislative aide who criticized &quot;the attacks on @IlhanMN and subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership.&quot;</p>\n<p>Just hours after Omar released a statement reporting a surge of threats against her life following a tweeted attack from Trump, Trump again took aim at Omar on Monday by describing her as Pelosi&rsquo;s &ldquo;leader.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made,&quot; Trump tweeted. &quot;She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!&quot;</p>\n<p>Pelosi is also taking heat for remarks she made Monday at the London School of Economics, in which she seemingly downplayed her and Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s stunning midterm election victories.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When we won this election, it wasn&rsquo;t in districts like mine or Alexandria&rsquo;s. And she&rsquo;s a wonderful member of Congress, I think all of our colleagues will attest,&rdquo; the California Democrat said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But those are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water would win with a &quot;D&quot; next to its name in those districts,&rdquo; she said as she hoisted a glass of water.</p>\n<p>Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar all represent a new progressive wing of the Democratic Party that is calling for Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a more forceful response to fight climate change.</p>\n<p>Pelosi warned Democrats about taking the party too far left, saying &ldquo;our message, our progressive message, is down the middle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>ABC News' Meridith McGraw contributed to this story.</em></p>",

                "text": "Even as President Donald Trump continues his feud with Rep. Ilhan Omar, liberals are criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of not defending the freshman Muslim congresswoman quickly or strongly enough.\nIn an interview with local television station KSTP during a trip to Minnesota on Monday, Trump was asked if he had any regrets about his Friday tweet accusing Omar of downplaying the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook, she\u2019s been very disrespectful to this country. She\u2019s been very disrespectful, frankly, to Israel. She is somebody that doesn\u2019t really understand, I think life, real life, what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s unfortunate. She\u2019s got a way about her that\u2019s very, very bad I think for our country. I think she\u2019s extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Pelosi, on a congressional trip to London, was asked during an interview with CNN if she agrees with her critics that she did not defend Omar swiftly enough.\n\"Well, I haven't had a chance to speak with her, I'm traveling,\" Pelosi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.\nShe added: \"I don't even know what was said, but do I know what the president did was not right.\"\nOn Friday, the president tweeted a video that used footage of 9/11 with comments Omar made at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The 43-second video captures Omar saying \"some people did something,\u201d in reference to terrorists who killed thousands when they crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania. The video, which features dramatic music and video of the chaos in downtown Manhattan, asks \"Some people did something?\u201d\nBut it does not show the entirety of Omar\u2019s comments.\n\"For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,\u201d Omar said at CAIR in California last March. \"CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d\nOmar went on to say that the 9/11 attacks changed how Muslims are viewed in America and encouraged Muslims to not tolerate being treated as \"second-class\u201d citizens.\nRepublicans have criticized the seemingly passive reference to the terrorists who carried out the attacks, while Omar's defenders have countered that the remarks were largely taken out of context and have been seized on in order to stoke anti-Islamic sentiment against the Muslim congresswoman.\nPelosi condemned Trump for the video, but she did not initially mention Omar, who was the target of Trump\u2019s video, by name.\n\u201cSince the President\u2019s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life\u2014many directly referencing or replying to the President\u2019s video,\" Omar said in a statement Sunday evening. \"I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats.\"\nPelosi confirmed Sunday that she personally spoke with the House Sergeant-at-Arms in order to ensure the safety of Omar, as well as her family and staff.\n\u201cThe President\u2019s words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger,\" Pelosi said. \"President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video.\u201d\nFellow Democratic freshman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called on Democrats to respond to Trump\u2019s tweet and cautioned that if they were to remain silent, they would be \u201ccomplicit\u201d in Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\"Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the President\u2019s explicit attack today.@IlhanMN\u2019s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\n\u201cHas Nancy Pelosi ever visited a mosque in this country?\u201d said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the liberal group Justice Democrats in a tweet.\nPelosi spokesman Drew Hammill forcefully denied Shahid's suggestion in an emailed response to ABC News saying \"...the Speaker has been to many mosques in this country and throughout the world.\"\n\"This one group attacking the Speaker believes it\u2019s more important to raise money for their own organization than condemn the President\u2019s disgusting and vile attacks on Democrats,\" Hammill said of the Justice Democrats group.\nOn the president's attacks against Omar, Hammill said: \"The President is making these attacks because of the imminent release of the Mueller report in a desperate attempt to change the subject.\"\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., who is also Muslim, expressed frustration over how Democratic leadership was handling Trump\u2019s attacks against Omar.\n\"They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse,\" Tlaib tweeted over the weekend, slamming top Democrats for failing to defend Omar from Trump\u2019s Islamophobic attacks while also insinuating their diversity is a prop for the Democratic Party.\n\"However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored,\" she continued, re-tweeting a California state legislative aide who criticized \"the attacks on @IlhanMN and subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership.\"\nJust hours after Omar released a statement reporting a surge of threats against her life following a tweeted attack from Trump, Trump again took aim at Omar on Monday by describing her as Pelosi\u2019s \u201cleader.\"\n\"Before Nancy, who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done, decides to defend her leader, Rep. Omar, she should look at the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made,\" Trump tweeted. \"She is out of control, except for her control of Nancy!\"\nPelosi is also taking heat for remarks she made Monday at the London School of Economics, in which she seemingly downplayed her and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning midterm election victories.\n\u201cWhen we won this election, it wasn\u2019t in districts like mine or Alexandria\u2019s. And she\u2019s a wonderful member of Congress, I think all of our colleagues will attest,\u201d the California Democrat said.\n\u201cBut those are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water would win with a \"D\" next to its name in those districts,\u201d she said as she hoisted a glass of water.\nOcasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar all represent a new progressive wing of the Democratic Party that is calling for Medicare for all, free college tuition, and a more forceful response to fight climate change.\nPelosi warned Democrats about taking the party too far left, saying \u201cour message, our progressive message, is down the middle.\u201d\nABC News' Meridith McGraw contributed to this story.",

As part of the statute, Kraft would have to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a class on the dangers of prostitution and pay a $5,000 fine per count, according to Edmondson.</p>\n<p>The deal has been offered to Kraft and 24 other men charged in the case. No one has accepted the deal so far, Edmondson said.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/florida-prosecutors-offer-to-drop-charges-against-patriots-owner-robert-kraft-11553014972\">first reported news</a> of a proposed deal.</p>\n<p>Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg tweeted in response to the newspaper's tweet of their story on the plea deal that...&quot;The offer of a deferred prosecution agreement with several conditions to first time offenders is standard in cases like this.&quot;</p>\n<p>It was not immediately clear whether Kraft would accept such an offer. None of his three primary defense attorneys immediately responded to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Jupiter Police Department, which conducted the investigation, referred requests for comment to the prosecutor's office.</p>\n<p>The Patriots team owner had pleaded not guilty and opted for a non-jury trial, before a judge -- while <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/patriots-owner-robert-kraft-assembled-legal-dream-team/story?id=61581520\">assembling a powerhouse team of high-profile Florida criminal defense attorneys</a>.</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/orchids-of-asia-spa-01-gty-jc-190222_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>A notice sign from the Jupiter Building Department is seen on the front door of the Orchids of Asia Day Spa on Feb. 22, 2019, in Jupiter, Fla.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Florida criminal defense attorney Mark O&rsquo;Mara said that the Kraft deal is best outcome he could hope for short of a dismissal of the charges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In a pre-trial diversion, you divert the case away from the criminal justice system into what I&rsquo;d call a pre-plea probation,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Mara, who won George Zimmerman&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/george-zimmerman-face-civil-suits-death-threats-federal/story?id=19661599\">acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-florida-shooting-zimmerman-idUSBRE83O18H20120425\">fatal 2012 shooting</a> of Trayvon Martin.</p>\n<p>&quot;This is a variant of a pre-trial diversion ... In my opinion, a deferred prosecution agreement is much more informal, more of a letter contract between the prosecution and the defense,&quot; O'Mara said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best deal he can get, but I give kudos to his defense attorneys because they worked out the best deal they could without a complete dismissal. It&rsquo;s the best of all worlds, because you&rsquo;re not entering a plea.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Mara said such deals are generally reserved for first-time offenders.</p>\n<p>Even with the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/patriots-owner-robert-kraft-assembled-legal-dream-team/story?id=61581520\">charges dropped</a>, Kraft could still face discipline from the National Football League (NFL), which has a strict personal conduct policy.</p>\n<p>The policy reads, in part, that &quot;[i]t is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime. We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL, and is lawful.&quot;</p>\n<p>Twenty-five people were charged in the sting at the Jupiter spa, police said. Authorities set up hidden cameras at the spa and, Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp said, there's video evidence of all of the suspects participating in the alleged sexual acts.</p>\n<p>Stacey James, a spokeswoman for Kraft, 77, said in a statement at the time that &quot;[w]e categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.&quot;</p>\n<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has punished Kraft's Patriots more severely than any other franchise during his tenure, according to ESPN. He fined them $250,000, and coach Bill Belichick $500,000, for spying on an opponent's defensive signals in 2007.

                "text": "Robert Kraft, the owner of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, is being offered a deferred prosecution agreement in which he would not be required to plead guilty to any charges surrounding his visits to a Florida spa in January that was under investigation for sex trafficking and prostitution, a prosecutor in the case announced on Tuesday.\nKraft is facing two misdemeanor counts of soliciting prostitution for allegedly visiting the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida on two occasions earlier this year and paying for sexual favors from the massage parlor\u2019s staff.\nThe proposed pre-trial diversion program would require Kraft to either acknowledge guilt or admit that he would have been proven guilty at trial, according to the spokesperson for the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office, Mike Edmondson.\nWhile Kraft is currently facing a statutory maximum of one year in jail, if he were to accept the plea agreement, the misdemeanor charges would be dropped. As part of the statute, Kraft would have to perform 100 hours of community service, attend a class on the dangers of prostitution and pay a $5,000 fine per count, according to Edmondson.\nThe deal has been offered to Kraft and 24 other men charged in the case. No one has accepted the deal so far, Edmondson said.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported news of a proposed deal.\nPalm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg tweeted in response to the newspaper's tweet of their story on the plea deal that...\"The offer of a deferred prosecution agreement with several conditions to first time offenders is standard in cases like this.\"\nIt was not immediately clear whether Kraft would accept such an offer. None of his three primary defense attorneys immediately responded to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the Jupiter Police Department, which conducted the investigation, referred requests for comment to the prosecutor's office.\nThe Patriots team owner had pleaded not guilty and opted for a non-jury trial, before a judge -- while assembling a powerhouse team of high-profile Florida criminal defense attorneys.\nFlorida criminal defense attorney Mark O\u2019Mara said that the Kraft deal is best outcome he could hope for short of a dismissal of the charges.\n\u201cIn a pre-trial diversion, you divert the case away from the criminal justice system into what I\u2019d call a pre-plea probation,\u201d said O\u2019Mara, who won George Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin.\n\"This is a variant of a pre-trial diversion ... In my opinion, a deferred prosecution agreement is much more informal, more of a letter contract between the prosecution and the defense,\" O'Mara said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best deal he can get, but I give kudos to his defense attorneys because they worked out the best deal they could without a complete dismissal. It\u2019s the best of all worlds, because you\u2019re not entering a plea.\u201d\nO\u2019Mara said such deals are generally reserved for first-time offenders.\nEven with the charges dropped, Kraft could still face discipline from the National Football League (NFL), which has a strict personal conduct policy.\nThe policy reads, in part, that \"[i]t is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime. We are all held to a higher standard and must conduct ourselves in a way that is responsible, promotes the values of the NFL, and is lawful.\"\nTwenty-five people were charged in the sting at the Jupiter spa, police said. Authorities set up hidden cameras at the spa and, Jupiter Police Detective Andrew Sharp said, there's video evidence of all of the suspects participating in the alleged sexual acts.\nStacey James, a spokeswoman for Kraft, 77, said in a statement at the time that \"[w]e categorically deny that Mr. Kraft engaged in any illegal activity. Because it is a judicial matter, we will not be commenting further.\"\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has punished Kraft's Patriots more severely than any other franchise during his tenure, according to ESPN. He fined them $250,000, and coach Bill Belichick $500,000, for spying on an opponent's defensive signals in 2007. He fined the Patriots $1 million, stripped them of two draft choices and suspended quarterback Tom Brady as part of the 2015 \"Deflategate\" investigation.\nNews of the charges being dropped came the same day that a coalition of sexual exploitation and sex trafficking survivor networks wrote a letter calling on Goodell to investigate criminal charges against Kraft and if found to be true to strip him of ownership of the Super Bowl champions franchise, according to a letter released by the coalition on Tuesday.\n\u201cIf the results of [an NFL] investigation show Mr. Kraft to have engaged in the purchase of women for sex, the NFL must banish Mr. Kraft from team ownership because men who purchase others for sex inflict inestimable amounts of human suffering on those they exploit for sex,\u201d the letter reads, which goes on to call for the sports league to \u201ctake immediate action, rigorous measures to create a corporate and sport culture that respects others by rejecting all forms of sexual objectification, harassment, assault, and exploitation of women by owners, coaches, players, team personnel, and others associated with the NFL.\u201d\n\u201cThe prostitution marketplace is the context in which most sexual exploitation and sex trafficking transpire. The prostitution marketplace encompasses any of the various modes by which prostitution is marketed: strip clubs, massage parlors, \u2018escort\u2019 services, Internet-based prostitution websites, brothels, as well as pimp-facilitated, street-level prostitution, and pornography (i.e. \u2013 prostitution for mass consumption.)\u201d\nThe coalition, which includes groups like Breaking the Silence Together, Veronica\u2019s Voice, Freedom From Exploitation, Inc., DIGNITY House and the Survivor Leader Network, cite the NFL\u2019s own Personal Conduct Policy, which describes misconduct as \u201cconduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsibl[y] put innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, or undercuts public support for the NFL.\u201d\nThe NFL's media representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\nThe allegations against Kraft come three weeks after the Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the team's sixth Super Bowl title.\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of Kraft's then-NFL record $175 million purchase of the Patriots in 1994.\nABC News' Rachel Katz contributed to this story.",

On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally,&quot; Foxx wrote. &quot;Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should. &hellip; it's not who we want to be.&quot;</p>\n<p>Foxx's text messages to Magats appear to contradict claims she had completely recused herself from the case after speaking with one of Smollett's relatives at the behest of Tina Tchen, the one-time chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama. She said at the time she spoke to Smollett's relative, the actor was still considered by police to be an assault victim.</p>\n<p>In a March 27 interview with Chicago ABC station WLS-TV, Foxx said she decided to remove herself from the case a week before Smollett was charged after having discussions with her office's chief ethics officer. She said she told her chief ethics officer, &quot;I don't want any speculation or concern. I don't even want the appearance that my involvement with this case, having now seen or talked to a family member, would in any way impede this investigation.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;So, I made the decision in that consultation to say, 'Wall me off,'&quot; Foxx said at the time.</p>\n<p>The Cook County State's Attorney Office released the text messages on Tuesday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by media outlets including ABC News. The office released 178 pages of text messages and 3,655 pages of emails connected to the case, including communication among staffers and some of their interactions with the media.</p>\n<p>Some of the correspondence was redacted due to a court order sealing Smollett's criminal case.</p>\n<p>The messages offer a glimpse into the state's attorney's private thoughts on a high-profile case. The newly revealed correspondence between Foxx and her employees raises questions about the role she may have played in the case after her recusal.</p>\n<p>Her office declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing an ongoing review.</p>\n<p>&quot;As the case is currently under review, we are not in a position to comment on specificities related to this topic,&quot; the office said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;We look forward to the findings of the Cook County Independent Inspector General's Office's review of how we handled this case.&quot;</p>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/jussie-smollett-gty-jpo-190327_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Jussie Smollett waves as he follows his attorney after his court appearance at Leighton Courthouse on March 26, 2019 in Chicago.</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<aside><figure><img alt=\"\" data-mptype=\"image\" src=\"https://s.abcnews.com/images/Video/jussie-smollett-ap-jef-190326_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Actor Jussie Smollett talks to the media before leaving Cook County Court after his charges were dropped, March 26, 2019, in Chicago.

Paul Beaty/AP</figcaption></figure></aside>\n<p>Foxx faced fierce backlash from the Chicago Police Department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel when her office announced it was dropping criminal charges against Smollett in an effort to focus its resources on violent crimes.</p>\n<p>Emanuel said dropping the charges against Smollett &quot;is without a doubt a whitewash of justice.&quot; And city officials sued the actor for $130,000 last week, seeking reimbursement for funds spent investigating what they called <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/chicago-sues-jussie-smollett-130000-spent-alleged-hate/story?id=62349625\">bogus hate crime allegations</a>.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit laid out a detailed account of the allegations against Smollett, who told police he was attacked Jan. 29 by two men who shouted homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a noose around his neck and poured an unknown liquid on him. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-alleged-jussie-smollett-attack/story?id=61124090\">The timeline</a> includes a 41-point, blow-by-blow description, from when Smollett first met the Ola and Abel Osundario -- the brothers who say Smollett paid them to help stage the attack -- in the fall of 2017 until the final allegation that Smollett continued to be in contact with the brothers days after the alleged attack.</p>\n<p>A lawyer for Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox's &quot;Empire,&quot; said the actor &quot;vehemently denies&quot; accusations of making false statements to police and &quot;will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>ABC News' Josh Margolin, Lara Moehlman and Stephanie Wash contributed to this report.</em></p>",

                "text": "Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx referred to \"Empire\" actor Jussie Smollett as a \"washed up celeb who lied to cops,\" according to newly revealed text messages.\nFoxx made the comment to her top deputy, Joseph Magats, on March 8, just as news surfaced that the actor had been indicted on 16 counts for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked in a hate crime.\n\u201cSooo\u2026...I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases...16 counts on a class 4 (felony) becomes exhibit A,\u201d Foxx texted Magats, according to documents released on Tuesday.\nShe also compared the case against Smollett, 36, to her office's sexual abuse case against embattled R&B singer R. Kelly, to whom she referred as a \"pedophile.\"\n\"Pedophile with 4 victims 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16. On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally,\" Foxx wrote. \"Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should. \u2026 it's not who we want to be.\"\nFoxx's text messages to Magats appear to contradict claims she had completely recused herself from the case after speaking with one of Smollett's relatives at the behest of Tina Tchen, the one-time chief of staff for former first lady Michelle Obama. She said at the time she spoke to Smollett's relative, the actor was still considered by police to be an assault victim.\nIn a March 27 interview with Chicago ABC station WLS-TV, Foxx said she decided to remove herself from the case a week before Smollett was charged after having discussions with her office's chief ethics officer. She said she told her chief ethics officer, \"I don't want any speculation or concern. I don't even want the appearance that my involvement with this case, having now seen or talked to a family member, would in any way impede this investigation.\"\n\"So, I made the decision in that consultation to say, 'Wall me off,'\" Foxx said at the time.\nThe Cook County State's Attorney Office released the text messages on Tuesday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by media outlets including ABC News. The office released 178 pages of text messages and 3,655 pages of emails connected to the case, including communication among staffers and some of their interactions with the media.\nSome of the correspondence was redacted due to a court order sealing Smollett's criminal case.\nThe messages offer a glimpse into the state's attorney's private thoughts on a high-profile case. The newly revealed correspondence between Foxx and her employees raises questions about the role she may have played in the case after her recusal.\nHer office declined to comment on the specifics of the case, citing an ongoing review.\n\"As the case is currently under review, we are not in a position to comment on specificities related to this topic,\" the office said in a statement Tuesday. \"We look forward to the findings of the Cook County Independent Inspector General's Office's review of how we handled this case.\"\nFoxx faced fierce backlash from the Chicago Police Department and Mayor Rahm Emanuel when her office announced it was dropping criminal charges against Smollett in an effort to focus its resources on violent crimes.\nEmanuel said dropping the charges against Smollett \"is without a doubt a whitewash of justice.\" And city officials sued the actor for $130,000 last week, seeking reimbursement for funds spent investigating what they called bogus hate crime allegations.\nThe lawsuit laid out a detailed account of the allegations against Smollett, who told police he was attacked Jan. 29 by two men who shouted homophobic slurs at him, wrapped a noose around his neck and poured an unknown liquid on him. The timeline includes a 41-point, blow-by-blow description, from when Smollett first met the Ola and Abel Osundario -- the brothers who say Smollett paid them to help stage the attack -- in the fall of 2017 until the final allegation that Smollett continued to be in contact with the brothers days after the alleged attack.\nA lawyer for Smollett, who portrays a gay musician on Fox's \"Empire,\" said the actor \"vehemently denies\" accusations of making false statements to police and \"will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.\"\nABC News' Josh Margolin, Lara Moehlman and Stephanie Wash contributed to this report.",

His father, Kevin Kellom, has disputed that account. The agent wasn't charged.\nNabih Ayad, a lawyer representing Kellom's family, says an officer who earlier said Kellom had a hammer changed his story while under oath in the family's civil suit against the agent.\nThe Wayne County prosecutor's office said last week that it was reviewing new information in the case.",

items on the agenda have been discussed during his recent trips to Pyongyang.</p>\n<p>&quot;The two sides may discuss denuclearisation but I'm predicting that Trump wants negotiations with North Korea to be a win domestically so he will shy away from concrete dates and expectations when it comes to the nuclear issue,&quot; Ben Young, a North Korea analyst and historian, told Al Jazeera.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think they will try to nail down a peace treaty of some sort. That is a win-win for both sides,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>While some US politicians and analysts have speculated that Trump might agree to reduce the US military presence in South Korea - which totals around 28,500 soldiers - officials in Seoul and Washington have said troop levels are not up for negotiation.</p>\n<p>&quot;Patience with North Korea is not the worst option. Pressure on Pyongyang and forcing them into a corner with concrete dates in the very near future for denuclearisation may make North Korea feel bullied and subservient,&quot; said Young.</p>\n<p>&quot;North Korea is fiercely prideful and takes it national dignity seriously.

he said.</p>\n<p>The two Koreas are technically still at war as the hostilities stopped in 1953 with a truce signed by the US, representing United Nations forces, and the militaries of North Korea and China.</p>\n<p>The armistice agreement - adhered to but not signed by South Korea, whose leaders at the time rejected the idea of a ceasefire that left the peninsula divided - fell short of a peace treaty that has governed the conflict ever since.</p>\n<p>On Monday, a presidential spokesperson in Seoul said an end-of-war statement by just two parties - Pyongyang and Washington - would be enough, adding that the focus should be on leading &quot;North Korea to denuclearisation smoothly through the declaration&quot;.</p>\n<p>&quot;The South Korean government welcomes any form of end-of-war agreement if it plays a role to speed up denuclearisation.&quot;</p>\n<h2>What is the view in Seoul?</h2>\n<p>The talks in Hanoi follow a thaw in relations between North and South Korea last year, which saw Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meeting three times.</p>\n<p>During those summits, the two leaders agreed to a series of goodwill gestures, vowing to resume economic collaboration when possible and take steps to reduce military threats.</p>\n<p>Just like Pyongyang, the inter-Korean economic projects are also sought after by Seoul, including the relaunch of operations at the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Park, which has been suspended for three years.</p>\n<p>Located just inside North Korea across the demilitarised zone, the complex was launched in 2004 with the idea of South Korean companies manufacturing their products using North Korean labour, helping it improve its economy.</p>\n<p>To win some of those concessions from Washington, North Korea could follow through on shutting its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, as well as abolishing key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts, South Korean officials have said.</p>\n<p>&quot;Moon has invested a lot of political and emotional capital in improving relations with the North,&quot; Young said.</p>\n<p>&quot;The South Korean economy is having some issues at the moment so Moon could use improved North Korea-US relations as a mobilising force for improved domestic approval ratings.&quot;</p>\n<table> <tbody> <tr><td><figure><img src=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/2/26/d7710b5ac285407a87ab9523a0c01b89_18.jpg\"></img><figcaption>Preparations for the talks in Hanoi are in full swing [Kim Kyung-Hoon/Reuters]</figcaption></figure></td></tr> </tbody> </table>\n<h2>What is the likely outcome of the talks?</h2>\n<p>Analysts do not anticipate the Hanoi summit to end with a deal that will see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons, but have urged Washington to be open to taking interim steps for any agreement to be possible.</p>\n<p>Despite hopes for a major breakthrough being slim, there are some expectations the talks could produce a declaration formally ending the Korean War.</p>\n<p>For his part, Ko said he wanted to see North Korea &quot;agree on a process to dismantle Yongbyon nuclear facility&quot;.</p>\n<p>That facility, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, is functional.</p>\n<p>&quot;It's really business-as-usual at Yongbyon at the moment,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;People show up for work, and material comes in, and it looks pretty much like it's looked for the last 10 or 15 years.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ko predicted that the talks in Hanoi would see the US give North Korea some benefits that it needed on the political, military and economic fronts, but warned against walking away from Hanoi in the same &quot;hollow&quot; manner as the Singapore summit.</p>\n<p>&quot;The talk in Singapore was like 'Sanggyeonnye' in Korea - the first meeting between families of the bridge [bride] and the groom.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Now, it's time for the real plan.&quot;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Additional reporting by Sookyoung Lee in Seoul</strong></em></p>",

                "text": "Hanoi, Vietnam - Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are due to meet in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week, more than eight months after their landmark first summit in Singapore.\nHeading into the talks on Wednesday and Thursday, officials from both the United States and North Korea have not disclosed details about the focus of the meetings.\nIn an apparent bid to manage expectations, the US president in recent days has said he is in \"no rush\" to achieve denuclearisation, seeking, instead, a continuation of Pyongyang's pause on weapons testing.\nOn the North Korean side, an end to punishing international sanctions, along with a formal declaration that the 1950-1953 Korean War is over, are likely to be high on the priority list.\nOn the eve of the talks, Al Jazeera takes a look at what's on the table in the US-North Korea summit 2.0.\nHow did we get here?\nIn June last year, Singapore hosted the first meeting between a US president and a North Korean leader.\nThe historic summit, which came after months of growing tensions marked by nuclear and missile tests, fresh sanctions and threats of \"total destruction\", ended with a vague statement that has failed to produce tangible progress.\nIn Singapore, Kim and Trump outlined four commitments: establishing \"new relations\" for peace and prosperity; building a \"lasting a stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\"; working \"towards denuclearisation\"; and recovering and repatriating the remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.\nHowever, the agreement did not explicitly define denuclearisation - leading to disagreements over what it means - nor did it detail a specific timeline for the destruction of North Korea's nuclear weapons arsenal.\nWhat does the US want?\nAs Trump has made clear, the US is seeking an assurance from North Korea that it will stop testing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.\nIt also wants Pyongyang to get rid of all its weapons for its mass destruction programmes, as well as produce a roadmap and concrete plan of action on how it sets about achieving that goal.\nA recent report by Stanford University's Centre for International Security and Cooperation said North Korea appears to have produced enough bomb fuel in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.\nStephen Biegun, Trump's special envoy for North Korea, has reportedly said that a \"dozen\" items on the agenda have been discussed during his recent trips to Pyongyang.\n\"The two sides may discuss denuclearisation but I'm predicting that Trump wants negotiations with North Korea to be a win domestically so he will shy away from concrete dates and expectations when it comes to the nuclear issue,\" Ben Young, a North Korea analyst and historian, told Al Jazeera.\n\"I think they will try to nail down a peace treaty of some sort. That is a win-win for both sides,\" he added.\nWhile some US politicians and analysts have speculated that Trump might agree to reduce the US military presence in South Korea - which totals around 28,500 soldiers - officials in Seoul and Washington have said troop levels are not up for negotiation.\n\"Patience with North Korea is not the worst option. Pressure on Pyongyang and forcing them into a corner with concrete dates in the very near future for denuclearisation may make North Korea feel bullied and subservient,\" said Young.\n\"North Korea is fiercely prideful and takes it national dignity seriously. The last thing the Trump administration wants is a return to the days of 'fire and fury'.\"\nWhat does North Korea want?\nApart from the easing of sanctions and a declaration formally ending the Korean War, North Korea is also calling for the relaunching of some inter-Korean economic projects and the opening of a US liaison office in Pyongyang, according to Biegun.\nHit by food shortages and burdened by US-led international sanctions over its nuclear programme, which have cut it off from most global trade, North Korea last year shifted its focus to economic development.\nKab-Woo Ko, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Pyongyang \"needs to secure economic, political and diplomatic benefits from this summit\".\nIn case an agreement to officially end the Korean War is reached in Hanoi, Ko said a close watch should be kept on which of the sides would eventually sign such a declaration.\n\"It will be interesting to watch whether the deal is made between US and North Korea only, or if it will include China,\" he said.\nThe two Koreas are technically still at war as the hostilities stopped in 1953 with a truce signed by the US, representing United Nations forces, and the militaries of North Korea and China.\nThe armistice agreement - adhered to but not signed by South Korea, whose leaders at the time rejected the idea of a ceasefire that left the peninsula divided - fell short of a peace treaty that has governed the conflict ever since.\nOn Monday, a presidential spokesperson in Seoul said an end-of-war statement by just two parties - Pyongyang and Washington - would be enough, adding that the focus should be on leading \"North Korea to denuclearisation smoothly through the declaration\".\n\"The South Korean government welcomes any form of end-of-war agreement if it plays a role to speed up denuclearisation.\"\nWhat is the view in Seoul?\nThe talks in Hanoi follow a thaw in relations between North and South Korea last year, which saw Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in meeting three times.\nDuring those summits, the two leaders agreed to a series of goodwill gestures, vowing to resume economic collaboration when possible and take steps to reduce military threats.\nJust like Pyongyang, the inter-Korean economic projects are also sought after by Seoul, including the relaunch of operations at the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Park, which has been suspended for three years.\nLocated just inside North Korea across the demilitarised zone, the complex was launched in 2004 with the idea of South Korean companies manufacturing their products using North Korean labour, helping it improve its economy.\nTo win some of those concessions from Washington, North Korea could follow through on shutting its main Yongbyon nuclear complex, as well as abolishing key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts, South Korean officials have said.\n\"Moon has invested a lot of political and emotional capital in improving relations with the North,\" Young said.\n\"The South Korean economy is having some issues at the moment so Moon could use improved North Korea-US relations as a mobilising force for improved domestic approval ratings.\"\nWhat is the likely outcome of the talks?\nAnalysts do not anticipate the Hanoi summit to end with a deal that will see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons, but have urged Washington to be open to taking interim steps for any agreement to be possible.\nDespite hopes for a major breakthrough being slim, there are some expectations the talks could produce a declaration formally ending the Korean War.\nFor his part, Ko said he wanted to see North Korea \"agree on a process to dismantle Yongbyon nuclear facility\".\nThat facility, according to Jeffrey Lewis, a scholar at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, is functional.\n\"It's really business-as-usual at Yongbyon at the moment,\" said Lewis. \"People show up for work, and material comes in, and it looks pretty much like it's looked for the last 10 or 15 years.\"\nKo predicted that the talks in Hanoi would see the US give North Korea some benefits that it needed on the political, military and economic fronts, but warned against walking away from Hanoi in the same \"hollow\" manner as the Singapore summit.\n\"The talk in Singapore was like 'Sanggyeonnye' in Korea - the first meeting between families of the bridge [bride] and the groom.\"\n\"Now, it's time for the real plan.\"\nAdditional reporting by Sookyoung Lee in Seoul",

The bill now moves to the Republican-run Senate, where it also could pass, given some Republicans' concerns about the president's actions.</p>\n<p>If approved in the Senate, Trump has already vowed to veto the measure.</p>\n<p>Democratic leaders say the bill is not about the merits of Trump's wall, but how the president is trampling on the Constitution by grabbing money that he can't obtain through normal means.</p>\n<p>Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border earlier this month after Democrats refused to give him more than $5bn in funds for the wall. Instead, Congress passed a spending measure that included nearly $1.4bn to build 55 miles (89km) of border barriers in Texas's Rio Grande Valley, ending a dispute that had led to a record 35-day partial shutdown of the government. The spending measure does not include money for a concrete wall, however.</p>\n<h2>'Steals billions'</h2>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's emergency &quot;steals billions of dollars&quot; from military construction projects - including possibly family housing and child care centres - to build the wall with Mexico.</p>\n<p>Republicans counter that problems with drug runners and human trafficking give merit to Trump's manoeuvre.</p>\n<p>The president took to Twitter on Monday to urge Senate Republicans to stick with him.</p>\n<p>&quot;I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is trying to &quot;bend the law&quot; with his declaration of a national emergency on the southern border. He called on politicians to &quot;speak up with one bipartisan voice&quot; to put a check on the executive branch as the founding founders envisioned.</p>\n<p>&quot;What would stop a future president from claiming an emergency every week?&quot; he asked.</p>\n<p>But Republican Senator John Kennedy, parrying those claims, said that he would &quot;expect the next president, whether Democrat or not, would have a staff smart enough to know about the National Emergencies Act, and if the president wants to use it, he or she is going to use it no matter what past presidents have done&quot;.</p>\n<h2>Republican defections</h2>\n<p>On Monday, Republican Senator Thom Tillis said he would vote to block the order, joining Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski as Republicans supporting the resolution. Tillis added that Congress must defend its power of the purse and warned that a future Democratic president might abuse the power to advance &quot;radical policies&quot;.</p>\n<p>Another Republican, Senator Lamar Alexander, called Trump's order &quot;unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with the United States Constitution and I'll decide how to vote when I'm presented with something to vote on&quot;.</p>\n<p>Republican Senator Roy Blunt said there is &quot;no disagreement there is a problem at the border that we are not dealing with adequately&quot;.</p>\n<p>He added, &quot;There is a vigorous discussion about whether the emergency actions really fall into a category where you would define something that had been out there for a long time and Congress had already voted on.&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate voting on Trump's emergency order could drag under a rarely used procedure, which an aide said is possibly a first for the chamber. The law allows for up to 15 days of committee review - in this case, at the Armed Services panel - with a full Senate vote three days later. Senators, though, said the process could be expedited.</p>\n<p>To override a presidential veto, Democrats would need 16 more Republican senators to join them, an unlikely event, giving Trump the upper hand.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't think it will get here. It won't be overridden in the House,&quot; Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters.</p>\n<p>The wall was one of Trump's top campaign promises. He has long since dropped any pretence that money for the wall would come from Mexico, which he once claimed would be the source of funding.</p>\n<p>Trump's declaration of a national emergency gives him access to about $3.6bn in funding for military construction projects to divert to border fencing. The Defense Department has not identified which projects may get cut.</p>\n<p>But the administration is more likely to tap $600m from a federal asset forfeiture fund first. In addition, it is considering shifting more than $2bn from Defense Department accounts into a Pentagon counter-drug fund to be tapped for wall construction.</p>\n<p>Trump's edict is also being <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/sixteen-states-sue-trump-emergency-wall-declaration-190219015830687.html\">challenged in the federal courts</a>, where a host of Democratic-led states such as California have sued to overturn the order.

The rain is not expected to be heavy, but the soil is already saturated and rainwaters will drain into swollen rivers.\nLater in the week, skies will clear, but warmer weather that will melt more of the snow across the northern Plains and Great Lakes, helping to keep rivers and stream elevated through next week.\nAs spring continues to unfold in the coming weeks, more flooding events like this could be seen across the region.\nThere is still over half a metre of snow on the ground across some of the northern tier states, which will take time to melt. This stored water along with more spring storms will likely keep much of the low-lying Plains and Midwest states flooded for many more weeks.",

Police say it was a hate crime. The attacker is arrested and charged with murder.\nSwitzerland - December 2016: A 30-year-old man enters a mosque in central Zurich and starts firing at a handful of men who were drinking tea after evening prayer. Three are wounded.\nAnother victim was killed by the same perpetrator earlier in the day. The suspect escapes but is found dead near a river close to the mosque.\nCanada - January 2017: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, kills six Muslim worshippers and injures scores of others in an attack at a Quebec City mosque during evening prayers.\nThe fatalities include one victim who was killed as he attempted to tackle the gunman. Nineteen others are injured in the shooting. Bissonnette is sentenced to life imprisonment.\nUS - May 2017: Two men are stabbed to death after they try to intervene when a man starts yelling racial slurs at two women of Muslim appearance on a train in the north-western US state of Oregon.\nThe attacker is identified as 35-year-old Jeremy Joseph Christian. A third man is seriously injured.\nUK - June 2017: A 48-year-old man in London drives a van into a group of worshippers who had just come out of a mosque after a late-night prayer, killing a 51-year-old man and injuring nine others.\nThe driver, 48-year-old Darren Osborne, allegedly shouted \"I want to kill all Muslims - I did my bit\" after the attack. Osborne is sentenced to 43 years in jail on terrorism-related charges.\nSpain - August 2017: The number of crimes directed towards Muslims in Spain increases following deadly attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils as mosques in the cities of Granada, Fuenlabrada, Logrono and Seville are desecrated and firebombed.\nThree Moroccans are brutally assaulted in Navarre, while a Muslim woman is injured from in attack in front of a Madrid metro.\nNew Zealand - March 2019: Twenty eight-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant allegedly kills 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch. He is arrested and is facing charges.",

He also received a sentence of life in prison without parole in Maryland.</p>\n<p>The US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last year that he should be re-sentenced.</p>\n<p>The appeals court said Malvo's life-without-parole sentences were legal when they were imposed.</p>\n<p>But it said Supreme Court decisions since the shooting spree had found mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles were unconstitutional, and found this rule applied retroactively.</p>\n<p>The appeals court said a resentencing would determine whether Malvo qualifies as &quot;one of the rare juvenile offenders&quot; who can be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because his &quot;crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility&quot;.</p>\n<p>Instead, if his crimes &quot;reflect the transient immaturity of youth&quot;, the court said he's entitled to a sentence short of life without parole.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court will review that decision.</p>\n<p>As is typical, the justices did not make any comment in agreeing to hear the case.</p>\n<p>The top court will decide the case in its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2020.</p>",

He also received a sentence of life in prison without parole in Maryland.\nThe US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last year that he should be re-sentenced.\nThe appeals court said Malvo's life-without-parole sentences were legal when they were imposed.\nBut it said Supreme Court decisions since the shooting spree had found mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles were unconstitutional, and found this rule applied retroactively.\nThe appeals court said a resentencing would determine whether Malvo qualifies as \"one of the rare juvenile offenders\" who can be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole because his \"crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility\".\nInstead, if his crimes \"reflect the transient immaturity of youth\", the court said he's entitled to a sentence short of life without parole.\nThe Supreme Court will review that decision.\nAs is typical, the justices did not make any comment in agreeing to hear the case.\nThe top court will decide the case in its next term, which begins in October and ends in June 2020.",

The move comes despite opposition from the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html\">European Union</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;Any person or company doing business in Cuba should heed this announcement,&quot; Pompeo said.</p>\n<p>Pompeo said the administration was acting because it recognised the &quot;reality&quot; that the bar on lawsuits, which has been in place since 1996, had not achieved the goal of pressing <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/cuba.html\">Cuba</a> to enact democratic reforms or reining in what he called Cuba's &quot;export of oppression&quot; throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/venezuela.html\">Venezuela</a>.</p>\n<p>&quot;We see clearly that regime's repression of its own people and unrepentant exportation of tyranny in the region has only gotten worse because dictators perceive appeasement as weakness, not strength,&quot; he told reporters.</p>\n<p>Pompeo's decision gives Americans the legal right to sue companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties Cuba nationalised after Fidel Castro took power. It allows lawsuits by Cubans who became <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html\">United States</a> citizens years after their properties were taken.</p>\n<p>&quot;Those citizens' opportunities for justice have been put out of reach for two decades,&quot; Pompeo said.</p>\n<p>There are roughly 6,000 claims that the Justice Department has certified as having merit, according to Kimberly Breier, the top US diplomat for the Americas.

                "text": "The Trump administration on Wednesday opened the door for lawsuits against foreign firms operating on properties Cuba seized from Americans after the 1959 revolution.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he will not renew a bar on litigation that has been in place for two decades, meaning that lawsuits can be filed starting on May 2 when the current suspension expires.\nThe major policy shift, which the State Department said could draw hundreds of thousands of legal claims worth tens of billions of dollars, appears intended to intensify pressure on Havana at a time Washington is demanding that it end its support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The move comes despite opposition from the European Union.\n\"Any person or company doing business in Cuba should heed this announcement,\" Pompeo said.\nPompeo said the administration was acting because it recognised the \"reality\" that the bar on lawsuits, which has been in place since 1996, had not achieved the goal of pressing Cuba to enact democratic reforms or reining in what he called Cuba's \"export of oppression\" throughout the Western Hemisphere, particularly in Venezuela.\n\"We see clearly that regime's repression of its own people and unrepentant exportation of tyranny in the region has only gotten worse because dictators perceive appeasement as weakness, not strength,\" he told reporters.\nPompeo's decision gives Americans the legal right to sue companies that operate out of hotels, tobacco factories, distilleries and other properties Cuba nationalised after Fidel Castro took power. It allows lawsuits by Cubans who became United States citizens years after their properties were taken.\n\"Those citizens' opportunities for justice have been put out of reach for two decades,\" Pompeo said.\nThere are roughly 6,000 claims that the Justice Department has certified as having merit, according to Kimberly Breier, the top US diplomat for the Americas. Those claims have an estimated value of eight billion dollars: two billion in property and six billion in interest, she said. In addition, there are about 200,000 uncertified claims that could run into the tens of billions of dollars, she said.\nNo exceptions\nBreier said there would be no exceptions to the decision, which has already prompted stern responses from Canada and Europe as they have vowed to protect their businesses from lawsuits. She said the only way companies will be safe from litigation would be to ensure that they are not doing business on expropriated properties.\n\"European companies that are operating in Cuba will have nothing to worry about if they are not operating on properties taken from Americans,\" she said.\nThe decision deals a severe blow to Havana's efforts to draw foreign investment to the island and comes as President Donald Trump steps up pressure to isolate embattled Venezuelan President Maduro, who is holding power with help from other countries, including Cuba, China and Russia.\nSpain, which has large investments in hotels and other tourism-related industries on the island, was the first to react. A senior government official told The Associated Press that Madrid would ask the EU to challenge the US move through the World Trade Organization.\nBusinesses from Canada, France and the UK, among other countries, also conduct business in properties nationalised after Castro took power.\n'A dose of reality'\nNational Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to discuss the new policy during a speech in Miami, home to thousands of exiles and immigrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.

US immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the attorney general can rule in cases to set a legal precedent.</p>\n<p>Barr's ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration. This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts, a policy which has been <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/judge-blocks-trump-policy-returning-asylum-seekers-mexico-190408222448091.html\">challenged</a> with a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Several top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/homeland-security-chief-nielsen-resigns-border-turmoil-190408043111865.html\">forced out</a> this month over Trump's frustrations with an influx of migrants and asylum seekers at the US southern border.</p>\n<p>Barr's decision applies to migrants who crossed between official ports of entry into the US.</p>\n<p>Typically, those migrants are placed in &quot;expedited removal&quot; proceedings - a faster form of deportation reserved for people who irregularly entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles (160km) of a land border. Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond. But before Barr's ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.</p>\n<p>&quot;I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,&quot; Barr wrote.</p>\n<p>Barr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if DHS decides to release them by granting them &quot;parole&quot;. DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.</p>\n<p>The decision doesn't affect asylum-seeking families because they generally can't be held for longer than 20 days. It also doesn't apply to unaccompanied minors.</p>\n<p>Barr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days &quot;so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions&quot;.</p>\n<h2>'Another way to criminalise migration'</h2>\n<p>Michael Tan, from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision, and immigrant advocates decried the decision.</p>\n<p>&quot;We'll see the administration in court. Again,&quot; the ACLU tweeted.&quot;Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process&quot;.</p>\n<p>Angelo Guisado, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, tweeted, &quot;Mandating detention for what amounts to seeking asylum at the southern border is another instantiation of criminalizing migration.

                "text": "Detained asylum seekers in the United States who have shown they have a credible fear of returning to their country will no longer be able to ask a judge to grant them release using bond, according to a ruling by US Attorney General William Barr, who overturned decades-old policy on Tuesday.\nBarr struck down a decision that had allowed some asylum seekers to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, in a ruling that expands indefinite detention for some migrants who must wait months or years for their cases to be heard.\nThe first immigration court ruling from President Donald Trump's newly appointed attorney general is in keeping with the administration's moves to clamp down on the asylum process as tens of thousands of mostly Central Americans cross into the United States asking for refuge. US immigration courts are overseen by the Justice Department and the attorney general can rule in cases to set a legal precedent.\nBarr's ruling is the latest instance of the Trump administration taking a hard line on immigration. This year the administration implemented a policy to return some asylum seekers to Mexico while their cases work their way through backlogged courts, a policy which has been challenged with a lawsuit.\nSeveral top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were forced out this month over Trump's frustrations with an influx of migrants and asylum seekers at the US southern border.\nBarr's decision applies to migrants who crossed between official ports of entry into the US.\nTypically, those migrants are placed in \"expedited removal\" proceedings - a faster form of deportation reserved for people who irregularly entered the country within the last two weeks and are detained within 100 miles (160km) of a land border. Migrants who present themselves at ports of entry and ask for asylum are not eligible for bond. But before Barr's ruling, those who had crossed the border between official entry points and asked for asylum were eligible for bond, once they had proven to asylum officers they had a credible fear of persecution.\n\"I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,\" Barr wrote.\nBarr said such people can be held in immigration detention until their cases conclude, or if DHS decides to release them by granting them \"parole\". DHS has the discretion to parole people who are not eligible for bond and frequently does so due to insufficient detention space or other humanitarian reasons.\nThe decision doesn't affect asylum-seeking families because they generally can't be held for longer than 20 days. It also doesn't apply to unaccompanied minors.\nBarr said he was delaying the effective date by 90 days \"so that DHS may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions\".\n'Another way to criminalise migration'\nMichael Tan, from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said the rights group intended to sue the Trump administration over the decision, and immigrant advocates decried the decision.\n\"We'll see the administration in court. Again,\" the ACLU tweeted.\"Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process\".\nAngelo Guisado, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, tweeted, \"Mandating detention for what amounts to seeking asylum at the southern border is another instantiation of criminalizing migration. I find it perverse that we mandate detention (f***ing jail!) for what is at best a civil offense and is more aptly a place-of-birth violation.\"\nWe detain over 440,000 noncitizens each year.

And that would set the legal fight in motion.</p>\n<p>Barr has said he is redacting four types of information from the report.</p>\n<p>Congressional Democrats cite precedent from previous investigations in saying they want to see it all. But some Republicans defending Barr are also citing precedent, saying it is appropriate to keep at least some of the information from Congress and the public.</p>\n<p>Here's a look at what's likely to be withheld, and why Democrats say the full report should be released.</p>\n<h2>Grand jury investigation</h2>\n<p>Barr has staked out his position on releasing secret grand jury information, saying last week that he would not go to court to request its release. He said Democrats are &quot;free to go to court&quot; themselves, and Nadler has said he is ready to do so.</p>\n<p>Grand jury information, including witness interviews, is normally off limits but can be obtained in court. Some records were eventually released in the Whitewater investigation into former President <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Bill+Clinton+al+jazeera&rlz=1C1GCEU_enQA828QA828&oq=Bill+Clinton+al+jazeera&aqs=chrome..69i57.2344j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">Bill Clinton</a> and an investigation into President <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/richard-nixon.html\">Richard Nixon</a> before he resigned.</p>\n<p>Both of those cases were under somewhat different circumstances, including that the House Judiciary Committee had initiated impeachment proceedings. Federal court rules state that a court may order disclosure &quot;preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding&quot;.</p>\n<p>But Democrats have said they are not interested in impeachment, for now, and are likely to argue in court that they don't need to be in an official impeachment proceeding to receive the materials.</p>\n<h2>Classified information</h2>\n<p>Congress frequently receives classified documents and briefings, and Democrats say there is no reason the Mueller report should be any different.</p>\n<p>Many Republicans agree, including the top Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, who wrote a rare joint letter in March with House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff asking for &quot;all materials, regardless of form or classification&quot;.</p>\n<p>In the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Schiff and Nunes also asked for a private briefing from Mueller and his team.</p>\n<p>Democrat Schiff has argued that some of that information should be released to the public, as well, citing Mueller indictments that have already revealed granular detail about the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election.</p>\n<p>&quot;All of that information at one point was classified, but the decision must have been made the public interest outweighs that. And I think a similar analysis should be undertaken here,&quot; Schiff said on CNN this month.</p>\n<h2>Ongoing probes</h2>\n<p>Barr said he will redact information related to investigations connected to the Mueller probe that is still under way. Those include cases handed off or referred to federal prosecutors in Washington, DC, New York and Virginia.</p>\n<p>Democrats have noted that the Justice Department has released such information before, including some related to Mueller's own investigation while it was in progress. Republicans who were in the House majority last year, obtained documents related to the beginnings of the Russia investigation, arguing that officials were biased against then-candidate Trump.</p>\n<p>Republicans argued at the time that it was necessary to obtain that information to maintain the integrity of the investigation.</p>\n<h2>Derogatory information</h2>\n<p>The Justice Department regularly redacts information about people who were interviewed or scrutinised in investigations but not charged. Barr has said he will black out information from the report &quot;that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties&quot;.</p>\n<p>Asked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, at a hearing last week if that meant he would redact information to protect the interests of Trump, Barr said it did not. &quot;No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public officeholders,&quot; Barr said.</p>\n<p>That means that in addition to Trump, members of his family who work at the White House, such as his daughter Ivanka, could potentially be named if they were somehow entangled in Mueller's investigation.

                "text": "US Attorney General William Barr plans to release a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the inquiry into Russia's role in the 2016 US election on Thursday - the keyword being \"redacted\".\nThe Democrats' demands for a full, unredacted version of Mueller's report are likely to prompt a political and legal battle that could last for months, if not much longer.\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerrold Nadler, has said he is prepared to issue subpoenas \"very quickly\" for the full report on Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign if it is released with blacked-out sections. And that would set the legal fight in motion.\nBarr has said he is redacting four types of information from the report.\nCongressional Democrats cite precedent from previous investigations in saying they want to see it all. But some Republicans defending Barr are also citing precedent, saying it is appropriate to keep at least some of the information from Congress and the public.\nHere's a look at what's likely to be withheld, and why Democrats say the full report should be released.\nGrand jury investigation\nBarr has staked out his position on releasing secret grand jury information, saying last week that he would not go to court to request its release. He said Democrats are \"free to go to court\" themselves, and Nadler has said he is ready to do so.\nGrand jury information, including witness interviews, is normally off limits but can be obtained in court. Some records were eventually released in the Whitewater investigation into former President Bill Clinton and an investigation into President Richard Nixon before he resigned.\nBoth of those cases were under somewhat different circumstances, including that the House Judiciary Committee had initiated impeachment proceedings. Federal court rules state that a court may order disclosure \"preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding\".\nBut Democrats have said they are not interested in impeachment, for now, and are likely to argue in court that they don't need to be in an official impeachment proceeding to receive the materials.\nClassified information\nCongress frequently receives classified documents and briefings, and Democrats say there is no reason the Mueller report should be any different.\nMany Republicans agree, including the top Republican on the intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, who wrote a rare joint letter in March with House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff asking for \"all materials, regardless of form or classification\".\nIn the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Schiff and Nunes also asked for a private briefing from Mueller and his team.\nDemocrat Schiff has argued that some of that information should be released to the public, as well, citing Mueller indictments that have already revealed granular detail about the Russian effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\"All of that information at one point was classified, but the decision must have been made the public interest outweighs that. And I think a similar analysis should be undertaken here,\" Schiff said on CNN this month.\nOngoing probes\nBarr said he will redact information related to investigations connected to the Mueller probe that is still under way. Those include cases handed off or referred to federal prosecutors in Washington, DC, New York and Virginia.\nDemocrats have noted that the Justice Department has released such information before, including some related to Mueller's own investigation while it was in progress. Republicans who were in the House majority last year, obtained documents related to the beginnings of the Russia investigation, arguing that officials were biased against then-candidate Trump.\nRepublicans argued at the time that it was necessary to obtain that information to maintain the integrity of the investigation.\nDerogatory information\nThe Justice Department regularly redacts information about people who were interviewed or scrutinised in investigations but not charged. Barr has said he will black out information from the report \"that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties\".\nAsked by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, at a hearing last week if that meant he would redact information to protect the interests of Trump, Barr said it did not. \"No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public officeholders,\" Barr said.\nThat means that in addition to Trump, members of his family who work at the White House, such as his daughter Ivanka, could potentially be named if they were somehow entangled in Mueller's investigation. But any information regarding his sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, who run his businesses, could be more likely to be redacted.\nThe Justice Department did release information about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices more than two years ago, even though Clinton wasn't charged. But that was after then-FBI Director James Comey made the much-questioned decision to publicly discuss that investigation. Barr signalled in his confirmation hearing in January that he would do things differently.\n\"If you're not going to indict someone, then you don't stand up there and unload negative information about the person,\" Barr said. \"That's not the way the Department of Justice does business\"",

But, he said <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html\">Turkey</a> had made a strong case that should be heeded.</p>\n<p>Turkey is seeking an extension to a waiver that allows it to import Iranian oil without US penalties that were <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-administration-reinstates-iran-sanctions-181105051328043.html\">re-imposed</a> in November after President <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/donald-trump.html\">Donald Trump</a> pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The waiver expires early next month.</p>\n<p>&quot;We are expecting an extension for Turkey,&quot; Kalin said. &quot;We have made it clear we would like to continue to buy Iranian oil. People should not expect Turkey to turn its back on Iran just like that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Turkey <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/erdogan-sanctions-iran-wrong-aimed-unbalance-world-181106111233106.html\">did not support US sanctions policy</a> on <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html\">Iran</a> and did not think it would yield the desired result, Kalin said.</p>\n<p>The administration granted waivers to eight countries, including Turkey, allowing them to continue to buy Iranian crude provided they pledged to move to cut their imports to zero. Those waivers expire on May 2.</p>\n<p>US officials have said that three of the eight waivers won't require extensions because they have eliminated Iranian oil imports. But they have refused to say whether any of the other five will be extended. The lack of clarity has angered Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere who say that any waiver extensions will hurt the administration's &quot;maximum pressure&quot; campaign on Iran to press it to end what the US terms its &quot;malign activities&quot; in the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html\">Middle East</a> and beyond.</p>\n<p>Sources close to the matter told Reuters News Agency in March that Washington is likely to renew waivers for at least three buyers of Iranian oil and Turkey was one of them, along with China and India.</p>\n<p>Kalin said Turkey would not want to violate sanctions if a waiver were not extended.</p>\n<p>&quot;We will look for alternatives in terms of transactions and other things. We don't want to break or violate the sanctions but at the same time we don't want to be deprived of our right to buy oil and gas from Iran,&quot; he said.</p>\n<h2>Russia's S-400 missile defence system</h2>\n<p>Kalin also said Turkey wants a waiver for sanctions that will likely be triggered should it take delivery of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Russia.html\">Russia</a>'s advanced S-400 missile defence system over Washington's objections.</p>\n<p>Turkey's purchase of the S-400 has created a deep rift between the <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/nato.html\">NATO</a> allies, with US officials warning of significant consequences if it is finalised and Turkish officials saying it is a <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/turkey-defiant-threatens-ankara-russian-400-missiles-190404064751519.html\">done deal</a> that will not be cancelled.</p>\n<p>Kalin said Erdogan and other Turkish officials have been pressing Trump to use a presidential exemption to spare Turkey from sanctions under legislation known as the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which is aimed in part at Russia's defence industry. The exemption allows Trump to bypass the mandated sanctions should he determine it is in US national security interests to do so.</p>\n<p>&quot;If it comes to it, of course, we would expect President Trump to use his waiver,&quot; Kalin said. He stressed that he could not speak for Trump or other US officials but said that Trump had promised Erdogan that he would personally look into the situation. Kalin said he expected delivery of the S-400 system to be completed within two to three months.</p>\n<p>In addition to the sanctions, the Pentagon and State Department have said the S-400 purchase will jeopardise Turkey's participation in the US F-35 fighter aircraft programme.</p>\n<p>Kalin said Turkey was hopeful the US would agree to a Turkish proposal to set up a technical committee to review possible security threats posed by the S-400.</p>\n<p>Kalin spoke to reporters at the Turkish embassy as he wrapped up a trip to Washington, DC, with other senior officials in Erdogan's government, including the ministers of defence, finance and trade.</p>\n<p>In addition to their meetings with US officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the officials all spoke at the American-Turkish Council's annual conference on US-Turkey relations. The conference was held at the Trump International Hotel.</p>",

                "text": "Turkey \"expects\" the Trump administration to grant it waivers from the US related to its purchases of Iranian oil and Russian air defences, a top aide to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.\nPresidential spokesman and senior adviser Ibrahim Kalin told a news conference he could not be certain that the waivers would be granted. But, he said Turkey had made a strong case that should be heeded.\nTurkey is seeking an extension to a waiver that allows it to import Iranian oil without US penalties that were re-imposed in November after President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The waiver expires early next month.\n\"We are expecting an extension for Turkey,\" Kalin said. \"We have made it clear we would like to continue to buy Iranian oil. People should not expect Turkey to turn its back on Iran just like that.\"\nTurkey did not support US sanctions policy on Iran and did not think it would yield the desired result, Kalin said.\nThe administration granted waivers to eight countries, including Turkey, allowing them to continue to buy Iranian crude provided they pledged to move to cut their imports to zero. Those waivers expire on May 2.\nUS officials have said that three of the eight waivers won't require extensions because they have eliminated Iranian oil imports. But they have refused to say whether any of the other five will be extended. The lack of clarity has angered Iran hawks in Congress and elsewhere who say that any waiver extensions will hurt the administration's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran to press it to end what the US terms its \"malign activities\" in the Middle East and beyond.\nSources close to the matter told Reuters News Agency in March that Washington is likely to renew waivers for at least three buyers of Iranian oil and Turkey was one of them, along with China and India.\nKalin said Turkey would not want to violate sanctions if a waiver were not extended.\n\"We will look for alternatives in terms of transactions and other things. We don't want to break or violate the sanctions but at the same time we don't want to be deprived of our right to buy oil and gas from Iran,\" he said.\nRussia's S-400 missile defence system\nKalin also said Turkey wants a waiver for sanctions that will likely be triggered should it take delivery of Russia's advanced S-400 missile defence system over Washington's objections.\nTurkey's purchase of the S-400 has created a deep rift between the NATO allies, with US officials warning of significant consequences if it is finalised and Turkish officials saying it is a done deal that will not be cancelled.\nKalin said Erdogan and other Turkish officials have been pressing Trump to use a presidential exemption to spare Turkey from sanctions under legislation known as the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which is aimed in part at Russia's defence industry. The exemption allows Trump to bypass the mandated sanctions should he determine it is in US national security interests to do so.\n\"If it comes to it, of course, we would expect President Trump to use his waiver,\" Kalin said. He stressed that he could not speak for Trump or other US officials but said that Trump had promised Erdogan that he would personally look into the situation. Kalin said he expected delivery of the S-400 system to be completed within two to three months.\nIn addition to the sanctions, the Pentagon and State Department have said the S-400 purchase will jeopardise Turkey's participation in the US F-35 fighter aircraft programme.\nKalin said Turkey was hopeful the US would agree to a Turkish proposal to set up a technical committee to review possible security threats posed by the S-400.\nKalin spoke to reporters at the Turkish embassy as he wrapped up a trip to Washington, DC, with other senior officials in Erdogan's government, including the ministers of defence, finance and trade.\nIn addition to their meetings with US officials including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, the officials all spoke at the American-Turkish Council's annual conference on US-Turkey relations. The conference was held at the Trump International Hotel.",

On August 22, 2018, he pled guilty to eight charges, ranging from bank fraud and tax evasion to campaign finance violations. And in November, he also pled guilty to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-russia-mueller.html\">lying to Congress</a> about plans to build a Trump Tower Moscow in Russia&mdash;a real estate project that was abandoned.</p>\n<p>After that guilty plea, different groups of federal prosecutors&mdash;Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s team and the Southern District of New York&mdash;released <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/the-michael-cohen-sentencing-memos-are-damning-for-trump\">separate sentencing memos</a> on December 7. Mueller&rsquo;s memo described Cohen as a cooperative witness and recommended a more lenient sentence, while Southern District prosecutors viewed him less favorably in their memo. And on December 12 in New York City, U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III sentenced Cohen to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/politics/michael-cohen-sentencing/index.html\">three years in federal prison</a>&mdash;which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he will serve the entire sentence.</p>\n<p>There is no parole per se for civilians in the federal prison system in the United States, where parole boards exist at the state level (more than 50 altogether). But there is time off for good behavior&mdash;for example, cooperating with federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>In Forbes Magazine, Walter Pavlo (who has written and lectured extensively about white collar crime) estimated that Cohen will probably end up spending about <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2018/12/12/former-trump-fixer-michael-cohen-gets-3-years-prison-here-is-the-breakdown/#1103c4363262\">two years in prison</a>. According to Pavlo, Cohen &ldquo;will earn about 5.5 months in good time credit: additional days off of his sentence for obeying the rules in prison.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pavlo added that &ldquo;beyond that,&rdquo; Cohen &ldquo;can be placed at a halfway house and home confinement for a portion of his prison term. My guess is that he will get about four months halfway house/home detention. Total time served in prison will be about two years&mdash;a long time to be away from one&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Writing in New York Magazine in December, Nick Tabor predicted that &ldquo;if Cohen&rsquo;s sentence does stick, he could wind up serving <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/michael-cohen-might-not-actually-go-to-prison.html\">much less than three years</a>&rdquo; due to good-behavior credits as well as &ldquo;an early release to spend his last several months at home, under supervision.&rdquo; Tabor stressed that Cohen is a valuable witness for federal prosecutors, and valuable witnesses are less likely to serve their full sentences.</p>\n<p>One of the legal experts Tabor interviewed was David Kris, who was with the U.S. Justice Department under President Barack Obama. Kris told Tabor that in Mueller&rsquo;s Russia investigation, Cohen is considered more helpful than Paul Manafort (Trump&rsquo;s former campaign manager) but less helpful than Michael Flynn (who briefly served as national security advisor in the Trump Administration in 2017 and, like Manafort, is awaiting sentencing).</p>\n<p>Cohen could escape prison altogether if President Trump were to grant him a federal pardon. But Cohen has stressed that even if Trump offered him one, he wouldn&rsquo;t accept it. And given Trump&rsquo;s obvious contempt for his former employee, the chances of him offering Cohen a pardon are slim and none.</p>",

                "html": "<p>America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word <em>socialism</em>. We&rsquo;d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning of <em>freedom</em>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/03/study-warns-of-156000-oregon-households-at-risk-of-homelessness.html\">Oregonian</a> reported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they&rsquo;re on the streets.</p>\n<p>While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a &ldquo;free&rdquo; society.</p>\n<p>The words <em>freedom</em> and <em>liberty</em> are iconic in American culture&mdash;probably more so than with any other nation because they&rsquo;re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation&rsquo;s founding.</p>\n<p>The irony&mdash;of the nation founded on the world&rsquo;s greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves&mdash;is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring <em>true</em> freedom and liberty to <em>all</em> Americans.</p>\n<p>But what do those words mean?</p>\n<p>If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies&mdash;who slap those words on pretty much everything they do&mdash;you&rsquo;d get a definition that largely has to do with being &ldquo;free&rdquo; from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you&rsquo;re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior&rsquo;s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that&rsquo;s been embraced by so-called &ldquo;democratic socialist&rdquo; countries&mdash;from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia&mdash;you&rsquo;d hear a definition that&rsquo;s closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/34x5hx3\">second Bill of Rights</a>&rdquo; to be added to our Constitution.</p>\n<p>FDR&rsquo;s proposed amendments included the <em>right</em> to a job, and the <em>right</em> to be paid enough to live comfortably; the <em>right</em> to &ldquo;adequate food and clothing and recreation&rdquo;; the <em>right</em> to start a business and run it without worrying about &ldquo;unfair competition and domination by monopolies&rdquo;; the <em>right</em> &ldquo;of every family to a decent home&rdquo;; the <em>right</em> to &ldquo;adequate medical care&hellip; to achieve and enjoy good health&rdquo;; the <em>right</em> to government-based &ldquo;protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment&rdquo;; and the <em>right</em> &ldquo;to a good education.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Roosevelt pointed out that, &ldquo;All of these rights spell security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added, &ldquo;America&rsquo;s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt&rsquo;s advice to heart. Progressive &ldquo;social democracy&rdquo; has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century&mdash;a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s.</p>\n<p>Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today&rsquo;s GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of &ldquo;more industry in government, less government in industry&rdquo;&mdash;privatize and deregulate&mdash;and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent.</p>\n<p>He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring &rsquo;20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like &ldquo;the right to work&rdquo; to describe a union-free nation.</p>\n<p>In the end, the result of the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/01/05/the-gops-most-successful-scam-is-about-to-reboot-itself_partner/\">horses and sparrows</a>&rdquo; economics advocated by Harding (&ldquo;feed more oats to the horses and there&rsquo;ll be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrows&rdquo;&mdash;that generation&rsquo;s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II).</p>\n<p>Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular&mdash;the only president to be elected four times&mdash;the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others.</p>\n<p>The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide&mdash;nearly 30,000 in <a href=\"https://anightatthegarden.com\">Madison Square Garden</a> alone&mdash;encouraged by wealthy and powerful &ldquo;economic royalists&rdquo; preaching &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/american-liberty-league\">liberty</a>.&rdquo; Like the Kochs&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.freedomworks.org\">Freedomworks</a>, that generation&rsquo;s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts&rsquo; chemical fortune) organization was the <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y235gbue\">Liberty League</a>.</p>\n<p>Roosevelt&rsquo;s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war.</p>\n<p>Speaking of &ldquo;the grave dangers of &lsquo;rightist reaction&rsquo; in this Nation,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/34x5hx3\">Roosevelt told America</a> in that same speech that: &ldquo;[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called &lsquo;normalcy&rsquo; of the 1920s&mdash;then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR&rsquo;s New Deal&mdash;the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid&mdash;we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States:</p>\n<ul> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you&rsquo;re old and deep in poverty, so we have Social Security (although the GOP wants to gut it).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you&rsquo;re hungry, so we have food stamps/SNAP (although the GOP wants to gut them).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you&rsquo;re homeless, so we have housing assistance and homeless shelters (although the GOP fights every effort to help homeless people).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you&rsquo;re sick and can&rsquo;t get medical care, so we have Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare (although the GOP wants to gut them all).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you&rsquo;re working more than 40 hours a week and still can&rsquo;t meet basic expenses, so we have minimum wage laws and the right to unionize (although the GOP wants to gut both).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you can&rsquo;t read, so we have free public schools (although the GOP is actively working to gut them).</li> <li>You&rsquo;re not free if you can&rsquo;t vote, so we&rsquo;ve passed numerous laws to guarantee the right to vote (although the GOP is doing everything it can to keep tens of millions of Americans from voting).</li> </ul>\n<p>The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; means the government doesn&rsquo;t provide <em>any</em> of the things listed above.</p>\n<p>Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paul <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y4afdz2j\">famously did</a> in a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we&rsquo;re broke and sick, we&rsquo;re &ldquo;free&rdquo; to die like a feral dog in the gutter.</p>\n<p>Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP.</p>\n<p>Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America&rsquo;s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pay <a href=\"https://www.americashealthrankings.org/learn/reports/2017-annual-report/findings-state-rankings\">are almost all in GOP-controlled states</a>.</p>\n<p>America&mdash;particularly the Democratic Party&mdash;is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of <em>socialism</em>. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words <em>freedom</em> and <em>liberty</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Thom Hartmann is a <a href=\"https://www.thomhartmann.com/\">talk-show host</a> and author of more than <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thom-Hartmann/e/B000AQ449C\">25 books in print</a>.

                "text": "America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word socialism. We\u2019d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning of freedom.\nThe Oregonian reported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they\u2019re on the streets.\nWhile socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a \u201cfree\u201d society.\nThe words freedom and liberty are iconic in American culture\u2014probably more so than with any other nation because they\u2019re so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation\u2019s founding.\nThe irony\u2014of the nation founded on the world\u2019s greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves\u2014is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring true freedom and liberty to all Americans.\nBut what do those words mean?\nIf you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies\u2014who slap those words on pretty much everything they do\u2014you\u2019d get a definition that largely has to do with being \u201cfree\u201d from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you\u2019re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior\u2019s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function.\nOn the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that\u2019s been embraced by so-called \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d countries\u2014from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia\u2014you\u2019d hear a definition that\u2019s closer to that articulated by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a \u201csecond Bill of Rights\u201d to be added to our Constitution.\nFDR\u2019s proposed amendments included the right to a job, and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably; the right to \u201cadequate food and clothing and recreation\u201d; the right to start a business and run it without worrying about \u201cunfair competition and domination by monopolies\u201d; the right \u201cof every family to a decent home\u201d; the right to \u201cadequate medical care\u2026 to achieve and enjoy good health\u201d; the right to government-based \u201cprotection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment\u201d; and the right \u201cto a good education.\u201d\nRoosevelt pointed out that, \u201cAll of these rights spell security.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAmerica\u2019s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.\u201d\nThe other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt\u2019s advice to heart. Progressive \u201csocial democracy\u201d has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century\u2014a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s.\nJust prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today\u2019s GOP. In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of \u201cmore industry in government, less government in industry\u201d\u2014privatize and deregulate\u2014and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent.\nHe kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring \u201920s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like \u201cthe right to work\u201d to describe a union-free nation.\nIn the end, the result of the \u201chorses and sparrows\u201d economics advocated by Harding (\u201cfeed more oats to the horses and there\u2019ll be more oats in the horse poop to fatten the sparrows\u201d\u2014that generation\u2019s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II).\nEven though Roosevelt was fabulously popular\u2014the only president to be elected four times\u2014the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called \u201csocialist\u201d programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others.\nThe Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide\u2014nearly 30,000 in Madison Square Garden alone\u2014encouraged by wealthy and powerful \u201ceconomic royalists\u201d preaching \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty.\u201d Like the Kochs\u2019 Freedomworks, that generation\u2019s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts\u2019 chemical fortune) organization was the Liberty League.\nRoosevelt\u2019s generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right \u201cfreedom\u201d rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war.\nSpeaking of \u201cthe grave dangers of \u2018rightist reaction\u2019 in this Nation,\u201d Roosevelt told America in that same speech that: \u201c[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called \u2018normalcy\u2019 of the 1920s\u2014then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.\u201d\nAlthough right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR\u2019s New Deal\u2014the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid\u2014we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the United States:\nYou\u2019re not free if you\u2019re old and deep in poverty, so we have Social Security (although the GOP wants to gut it).\nYou\u2019re not free if you\u2019re hungry, so we have food stamps/SNAP (although the GOP wants to gut them).\nYou\u2019re not free if you\u2019re homeless, so we have housing assistance and homeless shelters (although the GOP fights every effort to help homeless people).\nYou\u2019re not free if you\u2019re sick and can\u2019t get medical care, so we have Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare (although the GOP wants to gut them all).\nYou\u2019re not free if you\u2019re working more than 40 hours a week and still can\u2019t meet basic expenses, so we have minimum wage laws and the right to unionize (although the GOP wants to gut both).\nYou\u2019re not free if you can\u2019t read, so we have free public schools (although the GOP is actively working to gut them).\nYou\u2019re not free if you can\u2019t vote, so we\u2019ve passed numerous laws to guarantee the right to vote (although the GOP is doing everything it can to keep tens of millions of Americans from voting).\nThe billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that \u201cfreedom\u201d means the government doesn\u2019t provide any of the things listed above.\nInstead, they tell us (as Ron Paul famously did in a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we\u2019re broke and sick, we\u2019re \u201cfree\u201d to die like a feral dog in the gutter.\nFreedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP.\nPoverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America\u2019s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pay are almost all in GOP-controlled states.\nAmerica\u2014particularly the Democratic Party\u2014is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of socialism. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the words freedom and liberty.\nThom Hartmann is a talk-show host and author of more than 25 books in print.

Adam Schiff</a> (D-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, believes the possibility that Russia may have leverage over Trump may not be getting enough scrutiny.</p>\n<p>And near the end of the article, Schiff makes an argument that I&rsquo;ve previously <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2019/02/why-the-collusion-matters-heres-what-almost-everyone-misses-about-the-origins-of-robert-muellers-investigation/\">referenced</a> but is routinely ignored &mdash; even in the very NBC News report that quoted the committee chair.</p>\n<p>In the last three paragraphs of the article, reporter Ken Dilanian writes:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Schiff said he is particularly concerned about the Trump Tower Moscow project, the real estate development Cohen was pitching to the Kremlin while Trump was running for president. </p><p>He noted that when it first emerged that Cohen had emailed Putin&rsquo;s office seeking help, Putin&rsquo;s spokesman, Dmitri Pescov, said he never answered the email.

Cohen has since pleaded guilty to those criminal lies. And when he testified before the House Government Oversight Committee in February, Cohen said he told these lies in an effort to please the president and follow his lead. At one meeting to discuss the Russia investigation before he lied to Congress, Cohen said, he spoke with Trump and was told &mdash; falsely &mdash; there was no &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; and no &ldquo;deal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So, in essence, Trump&rsquo;s personal attorney committed a crime to further a cover-up that was done in concert with &mdash; either explicitly or implicitly &mdash; the Kremlin.

They know the odds are against them &mdash; the bankers, bugs, monopolists, violent weather and sorry politicians. Yet, they keep at it as long as they can; working long and hard hours, enduring arduous conditions and tremendous stress to nurture the seeds that bring us an abundance of foods. But sometimes, the odds bunch up. Coping with natural disasters is to be expected. It&rsquo;s the unnatural disasters of rigged economic policies, Wall Street greed and unrestrained corporate profiteering that slam the door on good, efficient family farmers, making it impossible for them to keep producing.</p>\n<p>This is one of those times. Aside from the rise of floods, drought, tornados, etc. (hello, climate change), farmers are now in the sixth year of plummeting prices for their crops and livestock. They&rsquo;re producing more than ever but getting less. For example, it costs dairy farmers on average $1.92 to produce a gallon of milk, but the giant processors pay them only a-buck-32 per gallon. No surprise then that since 2000, half of America&rsquo;s dairy farmers have been squeezed out of business by monopoly pricing. And now comes Trump&rsquo;s trade spat with China, which has collapsed the market and prices for grain farmers. Overall, farmers&rsquo; profits have fallen by almost half in the last five years. Farm debt, bankruptcies, sales and suicides are rising towards the calamitous levels of the 1980s farm crisis, and concentrated corporate power is fast tightening its grip on nearly all food production, prices and policies.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a central cause of the spreading farm depression is the increasing monopolization of all the things farmers must buy (from seeds to machinery) and of the markets that buy from them. The big four biotech ag giants, for example, control 63 percent of all commercial seeds sold in the world; four meat processors control 84 percent of the U.S. beef market; and four global traders control up to 90 percent of the world&rsquo;s grain sales. Our farmers and their families are hurting, but so far, our leaders, including the president, aren&rsquo;t helping them.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the president, have you noticed how often Donald Trump prefaces his policy statements with phrases like &ldquo;frankly,&rdquo; &ldquo;honestly,&rdquo; &ldquo;to tell the truth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;believe me&rdquo;?</p>\n<p>More than a verbal tic, his constant use of these qualifiers subliminally admits that being frank, honest, truthful and believable is not normal for him. So, like a carnival flimflammer selling snake oil, he strains to convince us rubes that he&rsquo;s not flimflamming: &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he claims with lying lips, &ldquo;in all candor, this time I&rsquo;m truly telling you the gospel truth. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Among those who&rsquo;re learning about the truthiness of The Donald are the farmers who voted for him, having bought his campaign promise to stand up for them and restore farm prosperity. Once in office, though, he quickly sold them out. First, he threw a hissy-fit of a trade war with China that ended up slapping down U.S. farmers by drastically worsening the already-low prices they were getting for their crops. Instead of prosperity, the average farm profit last year was minus $1,500!</p>\n<p>Then, trying to smooth over this betrayal of the heartland, Trump tweeted out a message to ag producers in December that probably didn&rsquo;t warm that many hearts: &ldquo;Farmers, I LOVE YOU!&rdquo; he professed in capital letters. (I&rsquo;m guessing he offered the same sweet insincerity to Stormy Daniels after he &hellip; well, you know.)</p>\n<p>Actions speak louder than words, of course. On March 11, Trump then took action to express his true love for farmers: He whacked $3.6 billion from the safety-net programs that offer a measure of relief to hard-hit producers when crop prices crash. Revealing his plutocratic core, the cuts specifically targeted programs that benefit small farmers &mdash; a deliberate manipulation meant to drive more families off the land and increase corporate monopolization of agriculture.</p>\n<p>Not satisfied with intentionally injuring family farmers, Trump added insult by calling the dab of support they get from the government &ldquo;overly generous.&rdquo; This from a real estate flimflammer who continues to rake in millions of dollars in government cash and special tax breaks.</p>\n<p>Far from stepping up to stop this robbery of farmers, ransacking of rural vitality and rip-off of consumers, Congress and Trump coddle the monopolistic robbers, ransackers, and rip-off artists. To help counter their insanity, join forces with the grassroots power of Farm Aid.</p>\n<p><em>Populist author, public speaker and radio commentator Jim Hightower writes &ldquo;The Hightower Lowdown,&rdquo; a monthly newsletter chronicling the ongoing fights by America&rsquo;s ordinary people against rule by plutocratic elites.

We can do this by examining how memory works and how memories become distorted.\nUsing this viewpoint generates some tips you can use to work out whether you\u2019re reading or sharing fake news \u2013 which might be handy in the coming election period.\nHow memory gets distorted at the source\nFake news often relies on misattribution \u2013 instances in which we can retrieve things from memory but can\u2019t remember their source.\nMisattribution is one of the reasons advertising is so effective. We see a product and feel a pleasant sense of familiarity because we\u2019ve encountered it before, but fail to remember that the source of the memory was an ad.\nOne study examined headlines from fake news published during the 2016 US Presidential Election.\nThe researchers found even one presentation of a headline (such as \u201cDonald Trump Sent His Own Plane to Transport 200 Stranded Marines\u201d, based on claims shown to be false) was enough to increase belief in its content.

Dubbed false-memory diets, it is said that false memories of food experiences can encourage people to avoid fatty foods, alcohol and even convince them to love asparagus.\nCreative people that have a strong ability to associate different words are especially susceptible to false memories. Some people might be more vulnerable than others to believe fake news, but everyone is at risk.\nHow bias can reinforce fake news\nBias is how our feelings and worldview affect the encoding and retrieval of memory. We might like to think of our memory as an archivist that carefully preserves events, but sometimes it\u2019s more like a storyteller. Memories are shaped by our beliefs and can function to maintain a consistent narrative rather than an accurate record.\nAn example of this is selective exposure, our tendency to seek information that reinforces our pre-existing beliefs and to avoid information that brings those beliefs into question. This effect is supported by evidence that television news audiences are overwhelmingly partisan and exist in their own echo chambers.\nIt was thought that online communities exhibit the same behaviour, contributing to the spread of fake news, but this appears to be a myth. Political news sites are often populated by people with diverse ideological backgrounds and echo chambers are more likely to exist in real life than online.\nOur brains are wired to assume things we believe originated from a credible source. But are we more inclined to remember information that reinforces our beliefs? This is probably not the case.\nPeople who hold strong beliefs remember things that are relevant to their beliefs but they remember opposing information too. This happens because people are motivated to defend their beliefs against opposing views.\nBelief echoes are a related phenomenon that highlight the difficulty of correcting misinformation. Fake news is often designed to be attention-grabbing.\nIt can continue to shape people\u2019s attitudes after it has been discredited because it produces a vivid emotional reaction and builds on our existing narratives.\nCorrections have a much smaller emotional impact, especially if they require policy details, so should be designed to satisfy a similar narrative urge to be effective.\nTips for resisting fake news\nThe way our memory works means it might be impossible to resist fake news completely.\nBut one approach is to start thinking like a scientist. This involves adopting a questioning attitude that is motivated by curiosity, and being aware of personal bias.\nFor fake news, this might involve asking ourselves the following questions:\nWhat type of content is this? Many people rely on social media and aggregators as their main source of news. By reflecting on whether information is news, opinion or even humour, this can help consolidate information more completely into memory.\nWhere is it published? Paying attention to where information is published is crucial for encoding the source of information into memory. If something is a big deal, a wide variety of sources will discuss it, so attending to this detail is important.\nWho benefits? Reflecting on who benefits from you believing the content helps consolidate the source of that information into memory. It can also help us reflect on our own interests and whether our personal biases are at play.\nSome people tend to be more susceptible to fake news because they are more accepting of weak claims.\nBut we can strive to be more reflective in our open-mindedness by paying attention to the source of information, and questioning our own knowledge if and when we are unable to remember the context of our memories.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
