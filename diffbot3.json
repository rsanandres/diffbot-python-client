The White House had scheduled a signing ceremony but abruptly canceled it along with a lunch when it became clear an agreement could not be reached.</p>\n<p>Pompeo spoke as he flew to Manila from Hanoi, Vietnam, for talks with senior Philippines officials.</p>\n<p>__</p>\n<p>6:35 p.m.</p>\n<p>South Korea&rsquo;s presidential office says U.S. President Donald Trump regretted the collapse of his nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam but expressed &ldquo;firm&rdquo; commitment to continue negotiations.</p>\n<p>The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that Trump in a phone conversation with Moon discussed the details of his talks with Kim as he flew out of Vietnam.</p>\n<p>The Blue House says Moon encouraged Trump to continue his efforts for accomplishing the &ldquo;historic feat of resolving the world&rsquo;s last remaining Cold War rivalry.&rdquo; It says the leaders agreed to meet soon to discuss the nuclear issue.</p>\n<p>Trump says he &ldquo;walked away&rdquo; from talks with Kim after it was clear the two sides remained at odds over ending the North&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Kim was asked whether he was ready to denuclearize and said, &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m not willing to do that I won&rsquo;t be here right now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>5:10 p.m.</p>\n<p>The Kremlin says that talks at the U.S.-North Korean nuclear summit in Vietnam appear to have failed because the parties proved unwilling to compromise and make concessions.</p>\n<p>Talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wrapped up two hours earlier on Thursday after the parties failed to reach an agreement. Trump says the U.S. was unwilling to meet North Korea&rsquo;s demand to remove all U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of a North Korean nuclear facility.</p>\n<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow is encouraged by the fact the negotiations did not break down completely. But Peskov laments the lack of &ldquo;small steps&rdquo; and flexibility that could have helped to achieve some progress.</p>\n<p>Peskov says the North Korean nuclear program is a complicated issue that is &ldquo;impossible to solve in one go.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>4:55 p.m.</p>\n<p>China says the U.S. and North Korea must &ldquo;meet each other halfway&rdquo; after no agreement was reached between the two countries&rsquo; leaders during their nuclear summit in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said during a regular news briefing Thursday that the situation in the Korean Peninsula experienced a significant &ldquo;turnaround&rdquo; over the past year, a &ldquo;hard-won result&rdquo; that is worth cherishing.</p>\n<p>Lu says the U.S. and North Korea have returned to the correct path toward a political settlement, which is &ldquo;the only way out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>During his post-summit press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump called Chinese leader Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) &ldquo;a highly-respected leader all over the world&rdquo; who has been &ldquo;very helpful&rdquo; with North Korea. Trump says China is highly influential because of its high volume of trade with North Korea.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>4:30 p.m.</p>\n<p>South Korea&rsquo;s presidential office says it was &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; that U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to produce an agreement in their high-stakes nuclear summit in Vietnam. But it says it expects &ldquo;active dialogue&rdquo; to continue between Washington and Pyongyang.</p>\n<p>The Blue House said Thursday it believes Washington and Pyongyang deepened their understandings of each other during their &ldquo;long and deep discussions&rdquo; in Hanoi.</p>\n<p>It says Trump raising the possibility of sanctions relief in exchange for nuclear disarmament steps from the North shows that the nuclear negotiations between the countries have entered an &ldquo;elevated level.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The collapse of the Trump-Kim summit could prove to be a setback for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, whose ambitions for inter-Korean engagement hinge on a nuclear breakthrough between Washington and Pyongyang.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>3:50 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump has departed Vietnam after failing to reach an agreement during his second nuclear summit with North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p>The U.S. leader said he &ldquo;walked away&rdquo; from talks with Kim after it was clear the two sides remained at odds in talks over ending the North&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Trump says the North had demanded a full removal of U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of the North&rsquo;s Yongbyon nuclear facility, and the U.S. wouldn&rsquo;t agree to that.</p>\n<p>Trump took off from Hanoi more than two hours early after the abrupt change in schedule. Air Force One is scheduled to refuel in Anchorage, Alaska, before returning to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington late Thursday.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>3:40 p.m.</p>\n<p>South Korean media are reacting with alarm over the collapse of the nuclear summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>\n<p>Yonhap news agency said Thursday that the clock on the security situation of the Korean Peninsula has &ldquo;turned back to zero&rdquo; and that the diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff with the North was now &ldquo;at a crossroads.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Financial News wondered whether Washington and Pyongyang would struggle to keep the momentum of dialogue alive and anticipated the nuclear negotiations becoming a prolonged battle.</p>\n<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met with Kim three times last year and lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang, was expected to comment on the outcome of the Trump-Kim summit later Thursday.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>3:25 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump is hopeful that India and Pakistan may be on the cusp of progress after the two countries exchanged gunfire through the night along the Kashmir region a day after Islamabad said it shot down two Indian warplanes and captured a pilot.</p>\n<p>Trump told reporters Thursday at the end of a two-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam that India and Pakistan have &ldquo;been going at it&rdquo; and that the U.S. has been involved, &ldquo;trying to help them both out&rdquo; to &ldquo;see if we can get some organization and some peace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He says: &ldquo;I think probably that&rsquo;s going to be happening,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;We have, I think, reasonably attractive news from Pakistan and India.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>World powers have called on the two nations to de-escalate tensions that have gripped the region since a Feb. 14 suicide car bombing killed over 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. The situation escalated with Wednesday&rsquo;s aerial skirmish.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>3:05 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump says his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un fell through after the North demanded a full removal of U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of the North&rsquo;s Yongbyon nuclear facility.</p>\n<p>Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Vietnam on Thursday that the United States wasn&rsquo;t willing to make a deal without the North committing to giving up its secretive nuclear facilities outside Yongbyon as well as its missile and warheads program.</p>\n<p>Experts have said Washington shouldn&rsquo;t give up too much for a Yongbyon-only deal as the North is believed to be secretly operating other uranium enrichment sites hidden around the country.</p>\n<p>Trump says that the summit ended on a good note but that there are no current plans for a third summit.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>3 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump says he doesn&rsquo;t think North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was involved in the mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died after being detained in the isolated country.</p>\n<p>Trump says of Kim: &ldquo;He tells me that he didn&rsquo;t know about it, and I will take him at his word.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump has taken credit for freeing American prisoners abroad and used Warmbier&rsquo;s death as a rallying cry against the North&rsquo;s human rights abuses before softening his rhetoric in advance of talks with Kim.</p>\n<p>Warmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student from Ohio, was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>2:55 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump won&rsquo;t commit to saying the U.S. is demanding complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea before removing sanctions on that country.</p>\n<p>Trump spoke Thursday at a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, after he announced that he had walked away from his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without a deal being reached.</p>\n<p>Trump says: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put myself in that position from the standpoint of negotiation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump and other U.S. officials have long maintained that denuclearization was a prerequisite to lifting sanctions on North Korea. Trump said earlier that U.S. sanctions were the sticking point in the talks with Kim.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>2:50 p.m.</p>\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump says he has not committed to a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after their second summit ended early without a deal.</p>\n<p>Trump told reporters at a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday at the end of two days of talks that &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see if it happens,&rdquo; but that he has &ldquo;not committed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As for any further meetings, Trump says, &ldquo;It might be soon. It might not be for a long time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump took questions from reporters after talks with Kim ended early. Trump says that Kim asked the U.S. to lift sanctions in exchange for certain steps toward denuclearization. Trump says he refused.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>2:25 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump is explaining the abrupt and early end to his Vietnamese summit with North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un by telling reporters: &ldquo;Sometimes you have to walk.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump said Thursday that North Korea wanted him to lift U.S. sanctions on the country in exchange for denuclearization, but he wasn&rsquo;t willing to do that.</p>\n<p>Still, he says Kim assured him he&rsquo;ll continue to hold off on nuclear and missile tests.</p>\n<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday at the news conference in Hanoi that he wishes the two sides could have gotten further.</p>\n<p>He says they asked Kim to do more and &ldquo;he was unprepared to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>1:40 p.m.</p>\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un have failed to reach an agreement at their second summit in Vietnam, but talks between the two nations will continue in the future.</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the two leaders discussed denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. She adds: &ldquo;No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Still, Sanders is describing the meetings between Trump and Kim as &ldquo;very good and constructive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump and Kim departed the hotel where they&rsquo;ve been holding summit negotiations far earlier than planned Thursday. A joint agreement signing ceremony was scrapped.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>1:25 p.m.</p>\n<p>President Donald Trump and North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un have departed the hotel where they&rsquo;ve been holding summit negotiations far earlier than planned.</p>\n<p>The leaders had been expected to hold a working lunch as well as attend a joint agreement signing ceremony at the Hanoi Metropole hotel on Thursday. Instead, they departed in separate motorcades within minutes of each other after doing neither.</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters before Trump departed that there had been a &ldquo;program change,&rdquo; but she did not provide further explanation about what had prompted the upheaval or whether any deals had been agreed to.</p>\n<p>Trump is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2 p.m. &mdash; two hours earlier than originally scheduled &mdash; before he departs Hanoi.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>12:55 p.m.</p>\n<p>Talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un are wrapping up earlier than expected.</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday that &ldquo;negotiations are still ongoing&rdquo; between the two delegations. Trump and Kim were scheduled to have lunch but did not enter the dining room where reporters were assembled.</p>\n<p>Sanders says Trump will return with his delegation to his hotel soon, providing no updates on a scheduled joint signing with Kim that had been on the books for 2 p.m.</p>\n<p>Sanders says Trump&rsquo;s press conference, which had been scheduled for 4 p.m., has now been moved to 2 p.m. at his hotel.</p>\n<p>___</p>\n<p>12:50 p.m.</p>\n<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in expects to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on the phone following Trump&rsquo;s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the future of the North&rsquo;s nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Moon said Thursday that the call could take place shortly before Trump departs Vietnam or when he&rsquo;s aboard the presidential plane.</p>\n<p>Moon is desperate for a breakthrough in nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang so he can continue to push engagement with North Korea.

                "text": "HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (all times local):\n12:45 a.m. Friday\nNorth Korea is disputing President Donald Trump\u2019s account of why the summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (kim jawng oon) collapsed.\nNorth Korea\u2019s foreign minister says the North demanded only partial sanctions relief in exchange for shuttering its main nuclear complex, and that the discussions collapsed after the U.S. demanded further disarmament steps.\nRi Yong Ho\u2019s comments during an abruptly scheduled news conference in Hanoi on Friday contradicted the explanation by Trump, who hours earlier told reporters that the North had demanded a full removal of sanctions in exchange for shuttering the Yongbyon nuclear facility.\nRi says the North was also ready to offer in writing a permanent halt of the country\u2019s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and that Washington wasted an opportunity that \u201cmay not come again.\u201d\nHe says the North\u2019s position wouldn\u2019t change even if the United States offers to resume another round of dialogue.\n__\n8:20 p.m.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says nuclear negotiations with North Korea will resume quickly following the collapse of President Donald Trump\u2019s summit with Kim Jong Un (kim jawng oon).\nPompeo said progress was made between Trump and Kim at their talks in Hanoi but not enough to warrant signing any kind of agreement. The White House had scheduled a signing ceremony but abruptly canceled it along with a lunch when it became clear an agreement could not be reached.\nPompeo spoke as he flew to Manila from Hanoi, Vietnam, for talks with senior Philippines officials.\n__\n6:35 p.m.\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office says U.S. President Donald Trump regretted the collapse of his nuclear summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam but expressed \u201cfirm\u201d commitment to continue negotiations.\nThe office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Thursday that Trump in a phone conversation with Moon discussed the details of his talks with Kim as he flew out of Vietnam.\nThe Blue House says Moon encouraged Trump to continue his efforts for accomplishing the \u201chistoric feat of resolving the world\u2019s last remaining Cold War rivalry.\u201d It says the leaders agreed to meet soon to discuss the nuclear issue.\nTrump says he \u201cwalked away\u201d from talks with Kim after it was clear the two sides remained at odds over ending the North\u2019s nuclear program.\nKim was asked whether he was ready to denuclearize and said, \u201cIf I\u2019m not willing to do that I won\u2019t be here right now.\u201d\n___\n5:10 p.m.\nThe Kremlin says that talks at the U.S.-North Korean nuclear summit in Vietnam appear to have failed because the parties proved unwilling to compromise and make concessions.\nTalks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wrapped up two hours earlier on Thursday after the parties failed to reach an agreement. Trump says the U.S. was unwilling to meet North Korea\u2019s demand to remove all U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of a North Korean nuclear facility.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow is encouraged by the fact the negotiations did not break down completely. But Peskov laments the lack of \u201csmall steps\u201d and flexibility that could have helped to achieve some progress.\nPeskov says the North Korean nuclear program is a complicated issue that is \u201cimpossible to solve in one go.\u201d\n___\n4:55 p.m.\nChina says the U.S. and North Korea must \u201cmeet each other halfway\u201d after no agreement was reached between the two countries\u2019 leaders during their nuclear summit in Vietnam.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said during a regular news briefing Thursday that the situation in the Korean Peninsula experienced a significant \u201cturnaround\u201d over the past year, a \u201chard-won result\u201d that is worth cherishing.\nLu says the U.S. and North Korea have returned to the correct path toward a political settlement, which is \u201cthe only way out.\u201d\nDuring his post-summit press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump called Chinese leader Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) \u201ca highly-respected leader all over the world\u201d who has been \u201cvery helpful\u201d with North Korea. Trump says China is highly influential because of its high volume of trade with North Korea.\n___\n4:30 p.m.\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office says it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to produce an agreement in their high-stakes nuclear summit in Vietnam. But it says it expects \u201cactive dialogue\u201d to continue between Washington and Pyongyang.\nThe Blue House said Thursday it believes Washington and Pyongyang deepened their understandings of each other during their \u201clong and deep discussions\u201d in Hanoi.\nIt says Trump raising the possibility of sanctions relief in exchange for nuclear disarmament steps from the North shows that the nuclear negotiations between the countries have entered an \u201celevated level.\u201d\nThe collapse of the Trump-Kim summit could prove to be a setback for South Korean President Moon Jae-in, whose ambitions for inter-Korean engagement hinge on a nuclear breakthrough between Washington and Pyongyang.\n___\n3:50 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump has departed Vietnam after failing to reach an agreement during his second nuclear summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un.\nThe U.S. leader said he \u201cwalked away\u201d from talks with Kim after it was clear the two sides remained at odds in talks over ending the North\u2019s nuclear program.\nTrump says the North had demanded a full removal of U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of the North\u2019s Yongbyon nuclear facility, and the U.S. wouldn\u2019t agree to that.\nTrump took off from Hanoi more than two hours early after the abrupt change in schedule. Air Force One is scheduled to refuel in Anchorage, Alaska, before returning to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington late Thursday.\n___\n3:40 p.m.\nSouth Korean media are reacting with alarm over the collapse of the nuclear summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nYonhap news agency said Thursday that the clock on the security situation of the Korean Peninsula has \u201cturned back to zero\u201d and that the diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff with the North was now \u201cat a crossroads.\u201d\nFinancial News wondered whether Washington and Pyongyang would struggle to keep the momentum of dialogue alive and anticipated the nuclear negotiations becoming a prolonged battle.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who met with Kim three times last year and lobbied hard to revive nuclear diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang, was expected to comment on the outcome of the Trump-Kim summit later Thursday.\n___\n3:25 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump is hopeful that India and Pakistan may be on the cusp of progress after the two countries exchanged gunfire through the night along the Kashmir region a day after Islamabad said it shot down two Indian warplanes and captured a pilot.\nTrump told reporters Thursday at the end of a two-day summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam that India and Pakistan have \u201cbeen going at it\u201d and that the U.S. has been involved, \u201ctrying to help them both out\u201d to \u201csee if we can get some organization and some peace.\u201d\nHe says: \u201cI think probably that\u2019s going to be happening,\u201d adding: \u201cWe have, I think, reasonably attractive news from Pakistan and India.\u201d\nWorld powers have called on the two nations to de-escalate tensions that have gripped the region since a Feb. 14 suicide car bombing killed over 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. The situation escalated with Wednesday\u2019s aerial skirmish.\n___\n3:05 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un fell through after the North demanded a full removal of U.S.-led international sanctions in exchange for the shuttering of the North\u2019s Yongbyon nuclear facility.\nTrump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Vietnam on Thursday that the United States wasn\u2019t willing to make a deal without the North committing to giving up its secretive nuclear facilities outside Yongbyon as well as its missile and warheads program.\nExperts have said Washington shouldn\u2019t give up too much for a Yongbyon-only deal as the North is believed to be secretly operating other uranium enrichment sites hidden around the country.\nTrump says that the summit ended on a good note but that there are no current plans for a third summit.\n___\n3 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says he doesn\u2019t think North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was involved in the mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died after being detained in the isolated country.\nTrump says of Kim: \u201cHe tells me that he didn\u2019t know about it, and I will take him at his word.\u201d\nTrump has taken credit for freeing American prisoners abroad and used Warmbier\u2019s death as a rallying cry against the North\u2019s human rights abuses before softening his rhetoric in advance of talks with Kim.\nWarmbier, a 22-year-old University of Virginia student from Ohio, was visiting North Korea with a tour group when he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in 2016 on suspicion of stealing a propaganda poster. He died in June 2017, shortly after he returned to the U.S. in a coma.\n___\n2:55 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump won\u2019t commit to saying the U.S. is demanding complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea before removing sanctions on that country.\nTrump spoke Thursday at a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, after he announced that he had walked away from his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un without a deal being reached.\nTrump says: \u201cI don\u2019t want to put myself in that position from the standpoint of negotiation.\u201d\nTrump and other U.S. officials have long maintained that denuclearization was a prerequisite to lifting sanctions on North Korea. Trump said earlier that U.S. sanctions were the sticking point in the talks with Kim.\n___\n2:50 p.m.\nU.S. President Donald Trump says he has not committed to a third summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after their second summit ended early without a deal.\nTrump told reporters at a news conference in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday at the end of two days of talks that \u201cwe\u2019ll see if it happens,\u201d but that he has \u201cnot committed.\u201d\nAs for any further meetings, Trump says, \u201cIt might be soon. It might not be for a long time.\u201d\nTrump took questions from reporters after talks with Kim ended early. Trump says that Kim asked the U.S. to lift sanctions in exchange for certain steps toward denuclearization. Trump says he refused.\n___\n2:25 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump is explaining the abrupt and early end to his Vietnamese summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un by telling reporters: \u201cSometimes you have to walk.\u201d\nTrump said Thursday that North Korea wanted him to lift U.S. sanctions on the country in exchange for denuclearization, but he wasn\u2019t willing to do that.\nStill, he says Kim assured him he\u2019ll continue to hold off on nuclear and missile tests.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday at the news conference in Hanoi that he wishes the two sides could have gotten further.\nHe says they asked Kim to do more and \u201che was unprepared to do that.\u201d\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un have failed to reach an agreement at their second summit in Vietnam, but talks between the two nations will continue in the future.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders says the two leaders discussed denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. She adds: \u201cNo agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future.\u201d\nStill, Sanders is describing the meetings between Trump and Kim as \u201cvery good and constructive.\u201d\nTrump and Kim departed the hotel where they\u2019ve been holding summit negotiations far earlier than planned Thursday. A joint agreement signing ceremony was scrapped.\n___\n1:25 p.m.\nPresident Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un have departed the hotel where they\u2019ve been holding summit negotiations far earlier than planned.\nThe leaders had been expected to hold a working lunch as well as attend a joint agreement signing ceremony at the Hanoi Metropole hotel on Thursday. Instead, they departed in separate motorcades within minutes of each other after doing neither.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters before Trump departed that there had been a \u201cprogram change,\u201d but she did not provide further explanation about what had prompted the upheaval or whether any deals had been agreed to.\nTrump is scheduled to hold a news conference at 2 p.m. \u2014 two hours earlier than originally scheduled \u2014 before he departs Hanoi.\n___\n12:55 p.m.\nTalks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un are wrapping up earlier than expected.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Thursday that \u201cnegotiations are still ongoing\u201d between the two delegations. Trump and Kim were scheduled to have lunch but did not enter the dining room where reporters were assembled.\nSanders says Trump will return with his delegation to his hotel soon, providing no updates on a scheduled joint signing with Kim that had been on the books for 2 p.m.\nSanders says Trump\u2019s press conference, which had been scheduled for 4 p.m., has now been moved to 2 p.m. at his hotel.\n___\n12:50 p.m.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in expects to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump on the phone following Trump\u2019s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over the future of the North\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\nA spokesman for Moon said Thursday that the call could take place shortly before Trump departs Vietnam or when he\u2019s aboard the presidential plane.\nMoon is desperate for a breakthrough in nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang so he can continue to push engagement with North Korea. Moon recently told Trump in a phone conversation that the South was ready to proceed with inter-Korean economic projects to induce further nuclear disarmament steps from the North.\n___\nNoon\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in plans to offer new proposals for inter-Korean engagement following the high-stakes nuclear summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nMoon\u2019s announcement is planned for a Friday ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of a 1919 uprising by Koreans against Japan\u2019s colonial rule and will likely include plans for economic cooperation between the rival Koreas.\nMoon is desperate for a breakthrough in nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang so he can continue engagement with North Korea. He has driven the three-way diplomacy but is now held back by tough U.S.-led sanctions against the North.\nKim and Trump are meeting Thursday in Vietnam as they inch closer toward establishing formal ties.\n___\n11:25 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says it\u2019s \u201ca good idea\u201d for the U.S. to open a liaison office in North Korea, as Kim Jong Un calls the notion \u201cwelcomable.\u201d\nIn an unprecedented question-and-answer session with reporters Thursday in Vietnam, the two leaders of the technically-warring countries inched closer toward establishing formal ties.\nAsked by an American reporter if he was willing to allow the U.S. to open an office in Pyongyang, Kim said through a translator, \u201cI think that is something which is welcomable.\u201d\nTrump says that he considers it \u201ca good idea,\u201d adding that it should happen \u201cboth ways.\u201d\nEarlier Thursday, Kim said he wouldn\u2019t be holding a summit with Trump if he weren\u2019t willing to make good on his denuclearization pledge.",

With an average of 80% of sample polling stations counted, the five survey organizations showed Widodo winning 54-56% of the vote, a modest improvement on his 2014 showing.</p>\n<p>Indonesia, the world&rsquo;s most populous Muslim-majority nation, is an outpost of democracy in a Southeast Asian neighborhood of authoritarian governments and is forecast to be among the world&rsquo;s biggest economies by 2030. A second term for Widodo, the first Indonesian president from outside the Jakarta elite, could further cement the country&rsquo;s two decades of democratization.</p>\n<p>Addressing jubilant supporters a few hours after polls closed, Widodo said he was aware of his lead and called for the nation to reunite after the divisions of the campaign.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From the indications of the exit poll and also the quick counts, we can see it all, but we must be patient to wait for the official counting from the Election Commission,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Subianto, who also lost to Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, had not yet conceded defeat. He said his campaign&rsquo;s exit poll and quick count showed that he had won but urged his supporters not to cause chaos.</p>\n<p>His campaign team has alleged massive voter list irregularities, but analysts say the claims are absurd and designed to undermine the election.</p>\n<p>The balloting was a huge logistical exercise with 193 million people eligible to vote, more than 800,000 polling stations and 17 million people involved in ensuring the polls ran smoothly. Helicopters, boats and horses were used to get ballots to remote and inaccessible corners of the archipelago.</p>\n<p>Conservative opponents had tried to discredit Widodo, a furniture exporter whose political career started as a small city mayor, as insufficiently Islamic.</p>\n<p>Widodo tried to neutralize the not-a-real-Muslim whispers with the selection of Ma&rsquo;ruf Amin, the leading Islamic cleric in Indonesia, as his running mate, though he risked alienating progressive and moderate supporters.</p>\n<p>Pre-election polls consistently gave a lead of as much as 20 percentage points to Widodo, widely known by the nickname &ldquo;Jokowi.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve voted for Jokowi because five years in office was not enough for him to complete his brilliant programs for infrastructure, health and education,&rdquo; said Eko Cahya Pratama, 43, after voting in Tangerang on the outskirts of Jakarta.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For me, this country is better to be managed by a man with a clean track record rather than a dirty one in the past,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>After the results became clear, hundreds of Widodo supporters marched through downtown Jakarta, some holding aloft a giant red and white Indonesian flag.</p>\n<p>Widodo&rsquo;s campaign highlighted his progress in poverty reduction and improving Indonesia&rsquo;s inadequate infrastructure with new ports, toll roads, airports and mass rapid transit. The latter became a reality last month in chronically congested Jakarta with the opening of a subway.</p>\n<p>A strident nationalist, Subianto ran a fear-based campaign, highlighting what he sees as Indonesia&rsquo;s weakness and the risk of exploitation by foreign powers or disintegration.</p>\n<p>His ultra-nationalist tactics preceded President Donald Trump&rsquo;s polarizing rhetoric by several years and the party he founded in 2008, Gerinda, is officially known as the Greater Indonesia Movement. He has long been dogged by his dismissal from the military in 1998 after soldiers under his command kidnapped student activists, 13 of whom were never seen again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I promised that we will work for the good of the country,&rdquo; Subianto said after voting. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s chaos or not, it&rsquo;s not coming from us. But I guarantee that we don&rsquo;t want to be cheated anymore, that Indonesian people don&rsquo;t want to be cheated anymore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Economic growth in Indonesia has been stable if unspectacular and inflation is low, maximizing the impact of poverty alleviation programs.</p>\n<p>The U.N.&rsquo;s Food and Agriculture Organization and other international agencies said earlier this month that the percentage of Indonesian children suffering from stunting &mdash; malnutrition that can result in lifelong physical and cognitive impairment &mdash; fell to 30.8% from nearly 38% between 2013 and 2018.</p>",

                "html": "<p>TOKYO (AP) &mdash; The wife of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan and Renault, said Wednesday she is worried whether her husband, detained in Japan on financial misconduct allegations, will receive a fair trial, and expressed outrage over a justice system that dragged him back into custody.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This has been a nightmare. We&rsquo;re devastated, our lives turned upside down. And we see no end in sight. For him to be rearrested, and he is on bail, that&rsquo;s something unheard of. I&rsquo;m shocked,&rdquo; Carole Ghosn said in a telephone interview from New York.</p>\n<p>Carlos Ghosn, who led Nissan Motor Co. for 20 years, rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy, was arrested in November and released on bail last month, but was arrested again on April 4.</p>\n<p>His wife recalled the scene of his rearrest earlier this month, saying 20 prosecutors came into their Tokyo apartment at 5:50 a.m., when she was still in her pajamas, and seized her cellphone, passport and documents that defense lawyers had been preparing for the trial.</p>\n<p>Although such seizures might lead to a mistrial in the U.S., prosecutors are allowed such actions in Japan, legal experts say. Early morning arrests and raids are routine in Japan.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are concerned about a fair trial,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They now know what we were planning as a defense, what evidence we have.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He has been charged with falsifying financial documents in under-reporting his retirement compensation and with breach of trust in dubious payments. He says he&rsquo;s innocent, noting the compensation was never decided and saying the payments were legitimate.</p>\n<p>In a video prepared before his latest arrest, he accused some executives at Nissan of plotting against him over what he called selfish fears they had about his leadership and Nissan merging with French alliance partner Renault SA.</p>\n<p>Nissan has said an internal investigation found wrongdoing, ousted Ghosn from its board and promised to fix faulty governance.</p>\n<p>Ghosn&rsquo;s detention has been approved through April 22, but that can be extended further. Prosecutors say the latest breach of trust allegations are new, and there is risk evidence may be destroyed.</p>\n<p>Carole Ghosn said she will return to Japan when her husband is released on bail.</p>\n<p>She said the conditions of her husband&rsquo;s detention are harsh, using a term that refers to long detentions without convictions in Japan, &ldquo;hostage justice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Like others who undergo detention in Japan, Ghosn is in solitary confinement, and is interrogated by prosecutors all day. He gets fresh air a half hour each day, but is not allowed outdoors over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Carole Ghosn said she was worried about his health because he has been weakened by the long detention and is not getting enough sunlight.</p>\n<p>She was also recently questioned in a Japanese court. She declined to give details, but said there was little substance to the questioning.

                "text": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 The wife of Carlos Ghosn, the former chairman of Nissan and Renault, said Wednesday she is worried whether her husband, detained in Japan on financial misconduct allegations, will receive a fair trial, and expressed outrage over a justice system that dragged him back into custody.\n\u201cThis has been a nightmare. We\u2019re devastated, our lives turned upside down. And we see no end in sight. For him to be rearrested, and he is on bail, that\u2019s something unheard of. I\u2019m shocked,\u201d Carole Ghosn said in a telephone interview from New York.\nCarlos Ghosn, who led Nissan Motor Co. for 20 years, rescuing it from the brink of bankruptcy, was arrested in November and released on bail last month, but was arrested again on April 4.\nHis wife recalled the scene of his rearrest earlier this month, saying 20 prosecutors came into their Tokyo apartment at 5:50 a.m., when she was still in her pajamas, and seized her cellphone, passport and documents that defense lawyers had been preparing for the trial.\nAlthough such seizures might lead to a mistrial in the U.S., prosecutors are allowed such actions in Japan, legal experts say. Early morning arrests and raids are routine in Japan.\n\u201cWe are concerned about a fair trial,\u201d she said. \u201cThey now know what we were planning as a defense, what evidence we have.\u201d\nHe has been charged with falsifying financial documents in under-reporting his retirement compensation and with breach of trust in dubious payments. He says he\u2019s innocent, noting the compensation was never decided and saying the payments were legitimate.\nIn a video prepared before his latest arrest, he accused some executives at Nissan of plotting against him over what he called selfish fears they had about his leadership and Nissan merging with French alliance partner Renault SA.\nNissan has said an internal investigation found wrongdoing, ousted Ghosn from its board and promised to fix faulty governance.\nGhosn\u2019s detention has been approved through April 22, but that can be extended further. Prosecutors say the latest breach of trust allegations are new, and there is risk evidence may be destroyed.\nCarole Ghosn said she will return to Japan when her husband is released on bail.\nShe said the conditions of her husband\u2019s detention are harsh, using a term that refers to long detentions without convictions in Japan, \u201chostage justice.\u201d\nLike others who undergo detention in Japan, Ghosn is in solitary confinement, and is interrogated by prosecutors all day. He gets fresh air a half hour each day, but is not allowed outdoors over the weekend.\nCarole Ghosn said she was worried about his health because he has been weakened by the long detention and is not getting enough sunlight.\nShe was also recently questioned in a Japanese court. She declined to give details, but said there was little substance to the questioning. She is not a suspect but agreed to be questioned voluntarily.\nShe stressed that her husband is ready for a fight, and said she was proud of him.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re put in a situation that is so unfair, it eats you up and you want to fight every moment that you can because he knows how unjust it is, and he knows he\u2019s been stabbed in the back,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnyone who is put in an unfair situation, you want to fight for your rights. You want to fight for your innocence. You want to fight to clear your name.\u201d\n___",

Yesterday, people could ignore the president as Trump just being Trump. Today, that is no longer the case.</p>\n<p>Chair of the House Intelligence committee Representative Adam Schiff (D-NY) helped the country open its eyes to the dysfunctional severity of Trump running this great land. Cohen testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about POTUS and Russia behind closed doors. Then, Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee and the U.S. people. His next testimony was scheduled with Schiff, again behind closed doors and on the man currently sitting in the Oval Office&rsquo;s relationship with Russia.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8LSJ6_Rzjs?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The Intelligence committee chair raised the shade of Trump&rsquo;s presidency onto a stark window of reality. He said that if Cohen&rsquo;s testimony was accurate, Trump &ldquo;literally committed crimes in the Oval Office.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>CNN&rsquo;s Alysin Camerota interviewed Schiff about Cohen&rsquo;s testimony. She asked &ldquo;how do you assess where the investigations are today:&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;So, congressman, where are we? Just give us from where you sit, because you have been so steeped in this. Where are we today? But these 20 pages are really in a different category of what is about to be revealed under oath to Congress and so, from where you sit, has the needle been moved? How do you assess where the investigations are today?&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uqbaAYq-bMc?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Schiff replied that should Cohen&rsquo;s testimony be accurate, Trump &ldquo;engaged in criminal activity&rdquo; in the Oval Office:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;Well the needle has certainly been moved, and it&rsquo;s been moved into the White House If Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s allegations are correct, it means the president, while in office, literally while in the Oval Office was engaged in criminal activity, and that is furthering this campaign fraud scheme. So, that&rsquo;s pretty breath-taking when you think about it, that the president of the United States is allegedly paying hush money as President of the United States, and misleading the country about it. And that&rsquo;s pretty serious business.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1PJP9vYCahA?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "The nation has moved in history as a result of Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony. Yesterday, people could ignore the president as Trump just being Trump. Today, that is no longer the case.\nChair of the House Intelligence committee Representative Adam Schiff (D-NY) helped the country open its eyes to the dysfunctional severity of Trump running this great land. Cohen testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee about POTUS and Russia behind closed doors. Then, Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee and the U.S. people. His next testimony was scheduled with Schiff, again behind closed doors and on the man currently sitting in the Oval Office\u2019s relationship with Russia.\nThe Intelligence committee chair raised the shade of Trump\u2019s presidency onto a stark window of reality. He said that if Cohen\u2019s testimony was accurate, Trump \u201cliterally committed crimes in the Oval Office.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Alysin Camerota interviewed Schiff about Cohen\u2019s testimony. She asked \u201chow do you assess where the investigations are today:\u201d\n\u2018So, congressman, where are we? Just give us from where you sit, because you have been so steeped in this. Where are we today? But these 20 pages are really in a different category of what is about to be revealed under oath to Congress and so, from where you sit, has the needle been moved? How do you assess where the investigations are today?\u2019\nSchiff replied that should Cohen\u2019s testimony be accurate, Trump \u201cengaged in criminal activity\u201d in the Oval Office:\n\u2018Well the needle has certainly been moved, and it\u2019s been moved into the White House If Mr. Cohen\u2019s allegations are correct, it means the president, while in office, literally while in the Oval Office was engaged in criminal activity, and that is furthering this campaign fraud scheme. So, that\u2019s pretty breath-taking when you think about it, that the president of the United States is allegedly paying hush money as President of the United States, and misleading the country about it. And that\u2019s pretty serious business.\u2019",

                "html": "<p>Tension over Donald Trump&rsquo;s presidency exploded out into the open yet again this week with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen&rsquo;s public appearance before the House Oversight Committee. The hearing quickly devolved into a partisan flame war in which Republicans desperately wielded as many tools as possible &mdash; including a token black person who says Trump isn&rsquo;t racist after all. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) slammed this move, decrying the patronizing of black Americans that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) having Lynne Patton as his guest at the hearing represented.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8wBdzZaODQ?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>She asserted:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, being a black person, I can only imagine what is being said in private. To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is totally insulting, and in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive, to look at the administration speaks volumes.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\"> <p>WOW &mdash; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepLawrence?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RepLawrence</a> *goes in* on Mark Meadows for citing one black Trump administration official to argue Trump can&rsquo;t be racist.</p> <p>&ldquo;To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies [racist statements] is insulting,&rdquo; she says. <a href=\"https://t.co/6HcVYKx1NT\">pic.twitter.com/6HcVYKx1NT</a></p> <p>&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1100838480761028613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed &mdash; just in his public commentary, Trump has perpetuated the anti-immigrant and anti-minority rhetoric that has so often been used to target black Americans. He has sounded an alarm about the supposedly negatively transforming power of immigration, and he has sought to tamper down concerns from those minority community members who do make it to the U.S. about their treatment.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JMnfmxA_Qo?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Trying to counter what we can all see and hear, Meadows brought Patton as his surprise guest to the Oversight Committee hearing at which Cohen appeared this Wednesday. She used to be friends with the now former lawyer, and went from working at the Eric Trump Foundation to working in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>\n<p>Although not in the hearing itself, Patton explicitly claimed recently that President Trump is not a racist. During the Wednesday hearing, Meadows pointed to her status as the child of someone from the historically racism-jostled city Birmingham, Alabama, as evidence that she&rsquo;d never work for someone who was racist.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wS-5mTfzbxI?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>In other words &mdash; the argument is that because one black person tolerates Trump and apparently gets at least the same treatment in return, we should take this single case as a rule instead of an exception, according to Meadows, who thereby engaged in a cliched and long-questionable at best argument against Trump&rsquo;s racism. Cohen had explicitly called Trump a racist in his opening statement and countered Meadows by asserting that there are zero black &ldquo;executives&rdquo; at the Trump Organization.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8LSJ6_Rzjs?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Again, despite Meadows&rsquo; dismissal of concerns about Trump&rsquo;s racism, on a very real level outside of his more salacious moments, the president has demonstrated his fondness for singling out minorities because of their race. He has claimed <em>without any evidence</em> that there are vast, unreported criminal networks among undocumented immigrants, defining this elusive underworld by the targets&rsquo; race, and more specifically, by the fact that they&rsquo;re not white.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSO8AZMBIC0?start=18&feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>And Meadows wants us to no longer be concerned about that because he got one statement from one black woman saying Trump isn&rsquo;t a racist? Seriously? Is he even aware of how outlandish his suggestion is? Does he care?</p>\n<p>Featured Image via Screenshot from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1100838480761028613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1100838480761028613&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fhouse%2F431866-dem-blasts-meadows-for-bringing-black-trump-official-to-challenge-racism\">the video</a></p>",

                "text": "Tension over Donald Trump\u2019s presidency exploded out into the open yet again this week with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s public appearance before the House Oversight Committee. The hearing quickly devolved into a partisan flame war in which Republicans desperately wielded as many tools as possible \u2014 including a token black person who says Trump isn\u2019t racist after all. Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) slammed this move, decrying the patronizing of black Americans that Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) having Lynne Patton as his guest at the hearing represented.\nShe asserted:\n\u2018Having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, being a black person, I can only imagine what is being said in private. To prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies that is totally insulting, and in this environment of expecting a president to be inclusive, to look at the administration speaks volumes.\u2019\nWOW \u2014 @RepLawrence *goes in* on Mark Meadows for citing one black Trump administration official to argue Trump can\u2019t be racist.\n\u201cTo prop up one member of our entire race of black people and say that that nullifies [racist statements] is insulting,\u201d she says. pic.twitter.com/6HcVYKx1NT\n\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 27, 2019\nIndeed \u2014 just in his public commentary, Trump has perpetuated the anti-immigrant and anti-minority rhetoric that has so often been used to target black Americans. He has sounded an alarm about the supposedly negatively transforming power of immigration, and he has sought to tamper down concerns from those minority community members who do make it to the U.S. about their treatment.\nTrying to counter what we can all see and hear, Meadows brought Patton as his surprise guest to the Oversight Committee hearing at which Cohen appeared this Wednesday. She used to be friends with the now former lawyer, and went from working at the Eric Trump Foundation to working in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nAlthough not in the hearing itself, Patton explicitly claimed recently that President Trump is not a racist. During the Wednesday hearing, Meadows pointed to her status as the child of someone from the historically racism-jostled city Birmingham, Alabama, as evidence that she\u2019d never work for someone who was racist.\nIn other words \u2014 the argument is that because one black person tolerates Trump and apparently gets at least the same treatment in return, we should take this single case as a rule instead of an exception, according to Meadows, who thereby engaged in a cliched and long-questionable at best argument against Trump\u2019s racism. Cohen had explicitly called Trump a racist in his opening statement and countered Meadows by asserting that there are zero black \u201cexecutives\u201d at the Trump Organization.\nAgain, despite Meadows\u2019 dismissal of concerns about Trump\u2019s racism, on a very real level outside of his more salacious moments, the president has demonstrated his fondness for singling out minorities because of their race. He has claimed without any evidence that there are vast, unreported criminal networks among undocumented immigrants, defining this elusive underworld by the targets\u2019 race, and more specifically, by the fact that they\u2019re not white.\nAnd Meadows wants us to no longer be concerned about that because he got one statement from one black woman saying Trump isn\u2019t a racist? Seriously? Is he even aware of how outlandish his suggestion is? Does he care?\nFeatured Image via Screenshot from the video",

                "html": "<p>Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen&rsquo;s public Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight Committee has quickly proven contentious. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are simply steamrolling the testimony through in a partisan effort to undercut the GOP and President Donald Trump &mdash; and Massachusetts Democrat Stephen Lynch is among those who aren&rsquo;t remotely interested in putting up with that argument.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8LSJ6_Rzjs?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>After Georgia Republican Jody Hice complained that Cohen&rsquo;s appearance constituted the committee &ldquo;losing our credibility&rdquo; and a &ldquo;shameful mockery of what our purpose is,&rdquo; Lynch walked through a list of the many former Trump associates who&rsquo;ve pleaded guilty to federal crimes as part of the Russia investigation and passionately asserted:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You want to talk about a low point?.. For two years &mdash; you want to talk about an agenda! &mdash; my friends on the other side of the aisle refused to bring any of these people up before the committee!&hellip; Your side ran away from the truth, and we are trying to bring it to the American people.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Watch below.</p>\n<blockquote data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\"> <p>After Hice claims that Dems just want to bring down Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepLynch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RepLynch</a> says, &ldquo;for 2 years, my friends on the other side of the aisle refused to bring anyone up before the committee&hellip; Your side ran away from the truth. We are trying to bring it to the American people.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://t.co/nPSL90BBP1\">pic.twitter.com/nPSL90BBP1</a></p> <p>&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1100802477262364677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s appearances before Congress this week run in part, as Lynch suggested, on his stake in the long-running Russia scandal. He&rsquo;s soon going to jail for three years in part because of lying to Congress about the scope of efforts to construct a Trump Tower in Moscow.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SI9Nsyq4jKA?start=99&feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Since then, he&rsquo;s abandoned the president&rsquo;s side and asserted that he now intends to let Congress and the American people know what really happened behind the scenes during his time with Donald Trump.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSLC94o5XFo?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Republicans have worked to keep that from happening, but their powers are limited since they&rsquo;re not in the majority in the House. Still, at the very beginning of Cohen&rsquo;s Wednesday appearance, GOP Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan attempted to pressure Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) into postponing the hearing because Cohen had supposedly stuck it to the the GOP minority in submitting his opening statement hours after it would be traditionally required. The implication was that Republicans didn&rsquo;t have enough time to prepare.</p>\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s not a secret what the committee&rsquo;s party breakdown is, the GOP sought a recorded vote on their motion to postpone the hearing anyway, which failed.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JPYbPgb_TU?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Before those involved ever even gathered for the hearing, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz attempted his own method of getting the testimony shut down, intimidating Cohen with claims of infidelity which he had absolutely no apparent evidence for. The situation is similar to when the Trump team suggested that Cohen&rsquo;s father-in-law is connected to organized crime, again with absolutely no apparent evidence.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G1IQ4HeQ-y0?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Once the hearing actually got underway, Republicans again kept on with their intimidation efforts. Jordan, for instance, attempted to insist that Cohen actually has no remorse for his past wrongdoing and therefore shouldn&rsquo;t be trusted now, and the former Trump fixer promptly shut him down, insisting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Shame on you, Mr. Jordan.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n<p>When they again spoke later in the hearing, Cohen aptly noted that it was &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; that not a single Republican had at that point asked him a question about President Trump, with the party remaining seemingly forever intent on keeping the truth about him from being scrutinized for too long.</p>\n<p>Featured Image via Screenshot from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1100802477262364677\">the video</a></p>",

                "text": "Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s public Wednesday appearance before the House Oversight Committee has quickly proven contentious. Republicans have claimed that Democrats are simply steamrolling the testimony through in a partisan effort to undercut the GOP and President Donald Trump \u2014 and Massachusetts Democrat Stephen Lynch is among those who aren\u2019t remotely interested in putting up with that argument.\nAfter Georgia Republican Jody Hice complained that Cohen\u2019s appearance constituted the committee \u201closing our credibility\u201d and a \u201cshameful mockery of what our purpose is,\u201d Lynch walked through a list of the many former Trump associates who\u2019ve pleaded guilty to federal crimes as part of the Russia investigation and passionately asserted:\n\u2018You want to talk about a low point?.. For two years \u2014 you want to talk about an agenda! \u2014 my friends on the other side of the aisle refused to bring any of these people up before the committee!\u2026 Your side ran away from the truth, and we are trying to bring it to the American people.\u2019\nWatch below.\nAfter Hice claims that Dems just want to bring down Trump, @RepLynch says, \u201cfor 2 years, my friends on the other side of the aisle refused to bring anyone up before the committee\u2026 Your side ran away from the truth. We are trying to bring it to the American people.\u201d pic.twitter.com/nPSL90BBP1\n\u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) February 27, 2019\nCohen\u2019s appearances before Congress this week run in part, as Lynch suggested, on his stake in the long-running Russia scandal. He\u2019s soon going to jail for three years in part because of lying to Congress about the scope of efforts to construct a Trump Tower in Moscow.\nSince then, he\u2019s abandoned the president\u2019s side and asserted that he now intends to let Congress and the American people know what really happened behind the scenes during his time with Donald Trump.\nRepublicans have worked to keep that from happening, but their powers are limited since they\u2019re not in the majority in the House. Still, at the very beginning of Cohen\u2019s Wednesday appearance, GOP Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan attempted to pressure Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) into postponing the hearing because Cohen had supposedly stuck it to the the GOP minority in submitting his opening statement hours after it would be traditionally required. The implication was that Republicans didn\u2019t have enough time to prepare.\nAlthough it\u2019s not a secret what the committee\u2019s party breakdown is, the GOP sought a recorded vote on their motion to postpone the hearing anyway, which failed.\nBefore those involved ever even gathered for the hearing, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz attempted his own method of getting the testimony shut down, intimidating Cohen with claims of infidelity which he had absolutely no apparent evidence for. The situation is similar to when the Trump team suggested that Cohen\u2019s father-in-law is connected to organized crime, again with absolutely no apparent evidence.\nOnce the hearing actually got underway, Republicans again kept on with their intimidation efforts. Jordan, for instance, attempted to insist that Cohen actually has no remorse for his past wrongdoing and therefore shouldn\u2019t be trusted now, and the former Trump fixer promptly shut him down, insisting:\n\u2018Shame on you, Mr. Jordan.\u2019\nWhen they again spoke later in the hearing, Cohen aptly noted that it was \u201cinteresting\u201d that not a single Republican had at that point asked him a question about President Trump, with the party remaining seemingly forever intent on keeping the truth about him from being scrutinized for too long.\nFeatured Image via Screenshot from the video",

According to his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, those records were as slick as the man who generated them. Cohen&rsquo;s testimony about Trump&rsquo;s money before the House Oversight and Reform committee is riveting.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri5yNT7VxWg?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Representative William Lacy Clay (D-MO) asked Cohen if there were times in his employment with the Trump Organization where CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Allen Weisselberg spoke to the media. To put a finer point on the question, did Weisselberg talk to a <em>Forbes Magazine</em> reporter:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;&hellip;because Mr. Trump wanted each year to have his net worth rise on the <em>Forbes</em> wealthiest individuals list?&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Cohen testified that Trump listed his property assets by the highest price per square foot on other financial records. The president also used the gross rent-roll and multiplied it by a fictitious multiple.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zsSbdaePX-I?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Cohen provided the House Oversight committee with samples of the president&rsquo;s financial statements. Then, he said:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s based upon what he wanted to value the asset at.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Cohen said that Trump had a fluctuating set of financial documents. He would send one set to news outlets, i.e. Forbes Magazine, indicating that the president&rsquo;s net worth was higher. Then for insurance purposes, he would send a set of numbers. That would get Trump lower premiums.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;I believe these numbers are inflated.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Clay then asked Cohen whether POTUS ever sent inflated numbers to banks in order to get a better loan. The former personal attorney said that Trump had given Deutsche Bank higher numbers so that he could buy the Buffalo Bills football team.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/okdhHsx22z4?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Featured image is a screenshot via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okdhHsx22z4\">YouTube.</a></p>",

                "text": "Donald Trump has different sets of revolving financial records to suit his various purposes. According to his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, those records were as slick as the man who generated them. Cohen\u2019s testimony about Trump\u2019s money before the House Oversight and Reform committee is riveting.\nRepresentative William Lacy Clay (D-MO) asked Cohen if there were times in his employment with the Trump Organization where CFO (Chief Financial Officer) Allen Weisselberg spoke to the media. To put a finer point on the question, did Weisselberg talk to a Forbes Magazine reporter:\n\u2018\u2026because Mr. Trump wanted each year to have his net worth rise on the Forbes wealthiest individuals list?\u2019\nCohen testified that Trump listed his property assets by the highest price per square foot on other financial records. The president also used the gross rent-roll and multiplied it by a fictitious multiple.\nCohen provided the House Oversight committee with samples of the president\u2019s financial statements. Then, he said:\n\u2018It\u2019s based upon what he wanted to value the asset at.\u2019\nCohen said that Trump had a fluctuating set of financial documents. He would send one set to news outlets, i.e. Forbes Magazine, indicating that the president\u2019s net worth was higher. Then for insurance purposes, he would send a set of numbers. That would get Trump lower premiums.\n\u2018I believe these numbers are inflated.\u2019\nClay then asked Cohen whether POTUS ever sent inflated numbers to banks in order to get a better loan. The former personal attorney said that Trump had given Deutsche Bank higher numbers so that he could buy the Buffalo Bills football team.\nFeatured image is a screenshot via YouTube.",

Those challengers continue to be proven wrong &mdash; this week, a federal appeals court <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-miller/u-s-court-rejects-challenge-to-special-counsels-appointment-idUSKCN1QF1WN\">dismissed a claim</a> brought by Roger Stone associate Andrew Miller that Mueller&rsquo;s appointment was unconstitutional because he&rsquo;d not appeared before the Senate or been appointed by the president himself.

                "html": "<p>Donald Trump&rsquo;s personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen came across as honest and likable, if flawed in his pubic House hearing testimony. He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in its sights first.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vieYTDPT5Eo?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen&rsquo;s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man was spying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redacted search warrants and related materials that led up to that raid.</p>\n<p>The agents had been interested in Cohen&rsquo;s business interests far earlier than indicated, since July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump&rsquo;s activities. The FBI obtained Cohen&rsquo;s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid.</p>\n<p>Before a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof of specific crimes to convince him or her to sign the warrant.The FBI covered itself by submitting eight different application, affidavits, and search warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list the suspected crimes, and they did, according the <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/avalanche-of-michael-cohen-search-materials-released/\">Courthouse News Service</a>:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;&hellip;the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds of suspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1kgIS2JTrCE?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;The FBI&rsquo;s raid on Cohen&rsquo;s home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s attorney Lanny Davis released a statement the night prior to the search warrants being served on his client. He wrote:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen&rsquo;s links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg.</p>\n<p>Cohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump&rsquo;s television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. The stew just keeps getting thicker and thicker, spicier and spicier.</p>\n<p>Davis claimed that Firtash was an &ldquo;innocent man.&rdquo; However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in &ldquo;an international titanium scheme,&rdquo; the Courthouse News reported.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/05M5dHdmDgk?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Cohen had set up a shell company named Essential Consultants LLC. He had also set up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with the shell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohen said the company was involved in real estate. He lied.</p>\n<p>A FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;Specifically, the account was not intended to receive &ndash; and does not appear to have received &ndash; money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has received substantial payments from foreign sources.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p><em>The New York Times</em> and other media encouraged U.S. District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judge sentencing the president&rsquo;s private attorney to three years in prison for a &ldquo;veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations &mdash;interests arguably magnified by the intense scrutiny of Cohen&rsquo;s criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the United States.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<blockquote> <p>&lsquo;Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.&rsquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kp0LbXCwIjk?feature=oembed\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Judge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen has said that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump.</p>",

                "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen came across as honest and likable, if flawed in his pubic House hearing testimony. He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in its sights first.\nAlmost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen\u2019s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man was spying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redacted search warrants and related materials that led up to that raid.\nThe agents had been interested in Cohen\u2019s business interests far earlier than indicated, since July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump\u2019s activities. The FBI obtained Cohen\u2019s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid.\nBefore a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof of specific crimes to convince him or her to sign the warrant.The FBI covered itself by submitting eight different application, affidavits, and search warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list the suspected crimes, and they did, according the Courthouse News Service:\n\u2018\u2026the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds of suspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\u2019\nThe FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:\n\u2018The FBI\u2019s raid on Cohen\u2019s home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.\u2019\nCohen\u2019s attorney Lanny Davis released a statement the night prior to the search warrants being served on his client. He wrote:\n\u2018Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.\u2019\nThe released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen\u2019s links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg.\nCohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump\u2019s television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. The stew just keeps getting thicker and thicker, spicier and spicier.\nDavis claimed that Firtash was an \u201cinnocent man.\u201d However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in \u201can international titanium scheme,\u201d the Courthouse News reported.\nCohen had set up a shell company named Essential Consultants LLC. He had also set up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with the shell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohen said the company was involved in real estate. He lied.\nA FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:\n\u2018Specifically, the account was not intended to receive \u2013 and does not appear to have received \u2013 money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has received substantial payments from foreign sources.\u2019\nThe New York Times and other media encouraged U.S. District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judge sentencing the president\u2019s private attorney to three years in prison for a \u201cveritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:\n\u2018These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations \u2014interests arguably magnified by the intense scrutiny of Cohen\u2019s criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the United States.\u2019\n\u2018Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.\u2019\nJudge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen has said that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump.",

Hutt,\u201d and \u201cJohn Snow\u201d (misspelling of Jon Snow from Game of Thrones).\nThe information was shared via a tweet from former Labor Department and Council of Economic Advisers, Martha Gimbel.\nThe Economic Report of the President has revealed that the quality of interns at CEA is much better than it was when I was there\u2026.we never got cool ones like Steve Rogers, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Aunt May, and John Cleese pic.twitter.com/qELM2729os\n\u2014 Martha Gimbel (@marthagimbel) March 19, 2019\nGimbel now works as a research director for the job posting website Indeed.com. She says in her tweet:\n\u2018The Economic Report of the President has revealed that the quality of interns at CEA is much better than it was when I was there.\n\u2018We never got cool ones like Steve Rogers, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, Aunt May, and John Cleese.\u2019\nOther fictional characters to appear on the list include John Cleese, Aunt May, Star Trek captain Kathryn Janeway. A fun, fictional group of CEA interns. But why? No one knows.\nThe report that was eventually released, contained 711 pages and still contained references to all of the fictional characters from Gimbel\u2019s tweet.\nIronically, these \u2018characters\u2019 are stated as \u201cproviding invaluable help with research projects, including fact-checking.\u201d\nFact-checking.\nWe\u2019re not sure if someone is trolling the public here, but this almost seems to bizarre to be true. However, yes\u2013 this is real life.\nIn 2017 it was reported by various news outlets that Trump\u2019s White House was struggling to fill hundreds of government positions. While it isn\u2019t confirmed, we\u2019re wondering if some of the positions were jobs such as White House Intern.\nPer CNBC:\n\u2018TRUMP IS EARLY IN HIS FIRST TERM AND HAS TIME TO FILL OUT THE GOVERNMENT. BUT IN A LEAN WHITE HOUSE PUSHING FOR A FLURRY OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY AND SHADOWED BY AN FBI PROBE, GETTING SKILLED INDIVIDUALS NOMINATED AND CONFIRMED COULD PROVE DIFFICULT.\u2019\nNominations and confirmations aside, it seems the White House struggles with even filling roles for bottom-the-barrel interns.\nIf you\u2019d like to view the full report for yourself, click here.\nHere are some of the best replies from Twitter:\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot.",

John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for the spotlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday. On Tuesday, he doubled down on his remarks during a press conference in the Oval Office, telling reporters he was &ldquo;never a fan&rdquo; of McCain&rsquo;s.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>President Trump escalates attack on late Sen.

Like many Republicans disgusted with Trump&rsquo;s embarrassing Twitter attacks and destruction of the GOP, he was appalled by Trump&rsquo;s continued bashing of Sen. McCain. On Twitter, he referred to the attacks as &ldquo;contemptible,&rdquo; saying that they are &ldquo;beneath our dignity as Americans.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Apparently, enough Americans have no dignity when it comes to politics, racism, misogyny, and Islamaphobia. No matter how many times Trump proves that he&rsquo;s giving a voice and a platform to white supremacists, his fans remain, but only because they don&rsquo;t care if white supremacy is emboldened by Trump. It doesn&rsquo;t affect the vast majority of them, and neither does Trump&rsquo;s complete annihilation of their own party.</p>\n<p>Weld had at least some supporters in his Twitter comments.

John McCain (R-AZ), whose death from brain cancer got entirely too much attention for the spotlight-seeking, thin-skinned president, on Sunday. On Tuesday, he doubled down on his remarks during a press conference in the Oval Office, telling reporters he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of McCain\u2019s.\nPresident Trump escalates attack on late Sen. John McCain: \"I was never a fan\" https://t.co/P3AVVhCK6G pic.twitter.com/SqQg3mFR7R\n\u2014 TIME (@TIME) March 19, 2019\nBill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts from 1991 to 1997, is considering a primary challenge to Trump in the GOP race. Like many Republicans disgusted with Trump\u2019s embarrassing Twitter attacks and destruction of the GOP, he was appalled by Trump\u2019s continued bashing of Sen. McCain. On Twitter, he referred to the attacks as \u201ccontemptible,\u201d saying that they are \u201cbeneath our dignity as Americans.\u201d\nApparently, enough Americans have no dignity when it comes to politics, racism, misogyny, and Islamaphobia. No matter how many times Trump proves that he\u2019s giving a voice and a platform to white supremacists, his fans remain, but only because they don\u2019t care if white supremacy is emboldened by Trump. It doesn\u2019t affect the vast majority of them, and neither does Trump\u2019s complete annihilation of their own party.\nWeld had at least some supporters in his Twitter comments.

The three-times-married, three-time cheater with porn stars and Playboy bunnies whose name is synonymous with greed as &ldquo;biblical&rdquo; and &ldquo;godly.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;[Trump] is highly biblical, and I would say to your listeners, we will in all likelihood never see a more godly, biblical president again in our lifetime.

The website features rhetoric like this and has a strong evangelical Christian following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Just what is the &lsquo;deep state&rsquo; and how are they promoting end-time lawlessness?

A multi-billionaire cabal is pushing for global government and Michele explains who they are and why.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>Throwback Monday: The thrice-married philanderer, who cheated on his third wife with a porn star while she was nursing his fifth child, thinks he is being audited by the IRS because he's a &quot;strong Christian.&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/yb1aJfYtYg\">https://t.co/yb1aJfYtYg</a></p> <p>&mdash; Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joncoopertweets/status/1117927085195124736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The real reasons for Trump&rsquo;s evangelical support were revealed soon into the interview. Trump hates who they hate: Muslims and transgender people. The &ldquo;Deep State&rdquo; wants Islamic jihad; Trump bashes a Muslim congresswoman and promised to ban Muslims from the country. The &ldquo;Deep State&rdquo; wants godly gender roles to disappear; Trump banned trans soldiers from the military. The religious group who claim to be followers of a prophet who preached love and forgiveness are all in for a man who doesn&rsquo;t know the meaning of either of those words.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Bachmann&rsquo;s comments about Trump&rsquo;s faith immediately followed a portion of the interview where she praised his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/04/13/transgender-military-ban-trump-marquardt-pkg-vpx.cnn\">military ban on transgender personnel</a>, explaining that &ldquo;he has stood up where most Republicans wouldn&rsquo;t dare to stand up.&rdquo; In fact, when evangelicals call Trump biblical, they are often talking about his policies on issues like Israel and abortion, rather than personal morality.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>&quot;The Bible means a lot to me, but I don't want to get into specifics&quot; &mdash; Trump.

The fact that extreme cold records are getting more rare is one of the trends that's becoming clear to people.</p>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>AP shared an analysis of warm temperature records versus cold records since 1920 within the Lower 48 states. The data consists of daily high maximum temperature records as well as daily low minimum temperature records set at a subset of 424 stations from the U.S. Historical Climate Network.</p>\n<p><strong>Context: </strong>Global warming, by raising average surface temperatures, is making high maximum temperatures easier to set than low temperature milestones. This shift is particularly visible when looking at decadal averages.</p>\n<ul><li>AP reports: &quot;Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low.&quot;</li><li>In a stable climate (one that is not warming or cooling significantly overall), one would expect that ratio to be closer to 1:1.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>A caveat: </strong>The analysis does not capture the increase in record warm overnight low temperatures, which is one hallmark of climate change and contributes to more dangerous heat waves, since warm overnight temperatures prevent the human body from cooling down.</p>\n<p><strong>What they're saying: &quot;</strong>In a world without human-caused climate change, the rounds of record cold and record warm air would balance out over time,&quot; says Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, a climate research and news organization.</p>\n<ul><li>&quot;That's not what's happening. Record warmth is far outpacing record cold. In fact, that's one of the reasons this <a data-vars-click-url=\"https://www.axios.com/polar-vortex-arctic-outbreak-shatters-records-midwest-14cfb212-3cf3-4df7-87f8-5d58d717faa0.html\" data-vars-content-id=\"02f86e11-5d83-47d4-944b-5856745c1d2b\" data-vars-event-category=\"story\" data-vars-headline=\"The ratio of warm and cold temperature records is increasingly skewed\" data-vars-item=\"in_content_link\" data-vars-link-text=\"winter's polar vortex\" data-vars-sub-category=\"story\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/polar-vortex-arctic-outbreak-shatters-records-midwest-14cfb212-3cf3-4df7-87f8-5d58d717faa0.html\">winter's polar vortex</a> was newsworthy, we just don't get record cold as often or intensely as we used to,&quot; she tells Axios.</li><li>&quot;People often have a hard time feeling and visualizing a rise in average temperature, but extremes and records smack you in the face. The extremes are what reshape lives &mdash; change camp and sports practice schedules, interrupt and stress outdoor work (from farms to construction), require cooling centers, increase heat-related illnesses, and sometimes even lead to death,&quot; she adds.</li><li>Other scientists Axios contacted said the ratio of warm to cold temperature records is not an intuitive indicator of climate change over time, though it's tied to increasing average temperatures. </li></ul>\n<p><strong>Go deeper: </strong></p>",

                "text": "As the average global temperature increases due to human-caused global warming, the ratio between warm temperature and cold temperature records in the U.S. is increasingly skewed toward heat milestones, an Associated Press analysis shows.\nThe big picture: The analysis, shared with Axios, indicates that the biggest contributor to the trend is the rapidly shrinking number of cold records, although the extreme heat events are also becoming more common and severe.\nWhy it matters: The way we experience global warming is largely through extreme events, from heat waves to heavy precipitation events to wildfires. The fact that extreme cold records are getting more rare is one of the trends that's becoming clear to people.\nBackground: AP shared an analysis of warm temperature records versus cold records since 1920 within the Lower 48 states. The data consists of daily high maximum temperature records as well as daily low minimum temperature records set at a subset of 424 stations from the U.S. Historical Climate Network.\nContext: Global warming, by raising average surface temperatures, is making high maximum temperatures easier to set than low temperature milestones. This shift is particularly visible when looking at decadal averages.\nAP reports: \"Since 1999, the ratio has been two warm records set or broken for every cold one. In 16 of the last 20 years, there have been more daily high temperature records than low.\"\nIn a stable climate (one that is not warming or cooling significantly overall), one would expect that ratio to be closer to 1:1.\nA caveat: The analysis does not capture the increase in record warm overnight low temperatures, which is one hallmark of climate change and contributes to more dangerous heat waves, since warm overnight temperatures prevent the human body from cooling down.\nWhat they're saying: \"In a world without human-caused climate change, the rounds of record cold and record warm air would balance out over time,\" says Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, a climate research and news organization.\n\"That's not what's happening. Record warmth is far outpacing record cold. In fact, that's one of the reasons this winter's polar vortex was newsworthy, we just don't get record cold as often or intensely as we used to,\" she tells Axios.\n\"People often have a hard time feeling and visualizing a rise in average temperature, but extremes and records smack you in the face. The extremes are what reshape lives \u2014 change camp and sports practice schedules, interrupt and stress outdoor work (from farms to construction), require cooling centers, increase heat-related illnesses, and sometimes even lead to death,\" she adds.\nOther scientists Axios contacted said the ratio of warm to cold temperature records is not an intuitive indicator of climate change over time, though it's tied to increasing average temperatures.\nGo deeper:",

Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the panel, and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), the subcommittee chairman on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, told McAleenan to turn over information related to Trump\u2019s alleged promise and \"make himself\" and other department officials available to testify before the committee.\nThe backdrop: Frustrated by the spike in migrant border crossings, Trump threatened to close the border if Mexico failed to restrict the flow of asylum seekers trying to come into the U.S.\nCNN and the New York Times reported last week that Trump privately made the request to McAleenan \u2014 who was then the commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol \u2014 during a border visit in Calexico, Calif., earlier this month.\nTrump denied the reports on Twitter, saying: \"Of course this is not true. Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day!\"\n\"These allegations, if true, would represent a grave breach of duties of the president. Congress has an independent constitutional duty to provide oversight of the administration of government by the executive branch.\"\n\u2014 Nadler and Cohen wrote\nThe Democrats also added that this follows what they called a \"troubling pattern of conduct that has emerged over the past two years that appears to demonstrate that President Trump views the pardon power as a political tool, or even worse, as an expedient mechanism for circumventing the law or avoiding the consequences of his own conduct.\"\nGo deeper:",

The board last week ordered a new election after its probe found that a political operative working on behalf of Harris had coordinated an \"unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme,\" including cover-up efforts.",

Congress does not have the votes to override this decision. This is the second veto of Trump's presidency.

Photo: Rick T. Wilking/Getty</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Walmart has offered a glimpse at how it plans to move its stores into the future, announcing the addition of 3,900 aisle-mopping and shelf-scanning robots to its floors.</p>\n<p><strong>Reality check:</strong> Though 3,900 robots is a massive deployment, the impact to jobs will be significantly diluted as those bots are spread across 4,700 stores, says Darrell West of the Brookings Institution.</p>\n<p>Among the bots joining Walmart's workforce: 1,500 autonomous janitors, 300 shelf-scanners, 1,200 truck unloaders and 900 pickup towers that put items ordered online into a vending machine for customers to retrieve.</p>\n<p><strong>The big question:</strong> Walmart says the workers whose jobs these bots will replace will move to &quot;more fulfilling&quot; customer service work. But can the company really absorb the impact of automation?</p>\n<p>A common refrain among companies that add scores of bots alongside human workers is that they will free up humans from menial tasks to do more interesting work.</p>\n<p>Experts worry that only a portion of humans will actually be &quot;freed up,&quot; and the rest face layoffs.</p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s happening at Walmart:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>In many cases, such as with the truck-unloading bot, the machines are doing jobs that Walmart has long had difficulty filling anyway, says spokesperson Ragan Dickens.</li><li>Walmart says it also has added 40,000 new online grocery picker jobs &mdash; people who assemble shopping bags for online customers &mdash; in the last two years.</li></ul>\n<p><strong>But, but, but:</strong> As robots' capabilities expand, they could come for those and other jobs Walmart says it is setting aside for humans, says Brookings' West. &quot;Automation could threaten jobs because robots likely will perform <em>many</em> routine tasks. The company already has introduced self checkout and is experimenting with automated checkouts.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "Walmart has offered a glimpse at how it plans to move its stores into the future, announcing the addition of 3,900 aisle-mopping and shelf-scanning robots to its floors.\nReality check: Though 3,900 robots is a massive deployment, the impact to jobs will be significantly diluted as those bots are spread across 4,700 stores, says Darrell West of the Brookings Institution.\nAmong the bots joining Walmart's workforce: 1,500 autonomous janitors, 300 shelf-scanners, 1,200 truck unloaders and 900 pickup towers that put items ordered online into a vending machine for customers to retrieve.\nThe big question: Walmart says the workers whose jobs these bots will replace will move to \"more fulfilling\" customer service work. But can the company really absorb the impact of automation?\nA common refrain among companies that add scores of bots alongside human workers is that they will free up humans from menial tasks to do more interesting work.\nExperts worry that only a portion of humans will actually be \"freed up,\" and the rest face layoffs.\nWhat\u2019s happening at Walmart:\nIn many cases, such as with the truck-unloading bot, the machines are doing jobs that Walmart has long had difficulty filling anyway, says spokesperson Ragan Dickens.\nWalmart says it also has added 40,000 new online grocery picker jobs \u2014 people who assemble shopping bags for online customers \u2014 in the last two years.\nBut, but, but: As robots' capabilities expand, they could come for those and other jobs Walmart says it is setting aside for humans, says Brookings' West. \"Automation could threaten jobs because robots likely will perform many routine tasks. The company already has introduced self checkout and is experimenting with automated checkouts.\"",

While there is no conclusive evidence so far that they are linked, French experts analysing the Ethiopian Airlines' flight data black box say early investigations point to \"clear similarities\".\nExperts believe a new automated system in Boeing's aircraft - intended to stop stalling by dipping the nose - may have played a role in both crashes, with pilots unable to override it.\nBoeing said in a statement that it would fully cooperate with the inspector general's review.",

                "text": "Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir has been moved to Kobar maximum security prison, days after he was deposed in a military coup.\nReports say the ex-leader has until now been detained at the presidential residence under heavy guard.\nHe is reportedly being held in solitary confinement and is surrounded by tight security.\nMonths of protests in Sudan led to the ousting and arrest of the long-time ruler on Thursday.\nUganda's Minister for Foreign Affairs Henry Oryem Okello told Reuters news agency the country would consider offering the deposed leader asylum if he applied, despite an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC).\nAs an ICC member, Uganda would have to hand over Mr Bashir if he arrived in the country. The ICC has not yet commented.\nAfrica Live: Updates on this and other stories from Africa\nWhy Omar al-Bashir was overthrown\nTimeline: How Sudan got here\nUntil now, Mr Bashir's whereabouts since his removal were unknown. The coup leader at the time, Awad Ibn Auf, said Mr Bashir was being detained in a \"safe place\". He himself stood down soon afterwards.\nLt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days.\nDemonstrators have vowed to stay on the streets until there is an immediate move to civilian rule.\nProtesters show calm conviction\nBy Joe Inwood, BBC News, Khartoum\nA sea of doctors, shouting with such anger and passion that their voices crack. Thousands are still protesting outside the military institutions that for 30 years sustained the brutal regime of President Bashir.\nNow, the military council that deposed him is struggling to maintain an increasingly fragile grip on power, while the man who once led the country sits in prison.\nToday it has emerged he is in solitary confinement, locked in the very place where so many of his victims were held, tortured and killed.\nOrdinary people have managed to bring an entrenched and violent regime to its knees. They have done it not through force of arms, but through calm conviction, passion and a dedication to their cause that you can see in their eyes.\nWho is Omar al-Bashir?\nMr Bashir led Sudan for close to 30 years.\nHe is accused of organising war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan's western Darfur region, for which the ICC issued an arrest warrant.\nAfter months of protests - starting in response to a rise in living costs and morphing into calls for the government to resign - Sudan's military toppled Mr Bashir in a coup on Thursday.\nThe transitional military council was set up in the wake of his removal, and has said it will stay in place for a maximum of two years until a civilian government can be put in place.\nWhat are conditions like in the prison?\nKober prison, situated on the east bank of the Blue Nile, was built during Britain's near 60-year colonial rule of Sudan.\nThe building, built with bricks and surrounded by towering concrete walls, has the capacity to hold hundreds of prisoners. Space in its tiny cells, however, is said to be scarce.\nMany of the protesters and opposition leaders who took to the streets demanding Mr Bashir's resignation have been detained on its special wing for political prisoners.\nSudan's feared National Intelligence and Security Service runs this wing, not the police.\nOmar al-Bashir: Sudan's ousted president\nSudan analyst Alex de Waal, who has visited the prison, told the BBC its infrastructure has not been updated since it was built.\n\"The cells are very rudimentary, it is a very basic form of accommodation, there is no air conditioning or running water,\" he said.\nNevertheless, the prison has a reputation for treating the inmates well and not subjecting them to random violence, he added.\nA former detainee at the prison told AFP news agency that up to seven prisoners, most of whom are petty criminals, are typically housed in each cell.\n\"There is a bathroom in each cell but no beds - only mattresses and mosquitoes,\" the former inmate, who was jailed there during protests against Mr Bashir's rule in January last year, said.\nWhat's the latest with the protesters?\nDemonstrators remain camped out the military headquarters in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.\nReports on Monday said there had been efforts to disperse a sit-in, but protesters joined hands and troops stepped back from a confrontation.\nSudan protests: A campaign of defiance\nWhy the protests started\nThe Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which has spearheaded the protests, urged supporters to stop efforts to disperse them, calling on demonstrators to \"protect your revolution and your accomplishments\".\nAn SPA spokesman told the BBC that the group \"completely rejected\" the transitional military council leading the country, and said protesters seek the dismantling of state intelligence agencies and the \"full dissolution of the deep state\".\nWhat has the military said?\nMilitary council spokesman Maj Gen Shams Ad-din Shanto announced a raft of new measures on Sunday, including the end of censorship and new heads of the security forces.\nThe council has arrested former government members, he said, and will put in place whatever civilian government and whichever prime minister opposition groups agree.\nAre military takeovers on the rise in Africa?\nBut while the council promised not to remove protesters from their sit-in, the major also called on them to stop unauthorised roadblocks and \"let normal life resume\".\n\"Taking up arms will not be tolerated,\" he added.",

He was then driven to Hanoi, where heavy security and flag-waving crowds were waiting for him.</p>\n<figure> <img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p071yjtg.jpg\"></img>  <figcaption>Mr Kim arrived by train at the border station of Dong Dang</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mr Kim is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo-jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong-chol, both familiar faces from the previous summit with Mr Trump.</p>\n<h2>Why did Mr Kim take a train to Vietnam? </h2>\n<p>The journey from Pyongyang to Vietnam took more than two days and traversed about 4,000 km (2,485 miles). Had Mr Kim chosen to fly to Vietnam he would have got there in a matter of hours.</p>\n<p>As Mr Kim's train passed through China, roads were closed and train stations shut down. Chinese social media was abuzz with road closures, traffic congestion and delayed trains.</p>\n<figure> <img src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p071y183.jpg\"></img>  <figcaption>Kim Jong-un boards his train</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Vietnam's Dong Dang station was also closed to the public ahead of his arrival on Tuesday morning. He is now being driven around 170km (105mi) to Hanoi by car.</p>\n<p>It's little surprise that Mr Kim chose to take the train as this is how his grandfather, North Korea's first leader Kim ll-sung, travelled when he went to Vietnam and Eastern Europe.</p>\n<p>That alone would have made it a highly symbolic move for the younger Mr Kim.</p>\n<p>Mr Kim's private green and yellow train has 21 bulletproof carriages and is luxurious, with plush pink leather sofas and conference rooms so the journey would not have been uncomfortable.</p>\n<h2>What will Trump and Kim do in Vietnam? </h2>\n<p>Unlike the North Korean leader, Mr Trump travelled to Hanoi by plane. The presidential airliner Air Force One left Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, landing in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday night local time.</p>\n<p>Details of their schedule are only just becoming clear. Mr Trump will meet Mr Kim for a brief one-on-one conversation on Wednesday evening and then they will have dinner together with their advisers, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. On Thursday, the leaders will meet for a series of back-and-forth meetings.</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47222063\">Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47361742\">What North Korea can learn from Vietnam's women</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47208489\">Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide</a></li> </ul>\n<h2>Why are they meeting again?</h2>\n<p>The Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June.</p>\n<p>That meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement, with both leaders agreeing to work towards denuclearisation - though it was never made clear what this would entail.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>  Nothing concrete was produced as a result of the first Singapore summit  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>However, little diplomatic progress was made following the summit.</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-40871848\">North Korea crisis in 300 words</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-47379828/trump-kim-summit-what-north-koreans-are-saying\">WATCH: 'I really miss our leader Kim'</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44484322\">What was agreed at the first Trump-Kim summit?</a></li> </ul>\n<p>This time round, both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress.</p>\n<p>However, Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit, saying he was in &quot;no rush&quot; to press for North Korea's denuclearisation.</p>\n<p>&quot;I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>Washington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief.</p>\n<h2>Why Vietnam?</h2>\n<p>It's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>  Hanoi is all geared up for the upcoming summit  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ideologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries - though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, all while the party there retains absolute power.</p>",

                "text": "US President Donald Trump has arrived in Vietnam ahead of his second summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.\nAir Force One landed at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport hours after Mr Kim reached the Vietnamese capital by train and car.\nThe summit, which is due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday, follows a historic first round of talks in Singapore last year.\nThe two leaders are expected to discuss progress towards ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons.\nCeremonial guards had lined a red carpet laid out for Mr Kim as he arrived at Dong Dang border station on Tuesday morning. He was then driven to Hanoi, where heavy security and flag-waving crowds were waiting for him.\nMr Kim is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo-jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong-chol, both familiar faces from the previous summit with Mr Trump.\nWhy did Mr Kim take a train to Vietnam?\nThe journey from Pyongyang to Vietnam took more than two days and traversed about 4,000 km (2,485 miles). Had Mr Kim chosen to fly to Vietnam he would have got there in a matter of hours.\nAs Mr Kim's train passed through China, roads were closed and train stations shut down. Chinese social media was abuzz with road closures, traffic congestion and delayed trains.\nVietnam's Dong Dang station was also closed to the public ahead of his arrival on Tuesday morning. He is now being driven around 170km (105mi) to Hanoi by car.\nIt's little surprise that Mr Kim chose to take the train as this is how his grandfather, North Korea's first leader Kim ll-sung, travelled when he went to Vietnam and Eastern Europe.\nThat alone would have made it a highly symbolic move for the younger Mr Kim.\nMr Kim's private green and yellow train has 21 bulletproof carriages and is luxurious, with plush pink leather sofas and conference rooms so the journey would not have been uncomfortable.\nWhat will Trump and Kim do in Vietnam?\nUnlike the North Korean leader, Mr Trump travelled to Hanoi by plane. The presidential airliner Air Force One left Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, landing in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday night local time.\nDetails of their schedule are only just becoming clear. Mr Trump will meet Mr Kim for a brief one-on-one conversation on Wednesday evening and then they will have dinner together with their advisers, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. On Thursday, the leaders will meet for a series of back-and-forth meetings.\nWhy Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam\nWhat North Korea can learn from Vietnam's women\nTrump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide\nWhy are they meeting again?\nThe Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June.\nThat meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement, with both leaders agreeing to work towards denuclearisation - though it was never made clear what this would entail.\nHowever, little diplomatic progress was made following the summit.\nNorth Korea crisis in 300 words\nWATCH: 'I really miss our leader Kim'\nWhat was agreed at the first Trump-Kim summit?\nThis time round, both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress.\nHowever, Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit, saying he was in \"no rush\" to press for North Korea's denuclearisation.\n\"I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,\" he said.\nWashington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief.\nWhy Vietnam?\nIt's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances.\nIdeologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries - though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, all while the party there retains absolute power.",

                "text": "Pakistan says it will respond \"at the time and place of its choosing\" after India launched strikes against militants in Pakistani territory.\nIndia said it had killed a large number of militants but Pakistan called the claim \"reckless\".\nTensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been high following an attack on Indian troops in Kashmir.\nThe attack was claimed by a group based in Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and India had vowed to retaliate.\nIndia accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory, something Pakistan denies.\nViewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation\nWhat is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad?\nWhy India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir\nBoth India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The two have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir.\nThe strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971.\nWhat happened?\nThe two sides have given different versions of events. Indian officials said the strikes hit a camp in Balakot, in north-west Pakistan.\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said a \"large number\" of militants were killed, defending the raids as a \"pre-emptive strike\" to stop further JeM attacks.\nResidents in Balakot told the BBC they were woken by loud explosions but there has been no confirmation of casualties.\nThe Pakistani army denied there were any casualties. It said its jets forced Indian planes to withdraw and drop their \"payload\" in an sparsely inhabited area.\nWhat has the response been?\nPakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said India had \"resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim\", pointing to elections due in India in May.\nA meeting of Pakistan's National Security Committee, which includes Prime Minister Imran Khan, ended with a warning Pakistan would \"respond at the time and place of its choosing\".\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan on Tuesday but he told crowds: \"I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes.\"\nAmid fears of escalation, the European Union urged \"maximum restraint\" from both sides, with China making a similar plea.\nTensions reach a dangerous level\nAnalysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad\nThe Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level.\nIn September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called \"surgical strikes\".\nIndia's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant camps on the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces.\nThis time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years.\nPakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known.\nAlso, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike \"across the LoC\", not one across the international border.\nPakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir \"at an appropriate time\".\nTimeline of India-Pakistan tensions\nOctober 1947: First war between India and Pakistan over Kashmir just two months after they become independent nations.\nAugust 1965: The neighbours fight another brief war over Kashmir.\nDecember 1971: India supports East Pakistan's bid to become independent. The Indian air force conducts bombing raids inside Pakistan. The war ends with the creation of Bangladesh.\nMay 1999: Pakistani soldiers and militants occupy Indian military posts in Kargil mountains. India launches air and ground strikes and the intruders are pushed back.\nOctober 2001: A devastating attack on the state assembly in Indian-administered Kashmir kills 38. Two months later, an attack on the Indian parliament in Delhi leaves 14 dead.\nNovember 2008: Co-ordinated attacks on Mumbai's main railway station, luxury hotels and a Jewish cultural centre kill 166 people. India blames Pakistan-based group Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nJanuary 2016: Four-day attack on Indian air base in Pathankot leaves seven Indian soldiers and six militants dead.\n18 September 2016: Attack on army base in Uri in Indian-administered Kashmir kills 19 soldiers.\n30 September 2016: India says it carried \"surgical strikes\" on militants in Pakistani Kashmir. Islamabad denies strikes took place.",

The cardinal immediately denied any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>Some pre-trial hearings where <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-43281940\">Pell was swamped by media outside court</a> were allowed to be reported.</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-47366113\">Cardinal Pell found guilty of sexual offences</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47201647\">How will the Pope tackle sexual abuse?</a></li> </ul>\n<p>Those hearings revealed for the first time that Pell faced separate accusations from the 1990s and the 1970s. Consequently, a judge ordered that two trials - with separate juries - would take place.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>  Pell was swarmed by media during his pre-trial hearings in Melbourne last year  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>In a bid to prevent the first trial influencing the second, the judge agreed to an immediate suppression order.</p>\n<p>It made it illegal to report that any trial was taking place. Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited. It allowed reporting that Pell was facing abuse allegations, but nothing more specific.</p>\n<p>The legal order legally applied only to Australia. But it effectively extended to international media which publish or broadcast into Australia, or can be accessed there, a tough thing to avoid in the internet age.</p>\n<h2>Did everyone follow the rules? </h2>\n<p>That may be subject to legal debate but the judge expressed fury about some reporting.</p>\n<p>Australian outlets were generally most cautious, with journalists sitting in regularly on Pell's case and adhering to the ban.</p>\n<p>The blackout did not go totally unnoticed publicly. Social media users, for instance, frequently speculated about it.</p>\n<p>But matters escalated dramatically in December when numerous non-Australian outlets published stories reporting that Pell had been convicted. The words &quot;George Pell&quot; were soon trending online, including in Australia.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>  A protester outside court after the reporting ban was lifted on Tuesday  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>It prompted some of Australia's biggest newspapers to run front-page editorials criticising the suppression order. Unlike overseas media, they did not name Pell.</p>\n<p>&quot;The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,&quot; wrote Melbourne's Herald Sun, below a headline &quot;CENSORED&quot;.</p>\n<p>&quot;The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It's a story you deserve to read.&quot;</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44209971\">Abuse and the Church: What you need to know</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-38877158\">Inquiry hears 7% of Australian Catholic priests abused children</a></li> </ul>\n<p>Sydney's Daily Telegraph described it as the nation's biggest story, and wrote: &quot;An awful crime. The person is guilty. Yet we can't publish it.&quot;</p>\n<p>Melbourne newspaper The Age and other publications also published articles, some giving details of the case.</p>\n<p>In a specially convened court hearing on 13 December, Judge Peter Kidd said he was &quot;angry&quot; about media reports though he did not mention specific outlets.</p>\n<p>&quot;Given how potentially egregious and flagrant these breaches are, a number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment,&quot; he told lawyers for the prosecution and defence.</p>\n<p>The judge left the matter with prosecutors to investigate. Digital versions of some front pages were later unavailable.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/contact-us/editorial\">Report</a></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Twitter post by @thetowncrier: Those outraged front pages by the @dailytelegraph and @theheraldsun railing against censorship?

On Tuesday, prosecutors withdrew the charges relating to the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Lawyer Justin Quill, whose firm is acting on behalf of local media outlets, argued that judges needed to &quot;have more faith&quot; in jurors to form their view from a courtroom even if they had seen something related to the case on social media.</p>\n<p>&quot;For the public to not be told [about Pell's conviction] until nearly three months later is, in my view, a situation that is not appropriate,&quot; he told the BBC.</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47348479\">Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47264130\">US cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47343458\">Cardinal says abuse files destroyed</a></li> </ul>\n<p>He also said courts could not &quot;go around charging 10,000 people for one or two comments they've made on Twitter&quot;, adding: &quot;Mainstream media is being held to one standard, and the general public is being held to another - it just doesn't make sense.&quot;</p>\n<h2>'The Suppression State'</h2>\n<p>Suppression orders are common in Australia unlike in other countries such as the US.</p>\n<p>But the state of Victoria in particular has come in for criticism, accounting for more than half of the country's orders, local media reports.

                "text": "They were sex abuse allegations that rocked the Catholic Church and generated enormous interest - only for the case to vanish suddenly from public view for nine months.\nThe trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell can now be reported after an Australian judge lifted a legal order that had prohibited coverage.\nThe sweeping ban, known as a suppression order, was handed down last May.\nIt was deemed necessary to give Pell fair hearings but caused big debate.\nThe rationale for the ban\nPolice charged Pell with sex offences in June 2017, saying only that he faced \"historical\" allegations by \"multiple complainants\". The cardinal immediately denied any wrongdoing.\nSome pre-trial hearings where Pell was swamped by media outside court were allowed to be reported.\nCardinal Pell found guilty of sexual offences\nHow will the Pope tackle sexual abuse?\nThose hearings revealed for the first time that Pell faced separate accusations from the 1990s and the 1970s. Consequently, a judge ordered that two trials - with separate juries - would take place.\nIn a bid to prevent the first trial influencing the second, the judge agreed to an immediate suppression order.\nIt made it illegal to report that any trial was taking place. Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited. It allowed reporting that Pell was facing abuse allegations, but nothing more specific.\nThe legal order legally applied only to Australia. But it effectively extended to international media which publish or broadcast into Australia, or can be accessed there, a tough thing to avoid in the internet age.\nDid everyone follow the rules?\nThat may be subject to legal debate but the judge expressed fury about some reporting.\nAustralian outlets were generally most cautious, with journalists sitting in regularly on Pell's case and adhering to the ban.\nThe blackout did not go totally unnoticed publicly. Social media users, for instance, frequently speculated about it.\nBut matters escalated dramatically in December when numerous non-Australian outlets published stories reporting that Pell had been convicted. The words \"George Pell\" were soon trending online, including in Australia.\nIt prompted some of Australia's biggest newspapers to run front-page editorials criticising the suppression order. Unlike overseas media, they did not name Pell.\n\"The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,\" wrote Melbourne's Herald Sun, below a headline \"CENSORED\".\n\"The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It's a story you deserve to read.\"\nAbuse and the Church: What you need to know\nInquiry hears 7% of Australian Catholic priests abused children\nSydney's Daily Telegraph described it as the nation's biggest story, and wrote: \"An awful crime. The person is guilty. Yet we can't publish it.\"\nMelbourne newspaper The Age and other publications also published articles, some giving details of the case.\nIn a specially convened court hearing on 13 December, Judge Peter Kidd said he was \"angry\" about media reports though he did not mention specific outlets.\n\"Given how potentially egregious and flagrant these breaches are, a number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment,\" he told lawyers for the prosecution and defence.\nThe judge left the matter with prosecutors to investigate. Digital versions of some front pages were later unavailable.\nReport\nOther Australian journalists, however, voiced support for the suppression order, expressing concerns that publicity could influence a court outcome.\nReport\nSo was the ban effective?\nSome say it was not but others disagree, arguing that most people did not know about Pell's conviction before Tuesday.\nAnd, ultimately, his second trial will not proceed. On Tuesday, prosecutors withdrew the charges relating to the 1970s.\nLawyer Justin Quill, whose firm is acting on behalf of local media outlets, argued that judges needed to \"have more faith\" in jurors to form their view from a courtroom even if they had seen something related to the case on social media.\n\"For the public to not be told [about Pell's conviction] until nearly three months later is, in my view, a situation that is not appropriate,\" he told the BBC.\nPope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice\nUS cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations\nCardinal says abuse files destroyed\nHe also said courts could not \"go around charging 10,000 people for one or two comments they've made on Twitter\", adding: \"Mainstream media is being held to one standard, and the general public is being held to another - it just doesn't make sense.\"\n'The Suppression State'\nSuppression orders are common in Australia unlike in other countries such as the US.\nBut the state of Victoria in particular has come in for criticism, accounting for more than half of the country's orders, local media reports. Critics sometimes deride it as \"The Suppression State\".\nReport\nState Premier Daniel Andrews has vowed to implement 18 recommendations from a review by a retired judge that called for a \"real-world\" approach to suppression orders, given how quickly information can be spread online.\n\"This is about making sure the laws relating to contempt of court and suppression orders are working effectively by protecting victims, but also the public's right to know as well as court processes,\" state Attorney General Martin Pakula said in October.",

Police forced the door open and found Mr Garcia sitting on a chair with a bullet wound to his head.\nBrazil's Odebrecht corruption scandal\n'The largest foreign bribery case in history'\nHealth minister Zulema Tom\u00e1s said Mr Garc\u00eda's condition was \"very serious and critical\", and that he had to be resuscitated after suffering three cardiac arrests.\n\"Let's pray to God to give him strength,\" the former president's lawyer Erasmo Reyna reportedly told journalists at the hospital.\nMr Garc\u00eda served as president from 1985 to 1990 and again from 2006 to 2011.\nInvestigators say he took bribes from Odebrecht during his second term in office, linked to a metro line building project in the capital.\nOdebrecht has admitted paying almost $30m (\u00a323m) in bribes in Peru since 2004.\nBut Mr Garc\u00eda says he is the victim of political persecution, writing in a tweet on Tuesday that there is \"no clue or evidence\" against him.\nWhat is the Odebrecht scandal?\nOdebrecht is a Brazilian construction giant behind major infrastructure projects around the world, including venues for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup in its home country.\nBut under the glare of anti-corruption investigators the company admitted paying bribes in more than half of the countries in Latin America, as well as in Angola and Mozambique in Africa.\nInvestigators say Odebrecht bribed officials or electoral candidates in exchange for lucrative building contracts.\nThe corruption scandal has brought down politicians throughout Latin America.\nHow is Peru affected?\nPeru's four most recent presidents are all being investigated for alleged corruption, with a fifth - Alberto Fujimori - serving a prison sentence for corruption and human rights abuses.\nEx-leader Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was taken to hospital with high blood pressure on Wednesday just days after his own arrest in connection with Odebrecht charges.\nAnd the current leader of the opposition, Keiko Fujimori, is also in pre-trial detention on charges of taking $1.2m (\u00a3940,000) in bribes from Odebrecht.\nIn October, an opinion poll by Datum showed 94% of Peruvians believed the level of corruption was either high or very high in their country.\nThe scandal embroiling Peru's presidents\nPedro Pablo Kuczynski, in office 2016-2018, resigned over a vote-buying scandal and detained last week\nOllanta Humala, in office 2011-2016, accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht to bankroll his election campaign, in pre-trial detention in Peru\nAlan Garc\u00eda, in office 2006-2011, suspected of taking kickbacks from Odebrecht, sought asylum in Uruguay's Lima embassy but had his request denied\nAlejandro Toledo, in office 2001-2006, accused of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Odebrecht, currently a fugitive in the US",

His Wednesday testimony to the House Oversight Committee will be public.\nUS media have published a copy of his opening statement online.\nThe 52-year-old was convicted last year by New York federal prosecutors of campaign finance violations and tax evasion and by special counsel Robert Mueller of lying to Congress about Trump Organization plans in Moscow.\nMr Mueller is nearing the end of a 21-month justice department investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, which both Mr Trump and Russia have denied.\nThe Trump-Russia saga in 250 words\nMichael Cohen: Trump's personal lawyer\nAt his December sentencing Cohen, a former Trump loyalist, blamed his misdeeds on \"a blind loyalty\" to Mr Trump.\nAhead of the hearings, the president tweeted an attack on his former lawyer, accusing him of \"lying in order to reduce his prison time\".\nThe Wall Street Journal reported a person familiar with the matter as saying Cohen would provide \"evidence of criminal conduct since Mr Trump became president\" that involved a hush money payment to conceal an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels.\nTrump says hush money payments were legal\nThe lawyer will accuse Mr Trump of being directly involved in efforts to conceal the alleged affair weeks before the 2016 election, according to US media.\nThe president has denied having the affair, or that he told Cohen to pay off Ms Daniels.\nAccording to the Journal, Cohen will detail Mr Trump's \"lies, racism and cheating\" over a decade of working for him.\nHe is expected to offer financial documents showing possible tax fraud by Mr Trump, which may spur lawmakers to renew demands for the president's tax returns.\nThe president's former right hand man will also describe racist remarks from Mr Trump during their private conversations.\nThe Journal reports Cohen will accuse the president of questioning the intelligence of African Americans.\nCBS News reported a source as saying the racist language allegedly used by the president is \"chilling\".\nCohen is also expected to offer explanations to lawmakers about why he lied to them about the Trump Organization's plans to build a tower in Moscow.\nMore on Trump-Russia:\nWhat might 'Mueller report' look like?\nTrump's tower in Moscow that never was\nWho's who in the drama to end all dramas?\nDemocrat Elijah Cummings, chair of the Oversight Committee, said last week lawmakers would question Cohen about Mr Trump's possible conflicts of interest and finances.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have highlighted Cohen's unreliability.\nIn an op-ed in USA Today on Tuesday, Republican Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina called the hearing \"a partisan circus meant to destroy Trump\".\nMeanwhile, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz is denying that a tweet directed at Cohen was a threat.\nIn a text message exchange with a reporter for Vox, Mr Gaetz denied the tweet was considered witness-tampering, contending it was \"witness-testing\".\nIt comes after Cohen's originally scheduled testimony was postponed, after he cited \"threats against his family\" brought by Mr Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani.",

The incident prompted her to reveal that she had been diagnosed with Graves' disease - an autoimmune thyroid condition.",

Later that evening, Ali tweeted the $1.8m goal had been reached, including $20,000 donated by model Chrissy Teigen.</p>\n<p>&quot;It shows that the church is not only fireproof, but it's also faith-proof,&quot; <a href=\"https://kadn.com/support-pours-in-for-st-landry-parish-churches/\">Pastor Mason Jack told local news channel News15.</a> &quot;To get calls from New York, and across the country and to show love for our sister churches means a whole lot to us,&quot; he said.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>  Holden Matthews has been charged with hate crimes  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>All three of the Louisiana fires were started with gasoline and occurred around Opelousas, about 60 miles (100km) west of the state capital of Baton Rouge.</p>\n<p>Holden Matthews, 21, a son of a local police deputy was arrested over the fires and has now been charged with hate crimes.

                "text": "The outpouring of generosity in response to the fire at Notre-Dame cathedral has led to a renewed focus on fundraising for black churches in the United States that were destroyed by an arsonist earlier this year.\nThe influx of sympathy and money for the churches led to the appeal reaching its target of $1.8m in three days.\nOn Monday, as French firefighters tackled the blaze at the 850-year-old building, Louisiana resident Megan Romer tweeted her sadness over the cathedral's destruction.\nHowever, she also took the opportunity to divert her followers' attention to three other churches devastated by fire that did not have billionaires queuing up to save them.\n\"If you are going to donate money to rebuild a church this week, I implore you to make it the black churches in St. Landry Parish,\" Ms Romer wrote.\nShe was referring were three historically black churches in Louisiana that were subject to arson attacks in late March and earlier this month. St Mary Baptist Church, the Greater Union Baptist Church and the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church were razed to the ground.\nWhen Ms Romer wrote her appeal, the fundraising page of the three churches was far short of its $1.8m goal - with fewer than $100,000 raised.\nWhile acknowledging the huge importance of the French cathedral, she wrote: \"Remember that famous history isn't the only history. Imagine the courage it took to build and fill a black house of worship in post-bellum rural Louisiana. And now.\"\nShe also reminded people that the parish had been the site of the deadly Opelousas massacre in 1868.\nSince Monday, her tweet has been shared more than 37,000 times as word spread all over social media. Influential figures like Hillary Clinton and CNN anchor Jake Tapper pushed the fundraising page to their followers.\n\"The rebuild of Notre-Dame will be well-funded,\" wrote journalist Yashar Ali, who donated $1,000 to the fund.\nOn Wednesday, total donations for the three churches passed $1m with more than 18,000 people donating. Later that evening, Ali tweeted the $1.8m goal had been reached, including $20,000 donated by model Chrissy Teigen.\n\"It shows that the church is not only fireproof, but it's also faith-proof,\" Pastor Mason Jack told local news channel News15. \"To get calls from New York, and across the country and to show love for our sister churches means a whole lot to us,\" he said.\nAll three of the Louisiana fires were started with gasoline and occurred around Opelousas, about 60 miles (100km) west of the state capital of Baton Rouge.\nHolden Matthews, 21, a son of a local police deputy was arrested over the fires and has now been charged with hate crimes. He pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Monday.\nDuring the search for a suspect, Governor John Bel Edwards said the attacks were a reminder \"of a very dark past of intimidation and fear\".",
