A Senate version of the new bill will be introduced in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The state of our healthcare system is absolutely atrocious,&rdquo; Rep.

For a week, their house became a weird tourist attraction, with people driving for hours to come take pictures and talk to the family.\nHomeowner Ken Jenkins said he initially wanted to hide the graffiti from his two sons, age 3 and 9. But he decided that seeing hate sprayed all over their family home would be educational \u2014 if painful.\n\u201cYou won't change anything if you don't [show it to them],\u201d he said. \u201cHow would your son understand it later, when he deals with it?\u201d\nVICE News visited the family to ask how that conversation was going.\nThis segment originally aired March 12, 2019, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.",

Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning.</p>\n<p>Investigators are seeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/deutsche-bank-trump-finances-congress.html\">The New York Times reported</a>, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests.</p>\n<p>The subpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump&rsquo;s money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State. Collectively, investigators are now seeking a wide range of documents related to Trump&rsquo;s finances, including banking records, personal and business tax returns and corporate insurance records. The German lender has already been subpoenaed by New York&rsquo;s Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>\n<p>Schiff said Deutsche has been &ldquo;cooperative&rdquo; with the probe being run by the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Deutsche Bank is engaged in a productive dialogue with the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees,&rdquo; Deutsche spokesperson Kerrie McHugh told VICE News in an emailed statement Tuesday morning. &ldquo;We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/nrJDKO9?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>That could pose problems for the president. The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump&rsquo;s business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/deutsche-bank-trump-finances-congress.html\">reportedly lent</a> Trump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Congressional investigators are also seeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/politics/deutsche-bank-subpoena/index.html\">CNN reported Tuesday morning</a>, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests.</p>\n<p>President Trump&rsquo;s son Eric slammed the bank subpoenas as an &ldquo;unprecedented abuse of power,&rdquo; motivated by politics.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Instead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father&rsquo;s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments,&rdquo; Eric Trump said in a statement to VICE News. &ldquo;This incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected president.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But House Democrats say they&rsquo;re worried about the national security implications of Trump&rsquo;s potential ties to foreign money.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We want to know if the president or anyone in his family is financially compromised,&rdquo; Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee, said on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/04/16/house-committees-subpoena-deutsche-bank-trump-finances-swalwell-ac360-sot-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/ac360-videos/\">CNN late Monday</a>. &ldquo;Not just to the Russians, because we shouldn&rsquo;t assume he&rsquo;s faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below the standard of conduct that we would accept.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Deutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionable stock trades.</p>\n<p>Deutsche isn&rsquo;t the only aspect of Trump&rsquo;s finances facing scrutiny. The New York State Department of Financial Services, has sought records from Trump&rsquo;s longtime insurance broker, Aon. The House Oversight Committee is seeking years worth of records from Trump&rsquo;s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA,<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/trump-financial-records-1275965\"> according to Politico</a>. And the House Ways &amp; Means Committee submitted a formal request to the IRS for Trump&rsquo;s tax returns, with a deadline of April 23.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/8JBlXmU?img=1&lazy=1&v=1&app=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/8JBlXmU/thumbnail\"></img></figure>\n<p><i>Cover: </i><i>President Donald Trump speaks at Nuss Truck and Equipment in Burnsville, Minn., Monday, April 15, 2019.

Sign up here.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats may be waiting to see Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s final report like the rest of us, but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from pursuing other investigations into President Trump\u2019s finances.\nTwo House committees sent a subpoena for records on Monday to Trump\u2019s longtime lender of choice, the German financial giant Deutsche Bank, along with multiple other financial institutions as part of an investigation into foreign influence on U.S. politics, Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who chairs the House Intel committee, told VICE News Tuesday morning.\nInvestigators are seeking documents related to possible money-laundering by people in Russia and Eastern Europe, The New York Times reported, citing three unidentified people with knowledge of the requests.\nThe subpoenas mark a new front in the investigations into Trump\u2019s money, which are being led by multiple House committees and investigative bodies based in New York State. Collectively, investigators are now seeking a wide range of documents related to Trump\u2019s finances, including banking records, personal and business tax returns and corporate insurance records. The German lender has already been subpoenaed by New York\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office.\nSchiff said Deutsche has been \u201ccooperative\u201d with the probe being run by the House Intelligence Committee and House Financial Services Committee.\n\u201cDeutsche Bank is engaged in a productive dialogue with the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees,\u201d Deutsche spokesperson Kerrie McHugh told VICE News in an emailed statement Tuesday morning. \u201cWe remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations.\u201d\nThat could pose problems for the president. The firm is believed to hold a vast and detailed trove of information about Trump\u2019s business empire, thanks to its longstanding lending relationship with his family business. The bank has reportedly lent Trump a total of more than $2 billion over the years, even after other big Wall Street firms labeled him too risky to touch after a series of bankruptcies in the 1990s.\nCongressional investigators are also seeking records from JP Morgan and Citigroup, CNN reported Tuesday morning, citing unidentified people familiar with the requests.\nPresident Trump\u2019s son Eric slammed the bank subpoenas as an \u201cunprecedented abuse of power,\u201d motivated by politics.\n\u201cInstead of legislating, the committee is obsessed with harassing and undermining my father\u2019s administration, doing everything they can to distract from his incredible accomplishments,\u201d Eric Trump said in a statement to VICE News. \u201cThis incompetence is the exact reason why the American people have such disdain for politicians and why my father was elected president.\u201d\nBut House Democrats say they\u2019re worried about the national security implications of Trump\u2019s potential ties to foreign money.\n\u201cWe want to know if the president or anyone in his family is financially compromised,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN late Monday. \u201cNot just to the Russians, because we shouldn\u2019t assume he\u2019s faithful to them. He has worked with the Saudis, with other countries, in ways that are certainly, I think, below the standard of conduct that we would accept.\u201d\nDeutsche has had its own controversial history with helping to move Russian money around the world. In January 2017, the bank was fined $630 million by regulators in New York and London for allowing clients of its Moscow office to launder $10 billion out of Russia through questionable stock trades.\nDeutsche isn\u2019t the only aspect of Trump\u2019s finances facing scrutiny. The New York State Department of Financial Services, has sought records from Trump\u2019s longtime insurance broker, Aon. The House Oversight Committee is seeking years worth of records from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, according to Politico. And the House Ways & Means Committee submitted a formal request to the IRS for Trump\u2019s tax returns, with a deadline of April 23.\nCover: President Donald Trump speaks at Nuss Truck and Equipment in Burnsville, Minn., Monday, April 15, 2019.

Part of the $8 billion in funding he&rsquo;s seeking through the end-run around Congress would come from the budgets of other agencies, like the U.S. military.</p>\n<p>At least 13 Republicans voted to block the declaration, and 5 House members didn't vote.</p>\n<p>The resolution now heads to the Senate, and it will have to go to a vote in the next few weeks due to rules within the National Emergencies Act, then would have to be approved by President Trump if it garners a simple majority. Congress could also achieve a two-thirds majority to override Trump&rsquo;s eventual veto, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregorykorte/status/1100458039977619458\">which the White House has guaranteed.</a> That majority seems unlikely since the Senate is controlled by Republicans, but a few have already indicated they&rsquo;d vote with the Dems: Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they agree with their colleagues across the aisle that Trump&rsquo;s action represents an unconstitutional power grab.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This will allow a president to sideline Congress for much of domestic policy,&rdquo; Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, said ahead of his vote to oppose the national declaration on Tuesday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear there&rsquo;s no emergency at the border.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Apart from the national emergency declaration potentially being a Constitutional issue, other Democrats have raised concerns there&rsquo;s racist intent behind it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When all other labels have failed to achieve his central campaign promise to build a medieval border wall, he calls people like me a national emergency,&rdquo; Rep. Jesus Garcia, a Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor.</p>\n<p>House Republicans, meanwhile, pressured their colleagues Tuesday to vote against the measure because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s about defeating President Trump,&rdquo; said Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican of North Carolina.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Texas knows something others in this chamber apparently don&rsquo;t know: We are at war on the southern border with drug cartels from Mexico,&rdquo; Rep. Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said in urging others to vote against the measure.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope our great Republican senators don&rsquo;t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don&rsquo;t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don&rsquo;t fall into the Democrats &lsquo;trap&rsquo; of Open Borders and Crime!&rdquo; Trump wrote in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100017237228949506\">tweet on Monday.</a></p>\n<p>Trump announced the emergency declaration <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/bjq7aa/9-of-the-most-bizarre-moments-from-trumps-rambling-border-wall-press-conference\">during a bizarre Rose Garden press conference e</a>arlier this month, in which he struck a fearmongering tone and falsely said drugs were being smuggled across the border -- the fact is they actually arrive through legal ports of entry. Trump also managed to undercut his own argument when he said he didn&rsquo;t have to declare a national emergency on the border.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn't need to do this, but I&rsquo;d rather do it much faster,&rdquo; Trump said, referring to getting the funding he wanted.</p>\n<p>The national emergency declaration is also facing intense opposition on other fronts. Attorneys general in 16 states including liberal strongholds like New York and California have filed a lawsuit opposing the declaration and saying it threatens their states&rsquo; funding. And on Monday, 59 former national security advisers wrote a bipartisan letter to say there isn&rsquo;t a national emergency on the border.</p>\n<p><i>Cover: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks about the resolution to block President Donald Trump's emergency border security declaration on Capitol Hill, Monday, Feb. 25, 2019, in Washington.

                "text": "The House of Representatives just voted decisively to block President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration to fund his long-promised southern border wall.\nA resolution written by House Democrats passed 245-182 Tuesday evening, as expected, in a rebuke to Trump\u2019s Feb. 15 declaration of executive power after he failed to get the $5.7 billion he wanted through congressional appropriation bills, even after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. Part of the $8 billion in funding he\u2019s seeking through the end-run around Congress would come from the budgets of other agencies, like the U.S. military.\nAt least 13 Republicans voted to block the declaration, and 5 House members didn't vote.\nThe resolution now heads to the Senate, and it will have to go to a vote in the next few weeks due to rules within the National Emergencies Act, then would have to be approved by President Trump if it garners a simple majority. Congress could also achieve a two-thirds majority to override Trump\u2019s eventual veto, which the White House has guaranteed. That majority seems unlikely since the Senate is controlled by Republicans, but a few have already indicated they\u2019d vote with the Dems: Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have said they agree with their colleagues across the aisle that Trump\u2019s action represents an unconstitutional power grab.\n\u201cThis will allow a president to sideline Congress for much of domestic policy,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, said ahead of his vote to oppose the national declaration on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s no emergency at the border.\u201d\nApart from the national emergency declaration potentially being a Constitutional issue, other Democrats have raised concerns there\u2019s racist intent behind it.\n\u201cWhen all other labels have failed to achieve his central campaign promise to build a medieval border wall, he calls people like me a national emergency,\u201d Rep. Jesus Garcia, a Democrat of Illinois, said on the House floor.\nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, pressured their colleagues Tuesday to vote against the measure because \u201cit\u2019s about defeating President Trump,\u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican of North Carolina.\n\u201cTexas knows something others in this chamber apparently don\u2019t know: We are at war on the southern border with drug cartels from Mexico,\u201d Rep. Pete Olson, a Texas Republican, said in urging others to vote against the measure.\n\u201cI hope our great Republican senators don\u2019t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security. Without strong Borders, we don\u2019t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don\u2019t fall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019 of Open Borders and Crime!\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet on Monday.\nTrump announced the emergency declaration during a bizarre Rose Garden press conference earlier this month, in which he struck a fearmongering tone and falsely said drugs were being smuggled across the border -- the fact is they actually arrive through legal ports of entry. Trump also managed to undercut his own argument when he said he didn\u2019t have to declare a national emergency on the border.\n\u201cI didn't need to do this, but I\u2019d rather do it much faster,\u201d Trump said, referring to getting the funding he wanted.\nThe national emergency declaration is also facing intense opposition on other fronts. Attorneys general in 16 states including liberal strongholds like New York and California have filed a lawsuit opposing the declaration and saying it threatens their states\u2019 funding. And on Monday, 59 former national security advisers wrote a bipartisan letter to say there isn\u2019t a national emergency on the border.\nCover: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks about the resolution to block President Donald Trump's emergency border security declaration on Capitol Hill, Monday, Feb. 25, 2019, in Washington.

And not one of them reported it to Facebook or the authorities, the social media company said Monday.</p>\n<p>Instead, one person who saw the video decided to upload it to a file-sharing site and posted a link for anyone to download on 8chan, which is how the 17-minute video was able to be shared so widely on social networks in the aftermath of the shooting.</p>\n<p>In an update posted Monday, Facebook <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/update-on-new-zealand/\">said</a> the original video of the massacre was viewed about 4,000 times in total, including the roughly 200 live views it received, before it was taken down.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/03/update-on-new-zealand/\">first user report</a> on the original video came in 29 minutes after the video started, and 12 minutes after the live broadcast ended,&rdquo; said Chris Sonderby, Facebook&rsquo;s deputy general counsel.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Christchurch massacre, New Zealand has made it illegal to watch, possess, download or share the 17-minute video of the Christchurch terror attack under the country&rsquo;s Films, Videos &amp; Publications Classification Act, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/new-zealand-shooting-ardern-says-she-will-never-speak-suspects-name\">has vowed </a>that she would never speak the accused killer&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re aware that for a time after the attacks, this <a href=\"https://www.classificationoffice.govt.nz/news/latest-news/christchurch-shooting-video-officially-objectionable/\">video was widely available</a> on social media and many New Zealanders saw it, sometimes without meaning to,&rdquo; New Zealand Chief Censor David Shanks wrote.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important people are now clear they should not view, download or share the video,&rdquo; Shanks said.</p>\n<p>On Monday a teenager was charged in a Christchurch court charged with <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12213914\">sharing the live-stream online</a>, as well as posting a photograph of one of the mosques attacked with the message &ldquo;target acquired.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Both Facebook and YouTube <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/7xnjye/how-facebook-twitter-and-youtube-failed-to-keep-gruesome-mosque-shooting-video-from-going-viral\">struggled</a> to deal with the number of people trying to upload the video onto their sites last week.</p>\n<p>Facebook said it removed about 1.5 million videos of the attack globally in the first 24 hours, with more than 1.2 million of those blocked at upload. In a statement, YouTube said: &ldquo;The volume of related videos uploaded to YouTube in the 24 hours after the attack was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/facebook-and-youtube-defend-response-to-christchurch-videos\">unprecedented both in scale and speed</a> &ndash; at times as fast as a new upload every second.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To give a sense of the scale of the problem facing these platforms, Facebook said it had shared 800 visually-distinct videos of the massacre to a shared database maintained by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.</p>\n<p>Despite the steps taken by the tech giants to combat the spread of these videos, lawmakers say they are simply not doing enough.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,&rdquo; Ardern said on Tuesday. &ldquo;They are the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i> Cover image: People mourn at a makeshift memorial site near the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, Tuesday, March 19, 2019.

                "text": "Almost 200 people watched in real time Friday as a terrorist live-streamed his shooting rampage at two New Zealand mosques that left 50 people dead. And not one of them reported it to Facebook or the authorities, the social media company said Monday.\nInstead, one person who saw the video decided to upload it to a file-sharing site and posted a link for anyone to download on 8chan, which is how the 17-minute video was able to be shared so widely on social networks in the aftermath of the shooting.\nIn an update posted Monday, Facebook said the original video of the massacre was viewed about 4,000 times in total, including the roughly 200 live views it received, before it was taken down.\n\u201cThe first user report on the original video came in 29 minutes after the video started, and 12 minutes after the live broadcast ended,\u201d said Chris Sonderby, Facebook\u2019s deputy general counsel.\nIn the wake of the Christchurch massacre, New Zealand has made it illegal to watch, possess, download or share the 17-minute video of the Christchurch terror attack under the country\u2019s Films, Videos & Publications Classification Act, and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed that she would never speak the accused killer\u2019s name.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware that for a time after the attacks, this video was widely available on social media and many New Zealanders saw it, sometimes without meaning to,\u201d New Zealand Chief Censor David Shanks wrote.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important people are now clear they should not view, download or share the video,\u201d Shanks said.\nOn Monday a teenager was charged in a Christchurch court charged with sharing the live-stream online, as well as posting a photograph of one of the mosques attacked with the message \u201ctarget acquired.\u201d\nBoth Facebook and YouTube struggled to deal with the number of people trying to upload the video onto their sites last week.\nFacebook said it removed about 1.5 million videos of the attack globally in the first 24 hours, with more than 1.2 million of those blocked at upload. In a statement, YouTube said: \u201cThe volume of related videos uploaded to YouTube in the 24 hours after the attack was unprecedented both in scale and speed \u2013 at times as fast as a new upload every second.\u201d\nTo give a sense of the scale of the problem facing these platforms, Facebook said it had shared 800 visually-distinct videos of the massacre to a shared database maintained by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.\nDespite the steps taken by the tech giants to combat the spread of these videos, lawmakers say they are simply not doing enough.\n\u201cWe cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,\u201d Ardern said on Tuesday. \u201cThey are the publisher, not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit, no responsibility.\u201d\nCover image: People mourn at a makeshift memorial site near the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, Tuesday, March 19, 2019.

Jaballah is Masjid Al Noor&rsquo;s facilities manager, and he thought to himself, as he prayed, that this would just be another quick fix.</p>\n<p>Then the second gunshot rang out, accompanied by shouts of &ldquo;Allahu Akbar, la ilaha illa Allah<i> &rdquo; &mdash; </i>God is great, there is no God but Allah. Jaballah, his voice hoarse, said he later realized people were &ldquo;basically saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to die.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He fled the mosque and flung himself over a wall into a neighboring suburban garden, where he and several others hid as a gunman massacred 42 members of his mosque before driving to a second mosque about 3 miles away, where he killed more.</p>\n<p>Even as Friday&rsquo;s attack unfolded, Jaballah, 25, said he couldn&rsquo;t believe there was a gunman on the loose. This is New Zealand, after all; most years the country sees fewer than 10 people killed by guns. The carnage only registered when Jaballah used his scarf to dress a friend&rsquo;s wound. When the police arrived, he walked out onto the street and saw the body of a woman on the ground under a blanket, and a man he knew carrying his dead 4-year-old son. The friend he had driven to the mosque with had also been killed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I thought, there&rsquo;s no way. There&rsquo;s no way in New Zealand he would get ahold of a gun and he would be killing people. That stuff happens in America &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t happen here,&rdquo; the Yemen-born mechanical engineer said on Sunday, sitting on the grass near a crisis center set up at Hagley Community College.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To have our two mosques go from mosques to morgues; the depth and intensity of the feeling that people are having is profound.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now, Jaballah is among the millions of New Zealanders reeling in the aftermath of the island nation&rsquo;s deadliest terror attack, and questioning what this means for their country. New Zealand has long been seen as a progressive safe haven, but some Muslim leaders say the attack, allegedly carried about by an Australian, came amid increasing anti-Muslim sentiment. Masjid Al Noor itself was threatened by white supremacists in 2016.</p>\n<p>The Muslim community of Canterbury, the province home to Christchurch, is tiny and close-knit. They number just 3,000, according to Toshi Hodliffe, of the Canterbury Muslim Community Trust, in a country of about 50,000 Muslims. When the gunman stormed Al Noor and the Linwood Islamic Centre, killing 50 people, he massacred about 1.7 percent of Canterbury&rsquo;s Muslims.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No one in the community is untouched by this,&rdquo; said Hodliffe. &ldquo;Not a single soul. I mean, to have our two mosques go from mosques to morgues; the depth and intensity of the feeling that people are having is profound.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The first Muslims to settle in New Zealand were an Indian family that came to Christchurch in the 1850s. Masjid Al Noor opened its doors in 1985. Many waiting outside the crisis center for information on their slain family and friends described it as &ldquo;the heart&rdquo; of the city&rsquo;s Islamic community.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s where we take people, children when they are born, where we get married, where we have our funerals &mdash; it&rsquo;s the center of our community. It&rsquo;s sacred ground to us,&rdquo; said Hodliffe. She described Christchurch&rsquo;s community as &ldquo;hyper-diverse.&rdquo; According to the 2013 census, half of the New Zealand Muslim population was born in the country or elsewhere in the Pacific, while 27 percent were immigrants from Asia and 23 percent from the Middle East and Africa. Victims included New Zealanders, Pakistanis, Palestinians, Syrians, Indians, Fijians, Iraqis, and others.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have received racist comments. My mother who wears a headscarf has received racist comments.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the days since the shooting, many of New Zealand&rsquo;s Muslim leaders have expressed anger. Anjum Rahman, in an <a href=\"https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/384911/islamic-women-s-council-repeatedly-lobbied-to-stem-discrimination\">article for Radio New Zealand</a>, wrote that her organization, the Islamic Women&rsquo;s Council of New Zealand, had in recent years repeatedly and fruitlessly lobbied the country&rsquo;s intelligence services and government agencies to act on what she said is a rising tide of vitriol aimed at Muslims, both online and in person. Some government ministers have <a href=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2019/03/18/493288/time-to-recall-mps-anti-migrant-rhetoric\">come under scrutiny</a> for anti-immigrant messaging.</p>\n<p>The alleged shooter, 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant, is from Australia. He wasn&rsquo;t a Christchurch resident; Tarrant, who has been charged with murder, allegedly drove from more than 200 miles away to carry out the attacks. Hodliffe said that non-Muslim Christchurch residents have generally been &ldquo;open-hearted and usually curious.&rdquo; But she added that the city&rsquo;s Muslims had experienced threats from white supremacists and neo-Nazis.</p>\n<p>In 2016, a local white supremacist <a href=\"https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12214191\">delivered pig heads</a> to Masjid Al Noor, saying, &ldquo;Bring on the cull.&rdquo; Hodliffe said she has been the target of anti-Muslim taunts on the streets. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those things that&rsquo;s hard to talk about, and just becomes normalized, so people don&rsquo;t talk about it any more,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is really weird and challenging for people to be told to go home to their own country, to not be included, to not feel part of the community.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Green Party member of Parliament Golriz Gharhraman, who herself has been the target of racial abuse and death threats, told VICE News that quantifying this rise in hate speech was very difficult, given the vagueness of New Zealand&rsquo;s legislation. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t really have hate-speech laws. We don&rsquo;t really have protections for most minorities, and even when we do, it&rsquo;s a vague term, &lsquo;racial disharmony&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the ground in Christchurch, in these early days, there&rsquo;s more shock that this could happen here than belief that the attack was the result of an increasingly dangerous environment for Muslims. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re living in New Zealand,&rdquo; Jaballah says, &ldquo;you always feel safe. The flat I moved into, I had to install a deadbolt for them &mdash; they&rsquo;d never locked their house for the past six years.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hassan Raslan, 30, said he and his family, who are Egyptian and immigrated to New Zealand 23 years ago, have also been the target of racist comments. Raslan, who is from Auckland, flew to Christchurch on Saturday to volunteer at the crisis center, transporting resources and people around the city.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It really has shocked us a lot,&rdquo; Raslan said, sitting on a park bench outside on the community college grounds. &ldquo;But the surprise isn&rsquo;t as much given that you could see this kind of racism or hate kind of brewing. You could see it all over the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He loves New Zealand, but his personal experience with the country haven&rsquo;t always been positive. &ldquo;I have received racist comments. My mother, who wears a headscarf, has received racist comments. Anyone who has a sister who wears a headscarf would know that they experience this as well; it&rsquo;s all part of living here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;where to now?&rsquo; &mdash; we&rsquo;re not ready to think about it. You know, we&rsquo;ve got 50 people to bury.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And dread, he said, has now overtaken the local Muslim community. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an increased fear for our sisters and for our mothers and everybody who is identifiable as a Muslim,&rdquo; Raslan said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another fear that this has given a kind of license to the more undercover racists or extremists to do what they wanted to do. Unfortunately, this person&rsquo;s views are shared by some other sick individuals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For both Jaballah and Hodliffe, imagining how Christchurch&rsquo;s Muslim community will heal is still impossible. Both are helping to lead the response, which has been especially painful because the scale of the tragedy is so large, and the community is so small.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so difficult, especially the people who have, like, nine friends of theirs wiped out. Just like that,&rdquo; said Jaballah, snapping his fingers. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t think straight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hodliffe said that right now, community members are focused on getting through each day and supporting each other, with little thought to the future. That will come later.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;where to now?&rsquo; &mdash; we&rsquo;re not ready to think about it. You know, we&rsquo;ve got 50 people to bury.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><i>Cover: People pray next to flowers and tributes near Al Noor mosque on March 19, 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

                "text": "CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand \u2014 When the first gunshot punctured the peace of the mosque, Aymen Jaballah thought it was just some electrical mundanity \u2014 a blown light bulb, perhaps. Jaballah is Masjid Al Noor\u2019s facilities manager, and he thought to himself, as he prayed, that this would just be another quick fix.\nThen the second gunshot rang out, accompanied by shouts of \u201cAllahu Akbar, la ilaha illa Allah \u201d \u2014 God is great, there is no God but Allah. Jaballah, his voice hoarse, said he later realized people were \u201cbasically saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to die.\u2019\u201d\nHe fled the mosque and flung himself over a wall into a neighboring suburban garden, where he and several others hid as a gunman massacred 42 members of his mosque before driving to a second mosque about 3 miles away, where he killed more.\nEven as Friday\u2019s attack unfolded, Jaballah, 25, said he couldn\u2019t believe there was a gunman on the loose. This is New Zealand, after all; most years the country sees fewer than 10 people killed by guns. The carnage only registered when Jaballah used his scarf to dress a friend\u2019s wound. When the police arrived, he walked out onto the street and saw the body of a woman on the ground under a blanket, and a man he knew carrying his dead 4-year-old son. The friend he had driven to the mosque with had also been killed.\n\u201cI thought, there\u2019s no way. There\u2019s no way in New Zealand he would get ahold of a gun and he would be killing people. That stuff happens in America \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen here,\u201d the Yemen-born mechanical engineer said on Sunday, sitting on the grass near a crisis center set up at Hagley Community College.\n\u201cTo have our two mosques go from mosques to morgues; the depth and intensity of the feeling that people are having is profound.\u201d\nNow, Jaballah is among the millions of New Zealanders reeling in the aftermath of the island nation\u2019s deadliest terror attack, and questioning what this means for their country. New Zealand has long been seen as a progressive safe haven, but some Muslim leaders say the attack, allegedly carried about by an Australian, came amid increasing anti-Muslim sentiment. Masjid Al Noor itself was threatened by white supremacists in 2016.\nThe Muslim community of Canterbury, the province home to Christchurch, is tiny and close-knit. They number just 3,000, according to Toshi Hodliffe, of the Canterbury Muslim Community Trust, in a country of about 50,000 Muslims. When the gunman stormed Al Noor and the Linwood Islamic Centre, killing 50 people, he massacred about 1.7 percent of Canterbury\u2019s Muslims.\n\u201cNo one in the community is untouched by this,\u201d said Hodliffe. \u201cNot a single soul. I mean, to have our two mosques go from mosques to morgues; the depth and intensity of the feeling that people are having is profound.\u201d\nThe first Muslims to settle in New Zealand were an Indian family that came to Christchurch in the 1850s. Masjid Al Noor opened its doors in 1985. Many waiting outside the crisis center for information on their slain family and friends described it as \u201cthe heart\u201d of the city\u2019s Islamic community.\n\u201cIt\u2019s where we take people, children when they are born, where we get married, where we have our funerals \u2014 it\u2019s the center of our community. It\u2019s sacred ground to us,\u201d said Hodliffe. She described Christchurch\u2019s community as \u201chyper-diverse.\u201d According to the 2013 census, half of the New Zealand Muslim population was born in the country or elsewhere in the Pacific, while 27 percent were immigrants from Asia and 23 percent from the Middle East and Africa. Victims included New Zealanders, Pakistanis, Palestinians, Syrians, Indians, Fijians, Iraqis, and others.\n\u201cI have received racist comments. My mother who wears a headscarf has received racist comments.\u201d\nIn the days since the shooting, many of New Zealand\u2019s Muslim leaders have expressed anger. Anjum Rahman, in an article for Radio New Zealand, wrote that her organization, the Islamic Women\u2019s Council of New Zealand, had in recent years repeatedly and fruitlessly lobbied the country\u2019s intelligence services and government agencies to act on what she said is a rising tide of vitriol aimed at Muslims, both online and in person. Some government ministers have come under scrutiny for anti-immigrant messaging.\nThe alleged shooter, 28-year-old Brenton Tarrant, is from Australia. He wasn\u2019t a Christchurch resident; Tarrant, who has been charged with murder, allegedly drove from more than 200 miles away to carry out the attacks. Hodliffe said that non-Muslim Christchurch residents have generally been \u201copen-hearted and usually curious.\u201d But she added that the city\u2019s Muslims had experienced threats from white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\nIn 2016, a local white supremacist delivered pig heads to Masjid Al Noor, saying, \u201cBring on the cull.\u201d Hodliffe said she has been the target of anti-Muslim taunts on the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s hard to talk about, and just becomes normalized, so people don\u2019t talk about it any more,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is really weird and challenging for people to be told to go home to their own country, to not be included, to not feel part of the community.\u201d\nGreen Party member of Parliament Golriz Gharhraman, who herself has been the target of racial abuse and death threats, told VICE News that quantifying this rise in hate speech was very difficult, given the vagueness of New Zealand\u2019s legislation. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have hate-speech laws. We don\u2019t really have protections for most minorities, and even when we do, it\u2019s a vague term, \u2018racial disharmony\u2019.\u201d\nOn the ground in Christchurch, in these early days, there\u2019s more shock that this could happen here than belief that the attack was the result of an increasingly dangerous environment for Muslims. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living in New Zealand,\u201d Jaballah says, \u201cyou always feel safe. The flat I moved into, I had to install a deadbolt for them \u2014 they\u2019d never locked their house for the past six years.\u201d\nHassan Raslan, 30, said he and his family, who are Egyptian and immigrated to New Zealand 23 years ago, have also been the target of racist comments. Raslan, who is from Auckland, flew to Christchurch on Saturday to volunteer at the crisis center, transporting resources and people around the city.\n\u201cIt really has shocked us a lot,\u201d Raslan said, sitting on a park bench outside on the community college grounds. \u201cBut the surprise isn\u2019t as much given that you could see this kind of racism or hate kind of brewing. You could see it all over the world.\u201d\nHe loves New Zealand, but his personal experience with the country haven\u2019t always been positive. \u201cI have received racist comments. My mother, who wears a headscarf, has received racist comments. Anyone who has a sister who wears a headscarf would know that they experience this as well; it\u2019s all part of living here.\u201d\n\u201cThe \u2018where to now?\u2019 \u2014 we\u2019re not ready to think about it. You know, we\u2019ve got 50 people to bury.\u201d\nAnd dread, he said, has now overtaken the local Muslim community. \u201cThere\u2019s an increased fear for our sisters and for our mothers and everybody who is identifiable as a Muslim,\u201d Raslan said. \u201cThere\u2019s another fear that this has given a kind of license to the more undercover racists or extremists to do what they wanted to do. Unfortunately, this person\u2019s views are shared by some other sick individuals.\u201d\nFor both Jaballah and Hodliffe, imagining how Christchurch\u2019s Muslim community will heal is still impossible. Both are helping to lead the response, which has been especially painful because the scale of the tragedy is so large, and the community is so small.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so difficult, especially the people who have, like, nine friends of theirs wiped out. Just like that,\u201d said Jaballah, snapping his fingers. \u201cThey can\u2019t think straight.\u201d\nHodliffe said that right now, community members are focused on getting through each day and supporting each other, with little thought to the future. That will come later.\n\u201cThe \u2018where to now?\u2019 \u2014 we\u2019re not ready to think about it. You know, we\u2019ve got 50 people to bury.\u201d\nCover: People pray next to flowers and tributes near Al Noor mosque on March 19, 2019 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, wrote on Twitter. &ldquo;Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll remain faithful when you&rsquo;re in prison. She&rsquo;s about to learn a lot&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gaetz, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, is not on the House Oversight Committee, but nonetheless his tweet sparked an immediate backlash, with critics expressing disbelief that he would taunt or threaten a witness who's about to testify, and a law blog suggesting he might have violated the law.</p>\n<p>In a statement to VICE News, Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for Michael Cohen, said his client would &quot;not respond to Mr. Gaetz&rsquo;s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct.&quot;</p>\n<p>Cohen previously postponed his congressional testimony, originally slated for Feb. 7, due to numerous threats against him and his family. &quot;Due to ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and [Trump's lawyer] Mr. Giuliani, as recently as this weekend, as well as Mr. Cohen's continued cooperation with ongoing investigations, by advice of counsel, Mr. Cohen's appearance will be postponed to a later date,&quot; Davis said in a <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/nexw87/michael-cohen-postpones-congressional-testimony-because-of-trump-threats\">statement </a>on Jan. 23.</p>\n<p>Cohen, who will start a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion in May, and has already been convicted for lying to Congress once, is expected to spill the beans on his former employer Donald Trump in a big way.</p>\n<p>Reports <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/j57b5d/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-michael-cohens-testimony-on-trumps-dirty-deeds\">published Tuesday </a>citing sources familiar with the matter suggested that Cohen may accuse Trump of crimes, and also discuss moments where the president lied or used racist language.</p>\n<p>Former Director of United States Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub replied to Gaetz&rsquo;s tweet with a link to the federal witness tampering statute.</p>\n<p>But Gaetz shrugged off any suggestion that he was &ldquo;witness tampering.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m witness testing,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexWardVox/status/1100511048044564485\">told</a> Vox&rsquo;s Alex Ward. &ldquo;We are still allowed to test the veracity and character of witnesses, I think.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time Cohen has face veiled or explicit threats from Trump and his backers. Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have both made statements about Cohen&rsquo;s family that could be seen as witness tampering, <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/9kpwna/trumps-threats-against-cohens-family-look-a-lot-like-witness-tampering-former-prosecutors-say\">former prosecutors have told VICE News</a>.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/8PJMuUU?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><i>Cover image: Rep.

                "text": "A sitting U.S. congressman took to social media Tuesday evening to issue a jeering \u2014 and possibly threatening \u2014 statement directed at former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who is due to testify publicly before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\u201cHey @MichaelCohen212,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, wrote on Twitter. \u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot\u2026\u201d\nGaetz, a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump, is not on the House Oversight Committee, but nonetheless his tweet sparked an immediate backlash, with critics expressing disbelief that he would taunt or threaten a witness who's about to testify, and a law blog suggesting he might have violated the law.\nIn a statement to VICE News, Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for Michael Cohen, said his client would \"not respond to Mr. Gaetz\u2019s despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct.\"\nCohen previously postponed his congressional testimony, originally slated for Feb. 7, due to numerous threats against him and his family. \"Due to ongoing threats against his family from President Trump and [Trump's lawyer] Mr. Giuliani, as recently as this weekend, as well as Mr. Cohen's continued cooperation with ongoing investigations, by advice of counsel, Mr. Cohen's appearance will be postponed to a later date,\" Davis said in a statement on Jan. 23.\nCohen, who will start a three-year prison sentence for tax evasion in May, and has already been convicted for lying to Congress once, is expected to spill the beans on his former employer Donald Trump in a big way.\nReports published Tuesday citing sources familiar with the matter suggested that Cohen may accuse Trump of crimes, and also discuss moments where the president lied or used racist language.\nFormer Director of United States Office of Government Ethics Walter Shaub replied to Gaetz\u2019s tweet with a link to the federal witness tampering statute.\nBut Gaetz shrugged off any suggestion that he was \u201cwitness tampering.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m witness testing,\u201d he told Vox\u2019s Alex Ward. \u201cWe are still allowed to test the veracity and character of witnesses, I think.\u201d\nThis isn't the first time Cohen has face veiled or explicit threats from Trump and his backers. Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani have both made statements about Cohen\u2019s family that could be seen as witness tampering, former prosecutors have told VICE News.\nCover image: Rep.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to put a stop to that.</p>\n<p>The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate announced at a CNN town hall on Monday that she wants to abolish the Electoral College, a process that decides elections through 538 electoral votes doled out to each state based on population &mdash; rather than a true &ldquo;one person, one vote&rdquo; methodology. Every state carries an electoral vote for each of its House and Senate seats in Congress. That means a handful of populous swing states &mdash; like Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin &mdash; usually decide elections.</p>\n<p>The system has drawn criticism for allowing Donald Trump to become president in 2016 even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. In 2000, the same happened to Al Gore, who sued over a recount of the final electoral votes, which belonged to Florida. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, ultimately ruled in George W. Bush&rsquo;s favor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College,&rdquo; Warren said, which triggered enormous applause at the town hall.</p>\n<p>Trump, however, appears split on the issue.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/pBDr45B?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe data-iframely-smart-iframe=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://oembed.vice.com/vJOgKO0?app=1&lazy=1&v=1\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Warren held the event in Mississippi, where she noted that Democratic presidential candidates almost never campaign because the state reliably votes Republican and isn&rsquo;t a battleground for Electoral College votes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and makes sure that vote gets counted,&rdquo; Warren said. &ldquo;We need to put some federal muscle behind that, and we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>States have already started to take matters into their own hands. Last Friday, Colorado <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/12-states-dc-change-electoral-college-works-850f4eb4-b320-48c9-bccd-6002afdc38db.html\">became the 12th state along with Washington, D.C., </a>to join a pact to allocate all of its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote &mdash; though the pact will only take effect if enough states join that the electoral college votes they represent total at least 270. (Right now, the number stands at 181.)</p>\n<p>As one of many Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, Warren has attempted to set herself apart by pushing bold, fleshed-out policy ideas, like <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/yw8kdm/elizabeth-warren-plans-to-break-up-amazon-facebook-and-google\">breaking up the biggest tech companies</a> and implementing <a href=\"https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/nexvdd/elizabeth-warren-wants-a-yearly-wealth-tax-on-americas-hyper-rich-report-says\">a yearly wealth tax on America&rsquo;s uber-rich</a>. She&rsquo;s the first candidate to explicitly call for the elimination of the Electoral College, though Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/311097-sanders-calls-for-change-to-electoral-college-as-electors-cast-votes\">previously said</a> the body should &ldquo;change.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Warren also said a constitutional amendment should deal with voter suppression in the United States, which disproportionately affects low-income communities of color, and that she would create a group to study the implementation of reparations for the descendants of slaves.</p>\n<p><i>Cover image: Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

That means a handful of populous swing states \u2014 like Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 usually decide elections.\nThe system has drawn criticism for allowing Donald Trump to become president in 2016 even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. In 2000, the same happened to Al Gore, who sued over a recount of the final electoral votes, which belonged to Florida. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, ultimately ruled in George W. Bush\u2019s favor.\n\u201cEvery vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College,\u201d Warren said, which triggered enormous applause at the town hall.\nTrump, however, appears split on the issue.\nWarren held the event in Mississippi, where she noted that Democratic presidential candidates almost never campaign because the state reliably votes Republican and isn\u2019t a battleground for Electoral College votes.\n\u201cI believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and makes sure that vote gets counted,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to put some federal muscle behind that, and we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there.\u201d\nStates have already started to take matters into their own hands. Last Friday, Colorado became the 12th state along with Washington, D.C., to join a pact to allocate all of its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote \u2014 though the pact will only take effect if enough states join that the electoral college votes they represent total at least 270. (Right now, the number stands at 181.)\nAs one of many Democratic 2020 presidential candidates, Warren has attempted to set herself apart by pushing bold, fleshed-out policy ideas, like breaking up the biggest tech companies and implementing a yearly wealth tax on America\u2019s uber-rich. She\u2019s the first candidate to explicitly call for the elimination of the Electoral College, though Bernie Sanders previously said the body should \u201cchange.\u201d\nWarren also said a constitutional amendment should deal with voter suppression in the United States, which disproportionately affects low-income communities of color, and that she would create a group to study the implementation of reparations for the descendants of slaves.\nCover image: Democratic presidential candidate Sen.

Not so much.</p>\n<p>Under the current iteration of the agreement, described to me by three people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, the US would agree to lift some sanctions on North Korea and improve ties between the two countries in exchange for a commitment from Kim Jong Un to close down a key nuclear facility.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s the outline of the tentative deal as described to me:</p>\n<ol> <li>Both countries will sign a peace declaration to symbolically end the Korean War. That conflict ended in an armistice (basically a truce), not an actual peace treaty, in 1953, which means the war is technically still ongoing. The agreement would effectively, although not officially, end hostilities between the two countries and dramatically improve their relations.</li> <li>North Korea will agree to return more remains of US troops who died during the Korean War, although it&rsquo;s unclear how many of the <a href=\"https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/military/fallen-and-forgotten/7000-still-missing-from-korean-war-trump-summit-may-restart-search-to-find-them/65-564163802\">thousands</a> will come home and when. Last year, following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, North Korea returned the remains of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/27/17621448/north-korea-trump-remains-55-war\">55 American service members</a>.</li> <li>The US and North Korea will establish <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/18/18229459/north-korea-usa-trump-kim-embassy\">liaison offices</a> &mdash; which are quasi-embassies with minimal authorities &mdash; in each other&rsquo;s nations. That will be the first concrete step toward normalizing diplomatic ties between the two longtime enemies.</li> <li>North Korea will agree to stop producing materials for nuclear bombs at its Yongbyon facility. In exchange, the US will push to lift some UN sanctions on Pyongyang so it can pursue joint economic projects with South Korea. It&rsquo;s also possible the deal will include some other nuclear facilities, one source said.</li> </ol>\n<p>Again, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that this tentative deal will change &mdash; perhaps even dramatically &mdash; between now and when Trump and Kim meet on February 27 in Vietnam. But the deal as it currently stands comports with what many expected heading into the summit.</p>\n<p>In other words, it isn&rsquo;t a major surprise that this is the deal on offer. The problem, though, is that Trump may be giving more than he&rsquo;s getting.</p>\n<h3>Why this deal is both good and bad for Trump</h3>\n<p>If agreed to, the most controversial part of this deal will be the promise from Kim to shutter the Yongbyon facility in exchange for some modest sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s why: The people familiar with the current deal say there are no specific details and no timetable for how North Korea will end nuclear fuel production at the Yongbyon facility. Instead, Trump and Kim will agree in principle to the closure and working-level staff will finalize the details in future talks.</p>\n<p>The Yongbyon nuclear facility is &ldquo;the heart of [North Korea&rsquo;s] nuclear program,&rdquo; a top expert <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-koreas-yongbyon-nuclear-complex-at-the-heart-of-trump-kim-summit/2019/02/22/ee99269a-352d-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html?utm_term=.236e1625f93e\">told the Washington Post</a> last week. It&rsquo;s the only place (that we know of) where the country can make plutonium for nuclear bombs. If it shuts down, Pyongyang&rsquo;s ability to make plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons will be severely curtailed.</p>\n<p>That wouldn&rsquo;t mean the end of its nuclear program &mdash; not by a long shot &mdash; but it would be a concrete gesture that would help signal that Kim may actually be serious about dismantling the program eventually.</p>\n<p>That said, it&rsquo;s one thing for Kim to say he&rsquo;ll close the facility, and another thing entirely for him to actually do so.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Hersman, a nuclear expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me that for this to be a real concession, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/25/18236174/north-korea-trump-kim-vietnam-nuclear\">Kim would have to let international inspectors into the facility to verify</a> that nuclear material production had really ended. Without those inspections, there&rsquo;s no way to know if Kim has followed through on his promise.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a move the leader may be reluctant to take. And even if he did so, he could always just restart the shuttered facility once the inspectors left &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-koreas-yongbyon-nuclear-complex-at-the-heart-of-trump-kim-summit/2019/02/22/ee99269a-352d-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5e6c180a8c69\">as his father, Kim Jong Il, did twice before, after deals with the US collapsed</a>.</p>\n<p>That, in part, is why experts want any deal on closing Yongbyon to be extremely detailed. &ldquo;An agreement on the dismantlement of such a site has to be worded deliberately and concisely so technical experts can watch and verify each step in the process,&rdquo; said Grace Liu of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.</p>\n<p>But if Trump moves to lift sanctions before Kim actually ends all production at Yongbyon, he will have offered a major concession without getting anything substantive in return.</p>\n<p>The rest of the deal, however, looks pretty good.</p>\n<p>By signing a peace declaration, both sides will reduce tensions with one another by saying they are no longer warring enemies. By establishing liaison offices, Washington and Pyongyang will take an important step toward normalizing their relations. And by returning more troop remains to the US &mdash; something people close to the negotiations tell me is personally very important to Trump &mdash; North Korea will show it&rsquo;s serious about staying in America&rsquo;s good graces.</p>\n<p>So there&rsquo;s a lot to like in this potential deal. But it doesn&rsquo;t really move the needle much on the fundamental goal of denuclearizing North Korea, and mostly just rewards Kim with much-needed sanctions relief for doing little more than continuing to show up for talks and making some vague promises. It that sense, the deal isn&rsquo;t great for Trump but is a pretty big win for the North Korean leader.</p>\n<p>But if this serves as a building block to more deals down the line &mdash; leading North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program in the long run &mdash; then it&rsquo;s possible we&rsquo;ll all look back on Hanoi fondly in a few years&rsquo; time.</p>",

                "text": "Kevin Lim/The Straits Times/Handout/Getty Images\nA tentative deal between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be finalized over the next two days at their summit in Vietnam has emerged \u2014 and while it may still change, the current agreement looks like a huge win for Kim.\nFor the US? Not so much.\nUnder the current iteration of the agreement, described to me by three people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues, the US would agree to lift some sanctions on North Korea and improve ties between the two countries in exchange for a commitment from Kim Jong Un to close down a key nuclear facility.\nHere\u2019s the outline of the tentative deal as described to me:\nBoth countries will sign a peace declaration to symbolically end the Korean War. That conflict ended in an armistice (basically a truce), not an actual peace treaty, in 1953, which means the war is technically still ongoing. The agreement would effectively, although not officially, end hostilities between the two countries and dramatically improve their relations.\nNorth Korea will agree to return more remains of US troops who died during the Korean War, although it\u2019s unclear how many of the thousands will come home and when. Last year, following the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore, North Korea returned the remains of 55 American service members.\nThe US and North Korea will establish liaison offices \u2014 which are quasi-embassies with minimal authorities \u2014 in each other\u2019s nations. That will be the first concrete step toward normalizing diplomatic ties between the two longtime enemies.\nNorth Korea will agree to stop producing materials for nuclear bombs at its Yongbyon facility. In exchange, the US will push to lift some UN sanctions on Pyongyang so it can pursue joint economic projects with South Korea. It\u2019s also possible the deal will include some other nuclear facilities, one source said.\nAgain, it\u2019s entirely possible that this tentative deal will change \u2014 perhaps even dramatically \u2014 between now and when Trump and Kim meet on February 27 in Vietnam. But the deal as it currently stands comports with what many expected heading into the summit.\nIn other words, it isn\u2019t a major surprise that this is the deal on offer. The problem, though, is that Trump may be giving more than he\u2019s getting.\nWhy this deal is both good and bad for Trump\nIf agreed to, the most controversial part of this deal will be the promise from Kim to shutter the Yongbyon facility in exchange for some modest sanctions relief.\nHere\u2019s why: The people familiar with the current deal say there are no specific details and no timetable for how North Korea will end nuclear fuel production at the Yongbyon facility. Instead, Trump and Kim will agree in principle to the closure and working-level staff will finalize the details in future talks.\nThe Yongbyon nuclear facility is \u201cthe heart of [North Korea\u2019s] nuclear program,\u201d a top expert told the Washington Post last week. It\u2019s the only place (that we know of) where the country can make plutonium for nuclear bombs. If it shuts down, Pyongyang\u2019s ability to make plutonium-fueled nuclear weapons will be severely curtailed.\nThat wouldn\u2019t mean the end of its nuclear program \u2014 not by a long shot \u2014 but it would be a concrete gesture that would help signal that Kim may actually be serious about dismantling the program eventually.\nThat said, it\u2019s one thing for Kim to say he\u2019ll close the facility, and another thing entirely for him to actually do so.\nRebecca Hersman, a nuclear expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told me that for this to be a real concession, Kim would have to let international inspectors into the facility to verify that nuclear material production had really ended. Without those inspections, there\u2019s no way to know if Kim has followed through on his promise.\nThat\u2019s a move the leader may be reluctant to take. And even if he did so, he could always just restart the shuttered facility once the inspectors left \u2014 as his father, Kim Jong Il, did twice before, after deals with the US collapsed.\nThat, in part, is why experts want any deal on closing Yongbyon to be extremely detailed. \u201cAn agreement on the dismantlement of such a site has to be worded deliberately and concisely so technical experts can watch and verify each step in the process,\u201d said Grace Liu of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\nBut if Trump moves to lift sanctions before Kim actually ends all production at Yongbyon, he will have offered a major concession without getting anything substantive in return.\nThe rest of the deal, however, looks pretty good.\nBy signing a peace declaration, both sides will reduce tensions with one another by saying they are no longer warring enemies. By establishing liaison offices, Washington and Pyongyang will take an important step toward normalizing their relations. And by returning more troop remains to the US \u2014 something people close to the negotiations tell me is personally very important to Trump \u2014 North Korea will show it\u2019s serious about staying in America\u2019s good graces.\nSo there\u2019s a lot to like in this potential deal. But it doesn\u2019t really move the needle much on the fundamental goal of denuclearizing North Korea, and mostly just rewards Kim with much-needed sanctions relief for doing little more than continuing to show up for talks and making some vague promises. It that sense, the deal isn\u2019t great for Trump but is a pretty big win for the North Korean leader.\nBut if this serves as a building block to more deals down the line \u2014 leading North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program in the long run \u2014 then it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll all look back on Hanoi fondly in a few years\u2019 time.",

It&rsquo;s the view of a top national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</p>\n<p>Trump and Kim are in Hanoi to discuss how to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program. Negotiators are currently working with an outline of a deal first described to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit\">Vox</a> by three knowledgeable sources on Tuesday, where the US would lift some sanctions on North Korea in exchange for a commitment from Kim to stop nuclear-fuel production at a key nuclear facility.</p>\n<p>Both leaders would also sign a peace declaration to end hostilities toward each other and open liaison offices in both countries, and North Korea would return the remains of a yet-unspecified number of missing US troops who fought and died in the Korean War.</p>\n<p>But when asked publicly about the Vox-reported outline of the pact by the event&rsquo;s moderator, <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/impact-player-moon-chung\">Moon Chung-in</a>, a special adviser for foreign affairs and national security to South Korea&rsquo;s president, was not impressed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal for North Korea and a bad deal for the United States,&rdquo; he said during a Tuesday speaking engagement at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington. He went on to say what he&rsquo;d prefer to see out of Hanoi is a roadmap for negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang going forward and Yongbyon &mdash; the key North Korean nuclear facility &mdash; completely shutdown.</p>\n<p>When I followed up with him after the session, Moon reiterated his point about the tentative outline. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a very good deal,&rdquo; he told me. For all the incentives the US might give North Korea, &ldquo;the US can get much more than that,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>I emailed Moon Tuesday night and asked him to clarify once more.

                "text": "Lee Jin-man/AP\nA proposed outline of a deal that President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may sign during their Vietnam summit this week would be \u201ca bad deal for the United States.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not the view of a cynical expert, or a Democrat. It\u2019s the view of a top national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in.\nTrump and Kim are in Hanoi to discuss how to strike a deal to dismantle North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Negotiators are currently working with an outline of a deal first described to Vox by three knowledgeable sources on Tuesday, where the US would lift some sanctions on North Korea in exchange for a commitment from Kim to stop nuclear-fuel production at a key nuclear facility.\nBoth leaders would also sign a peace declaration to end hostilities toward each other and open liaison offices in both countries, and North Korea would return the remains of a yet-unspecified number of missing US troops who fought and died in the Korean War.\nBut when asked publicly about the Vox-reported outline of the pact by the event\u2019s moderator, Moon Chung-in, a special adviser for foreign affairs and national security to South Korea\u2019s president, was not impressed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good deal for North Korea and a bad deal for the United States,\u201d he said during a Tuesday speaking engagement at the Korea Economic Institute in Washington. He went on to say what he\u2019d prefer to see out of Hanoi is a roadmap for negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang going forward and Yongbyon \u2014 the key North Korean nuclear facility \u2014 completely shutdown.\nWhen I followed up with him after the session, Moon reiterated his point about the tentative outline. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good deal,\u201d he told me. For all the incentives the US might give North Korea, \u201cthe US can get much more than that,\u201d he said.\nI emailed Moon Tuesday night and asked him to clarify once more. Here\u2019s part of what he wrote back on Wednesday morning.\n\u201cOur government cannot accept the idea of exchanging a simple freeze of nuclear activities for such hefty incentives as peace declaration, liaison office, and relaxation of sanction,\u201d he said. \u201cI was only criticizing the hypothetical outline, especially idea of freeze,\u201d he added, noting that if the moderator had said the deal included closing Yongbyon down, which as of now is not in the tentative deal outline, \u201cmy answer should have been different.\u201d\nWhy Moon Chung-in\u2019s statement matters\nThere\u2019s still a long way to go before Trump and Kim put pen to paper, and of course the deal could change dramatically between now and then. But Moon\u2019s statements are still shocking \u2014 and here\u2019s why.\nMoon Chung-in\u2019s boss, Moon Jae-in (no relation), has been a fervent champion of the US and North Korea\u2019s attempts to end the years-long nuclear standoff, and he\u2019s consistently asked both parties to concede more to one another.\nFor one of his top advisers to trash the tentative deal is more than surprising, because it shows that the South Koreans could break ranks with the US if the final deal isn\u2019t received well in Seoul. It\u2019s unclear as of now if the South Korean president agrees or disagrees with his aide, though.\nMoon Chung-in did hedge toward the end of his public remarks. In response to another question about what might constitute a bad deal for South Korea, he said \u201cthere is no such thing as a bad deal,\u201d indicating that as long as US forces don\u2019t leave South Korea and negotiators don\u2019t leave the room screaming, any diplomatic accord would prove a sign of progress between the US and North Korea.\nStill, a top adviser of a critical ally in the US-North Korea talks just trashed the general outline of what Trump and Kim may sign in two days. That\u2019s worth keeping in the back of your mind as they work toward a final agreement.\nUPDATE: This piece has been updated to include Moon Chung-in\u2019s emailed response to me. It has also been corrected to reflect that the moderator asked Moon about a freeze in nuclear-fuel production at Yongbyon, not the dismantlement of the facility.",

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) in October 2018.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), a prominent supporter of President Trump, appeared to threaten former Trump attorney Michael Cohen on Twitter late Tuesday afternoon &mdash; one day before <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/26/18241180/michael-cohen-house-testimony-what-time-how-to-watch\">Cohen testifies </a>before the House Oversight Committee about Trump&rsquo;s business deals and hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump during the 2016 campaign.</p>\n<p>Gaetz, who has represented Florida&rsquo;s First Congressional District since 2017, tweeted, &ldquo;Hey Michael Cohen - Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll remain faithful when you&rsquo;re in prison. She&rsquo;s about to learn a lot...&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MichaelCohen212</a> - Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she&rsquo;ll remain faithful when you&rsquo;re in prison. She&rsquo;s about to learn a lot...</p>&mdash; Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1100503846386835456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a> </blockquote>\n<p>Gaetz has a long history of controversial statements and actions, including <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/florida-congressman-invited-infamous-troll-chuck-johnson-to-trumps-state-of-the-union\">inviting internet troll and occasional Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson</a> to the State of the Union and becoming a leading voice in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/24/16919910/releasethememo-explained-trump-russia\">brief movement </a> to release a memo written by Republican Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) that many on the right believed would damage Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign. Gaetz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEo_nHTLt_k&t=\">even appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones&rsquo;s show</a> to discuss the memo.</p>\n<p>In text messages with my colleague Alex Ward, Gaetz reiterated the sentiments from his tweet, promising &ldquo;fireworks&rdquo; at Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing. (Gaetz is not a member of the House Oversight Committee, so he won&rsquo;t be among the members questioning Cohen.)</p>\n<blockquote> <p>My short text convo with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mattgaetz</a> just now:<br><br>Me: Congressman, Any chance you have a few minutes to discuss what you implied with your tweet to Michael Cohen? Perhaps a preview?<br><br>Gaetz: Watch tomorrow.<br><br>Me: Will do -- anything I should be prepared for?<br><br>Gaetz: Fireworks <a href=\"https://t.co/g1bwYcjvrg\">https://t.co/g1bwYcjvrg</a></p>&mdash; Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexWardVox/status/1100507915197267970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a> </blockquote>\n<p>According to Ken White, an attorney at Brown White &amp; Osborn LLP in Los Angeles, a former federal prosecutor and a frequent commenter on the Mueller investigation (he goes by Popehat on Twitter), Gaetz&rsquo;s tweet was &ldquo;colorably witness intimidation&rdquo; &mdash; which is illegal.</p>\n<p>White directed me to <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512\">18 US Code &sect; 1512</a>, &ldquo;Tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant,&rdquo; which includes efforts to &ldquo;influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-991716523-805818355&term_occur=1357&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:73:section:1512\">person</a> in an official proceeding&rdquo; as forms of witness tampering. And on Twitter, White shared <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1727-protection-government-processes-omnibus-clause-18-usc-1505\">18 USC &sect; 1505</a>, which argues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Generally, a defendant may be found guilty under section 1505 if the government establishes that: (1) there was a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States; (2) the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending; and (3) the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the proceeding was pending. </p></blockquote>\n<p>Gaetz, meanwhile, claims he wasn&rsquo;t tampering with a witness but merely &ldquo;witness testing.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote> <p>UPDATE:<br><br>Me: Any response to those who say you&rsquo;re witness tampering? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mattgaetz</a>: I&rsquo;m witness testing. We still are allowed to test the veracity and character of witnesses, I think.<br><br>Me: So you disagree with those who say you&rsquo;re witness tampering?<br><br>Gaetz: Yes. <a href=\"https://t.co/aBRZAF314A\">https://t.co/aBRZAF314A</a></p>&mdash; Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexWardVox/status/1100511048044564485?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2019</a> </blockquote>\n<p>(He<a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/1100515818314579968\"> told the Daily Beast</a> that his tweet was an example of competing in the &ldquo;marketplace of ideas.&rdquo;)</p>\n<p>White told me that while &ldquo;witness testing&rdquo; does exist, it generally involves cross-examining witnesses under oath, &ldquo;not &lsquo;let&rsquo;s see if he still shows up if I threaten him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen is expected to appear before Congress at 10 am on Wednesday.</p>",

                "text": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), a prominent supporter of President Trump, appeared to threaten former Trump attorney Michael Cohen on Twitter late Tuesday afternoon \u2014 one day before Cohen testifies before the House Oversight Committee about Trump\u2019s business deals and hush money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump during the 2016 campaign.\nGaetz, who has represented Florida\u2019s First Congressional District since 2017, tweeted, \u201cHey Michael Cohen - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot...\u201d\nHey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot...\n\u2014 Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) February 26, 2019\nGaetz has a long history of controversial statements and actions, including inviting internet troll and occasional Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson to the State of the Union and becoming a leading voice in the brief movement to release a memo written by Republican Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) that many on the right believed would damage Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign. Gaetz even appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones\u2019s show to discuss the memo.\nIn text messages with my colleague Alex Ward, Gaetz reiterated the sentiments from his tweet, promising \u201cfireworks\u201d at Wednesday\u2019s hearing. (Gaetz is not a member of the House Oversight Committee, so he won\u2019t be among the members questioning Cohen.)\nMy short text convo with @mattgaetz just now:\nMe: Congressman, Any chance you have a few minutes to discuss what you implied with your tweet to Michael Cohen? Perhaps a preview?\nGaetz: Watch tomorrow.\nMe: Will do -- anything I should be prepared for?\nGaetz: Fireworks https://t.co/g1bwYcjvrg\n\u2014 Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) February 26, 2019\nAccording to Ken White, an attorney at Brown White & Osborn LLP in Los Angeles, a former federal prosecutor and a frequent commenter on the Mueller investigation (he goes by Popehat on Twitter), Gaetz\u2019s tweet was \u201ccolorably witness intimidation\u201d \u2014 which is illegal.\nWhite directed me to 18 US Code \u00a7 1512, \u201cTampering with a witness, victim, or an informant,\u201d which includes efforts to \u201cinfluence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding\u201d as forms of witness tampering. And on Twitter, White shared 18 USC \u00a7 1505, which argues:\nGenerally, a defendant may be found guilty under section 1505 if the government establishes that: (1) there was a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States; (2) the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending; and (3) the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the proceeding was pending.\nGaetz, meanwhile, claims he wasn\u2019t tampering with a witness but merely \u201cwitness testing.\u201d\nUPDATE:\nMe: Any response to those who say you\u2019re witness tampering? @mattgaetz: I\u2019m witness testing. We still are allowed to test the veracity and character of witnesses, I think.\nMe: So you disagree with those who say you\u2019re witness tampering?\nGaetz: Yes. https://t.co/aBRZAF314A\n\u2014 Alex Ward (@AlexWardVox) February 26, 2019\n(He told the Daily Beast that his tweet was an example of competing in the \u201cmarketplace of ideas.\u201d)\nWhite told me that while \u201cwitness testing\u201d does exist, it generally involves cross-examining witnesses under oath, \u201cnot \u2018let\u2019s see if he still shows up if I threaten him.\u2019\u201d\nCohen is expected to appear before Congress at 10 am on Wednesday.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) recently became the first major American politician to propose an annual wealth tax.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Right now these are somewhat disjointed proposals that don&rsquo;t add up to a coherent picture of how the tax system ought to look; Ocasio-Cortez&rsquo;s, especially, was dashed off in the course of an interview (though it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/4/18168431/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-70-percent\">got debated</a> as if it were a carefully constructed white paper).</p>\n<p>But over the 2020 primary and in the new majority-Democratic House, we should expect these ideas to start to harden into a broader agenda for dramatically raising rates on top earners.</p>\n<p>At the end of the process, the Democratic Party is likely to wind up with a much more aggressive party consensus on taxes than has prevailed since the 1980s.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t a change that came out of nowhere. It comes out of a growing dissatisfaction with the timidity of Democratic efforts to tax the rich in the Clinton and Obama eras, and a growing intellectual trend in economics that has given a sound theoretical basis to tax plans that soak the rich.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not a trend that&rsquo;s necessarily going to be easy to translate into policy. There are some important questions to sort out: What tax rate should we apply to the richest to maximize revenue? What rate is so high that it begins to discourage work &mdash; and the government gains less revenue? How feasible is a tax on wealth (as opposed to income), and what obstacles stand in the way? These and many other details need to be reckoned with as Democrats begin to think about turning campaigning into real policy.</p>\n<h3>The Democratic proposals to tax the rich</h3>\n<p>Before we get into it, let&rsquo;s recap the basic plans &mdash; or loosely sketched ideas &mdash; for taxing the rich currently on offer from prominent Democrats:</p>\n<ul> <li>Rep. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/4/18168431/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-70-percent\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (D-NY) suggested a top rate of 70 percent on incomes over $10 million, which would actually be somewhat below prevailing rates under Dwight Eisenhower, and around where top rates were from Lyndon Johnson to Jimmy Carter.</li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/24/18196275/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax\">Warren&rsquo;s plan</a> would set up a progressive wealth tax, with a normal rate of 2 percent on wealth over $50 million and a top rate of 3 percent on wealth over $1 billion. That might sound small, but because it&rsquo;s levied on wealth, not income, and every year rather than at death, it could wind up hitting billionaires harder than high income or estate taxes.</li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/31/18205294/bernie-sanders-estate-tax-99-percent\">Sanders&rsquo;s plan</a> would raise the top estate tax rate to 77 percent. That&rsquo;s the same top rate that <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/ninetyestate.pdf\">existed from 1941 to 1976</a>; this is higher than the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-senator-bernie-sanderss-tax-proposals/full\">65 percent top rate</a> he proposed in the 2016 race.</li> <li>Sen. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/17999558/cory-booker-baby-bonds\">Cory Booker</a> (D-NJ) has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tax/2018/10/23/dont-bet-on-it-383765\">proposed a 65 percent estate tax rate</a> (higher than at any point <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/ninetyestate.pdf\">since 1982</a>), a higher capital gains tax rate, and applying capital gains taxes to assets held at death, all to pay for his <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/3766/text#toc-id19C2A6C1830448418A35EBBF7334B505\">baby bonds bill</a>.</li> <li>Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a lefty House Democrat who&rsquo;s been proposing a <a href=\"https://schakowsky.house.gov/press-releases/schakowsky-introduces-fairness-in-taxation-act/\">top income tax rate of 49 percent</a> <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/rep-schakowsky-introduces-legislation-raise-taxes-millionaires-and-billionaires\">since at least 2011</a>, says she&rsquo;s working with Ocasio-Cortez to formulate a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/wave-of-tax-proposals-has-caught-wealthy-liberals-off-guard--but-they-may-not-be-able-to-stop-them/2019/02/06/0d3824e6-2a31-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?utm_term=.de99e4759a76\">new bill that might feature even higher top rates</a>.</li> <li>And if Sanders excitedly releasing his estate tax plan after Warren&rsquo;s wealth tax proposal is any indication, the 2020 race will involve a leftward arms race as candidates attempting to court voters worried about income inequality try to one-up each other&rsquo;s plans to tax the rich.</li> </ul>\n<h3>A recent history of taxing the rich</h3>\n<p>High tax rates targeting the rich used to be the norm in the United States. As recently as 1963, the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates\">top income tax rate</a> was 91 percent, a rate that persisted, plus or minus a point or two, from World War II through Truman and Eisenhower and the early Kennedy years.</p>\n<p>A mere quarter-century later in 1988, the top rate had toppled to 28 percent. How&rsquo;d they get there?</p>\n<p>Both parties played a role. First, under across-the-board tax cuts backed by John F. Kennedy and signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/laws-proposals/major-enacted-tax-legislation-1960-1969#revenue-act-of-1964\">top rate fell to 70 percent</a>.

Bush to conclude that a 28 percent top rate was infeasibly low, prompting him to <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/laws-proposals/major-enacted-tax-legislation-1990-1999#omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act-of-1990\">boost it to 31 percent</a> when he famously violated his &ldquo;no new taxes&rdquo; pledge in 1990. Shortly after taking office in 1993, <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/laws-proposals/major-enacted-tax-legislation-1990-1999#omnibus-budget-reconciliation-act-of-1993\">Bill Clinton added 36 percent and 39.6 percent brackets</a>.</p>\n<p>Fights over the top income tax rate ever since have taken place in a very narrow band between 35 and 39.6 percent. George W. Bush cut it to 35 in 2001; Obama forced House Republicans to agree to restore it to 39.6 percent in late 2012; Donald Trump and his congressional allies brought it back down to 37 percent in 2017.</p>\n<p>The Affordable Care Act <em>did</em> include a small 0.9 percent surtax on wages for wealthy individuals, which put their effective top rate (including the existing 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax) at 43.4 percent by the time Obama left office; Trump&rsquo;s tax cuts took that number down to 40.8 percent.</p>\n<p>The estate tax has seen a <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/exemption-level-1916-2017\">similar trajectory</a>, stagnating at 55 percent between the first Reagan tax cuts and George W. Bush. The 2001 tax cuts then set it on course to be totally abolished &mdash; and it was for one year, 2010, a truly great year for rich people to die in &mdash; only to see it resurrected with lower top rates (35 percent and 40 percent) after the 2010 and 2012 budget battles.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581082014_4461_352121\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zF4DVUa794EtIbllMwHc5YECqvY=/0x0:2000x1312/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XvDpSFXAbZQqP6crhTSNYEGS8kM=/0x0:2000x1312/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sqwDnmIWZuJibH6PdQIk1MT6AOM=/0x0:2000x1312/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdvpUtkvdQH8zMt_-SP1EIk6XZ8=/0x0:2000x1312/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Ah5QkEoATK7a4QRIr2dOYkh1fE=/0x0:2000x1312/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ygcSQ7pFi2eMkZBQXYY1Ilv4Zss=/0x0:2000x1312/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzTN9Eh1ULYUFUW3BLJHAUmXook=/0x0:2000x1312/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GomrMpZBIzU1_F0yfoAaJNVDVbU=/0x0:2000x1312/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLpQiNTo7F2gUjMv9t0wlZ_UKXk=/0x0:2000x1312/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1312):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15969874/GettyImages_908495.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"President George W.

His two principal ideas were the &ldquo;Buffett Rule&rdquo; &mdash; a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for people with $1 million-plus in income, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/stop-coddling-the-super-rich.html\">inspired by Warren Buffett</a> &mdash; and a <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/obamas-cap-tax-deductions-not-what-it-seems\">cap on itemized deductions and exclusions</a>. The Buffett Rule would&rsquo;ve dramatically <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/how-would-buffett-rule-affect-marginal-tax-rates\">increased the tax rate on investment income</a>, but only to the mid-30s range.

Berkeley&rsquo;s Emmanuel Saez and the Paris School of Economics&rsquo; Thomas Piketty have been using tax records to analyze income inequality for decades now, but a handful of publications by them and collaborators in recent years made high marginal rates intellectually respectable.</p>\n<h4>Is 73 percent the magic number?</h4>\n<p>One paper in particular looms large here. In 2012, Saez and Peter Diamond, an MIT professor who had recently won the Nobel in economics, released <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.4.165\">&ldquo;The Case for a Progressive Tax,&rdquo; </a>which estimated that the optimal top tax rate in the US &mdash; the rate that maximizes both revenue and the welfare of Americans &mdash; is about <em>73 percent</em>. That&rsquo;s much higher than the top rate in the US, even taking into account state and local taxes in high-tax places like California and New York.</p>\n<p>Saez and Diamond&rsquo;s calculation relied on the idea of diminishing marginal utility &mdash; rich individuals benefit less from additional money than low- or middle-income people do &mdash; and on their estimation that top earners aren&rsquo;t very responsive to top tax rates.</p>\n<p>The 73 percent figure relies on a <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/saez-slemrod-giertzJEL12.pdf\">&ldquo;mid-range estimate&rdquo;</a> of the elasticity of income in response to taxation for the rich that is quite low (0.25). Elasticity measures how much one factor (in this case, the income earned by the rich) changes in response to another (in this case, the tax rate). In this instance, low elasticity means raising taxes on the rich would cause them to work less and hurt economic growth &mdash; but not by <em>that</em> much, and that effect is easily outweighed by the benefits of higher tax revenue spent to benefit the non-rich through welfare state programs.</p>\n<p>Economists who dispute the Saez-Diamond result tend to argue that <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/-should-the-top-marginal-income-tax-rate-be-73-percent_085518416524.pdf\">0.25 is too low of an elasticity estimate</a>, and that a top rate in the realm of 73 percent would significantly reduce the rich&rsquo;s work effort. A recent paper, for instance, argued that the <a href=\"http://faculty.georgetown.edu/mh5/research/top-earners.pdf\">revenue-maximizing rate is more like 49 percent</a>, when you take into account the prospect that high tax rates could discourage young people from developing economically useful skills.</p>\n<h4>Capital: to tax or not to tax </h4>\n<p>Saez and Diamond also argued that capital income &mdash; income from things like capital gains, corporate profits, dividends, etc. &mdash; should be taxed, which broke <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course/AtkinsonStiglitz_JPubE(1976).pdf\">with</a> <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0047272785900209\">previous</a> <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911310?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">models</a> of optimal tax theory. (Our current capital gains top rate is 23.8 percent.) Those models had suggested the proper tax rate on capital income was zero, on the grounds that it discouraged savings: If you spend money on an investment, your profits are taxed, but if you spend money on food or a house or what have you, you don&rsquo;t get hit with a capital tax &mdash; so a capital tax&rsquo;s presence pushes you to spend more and save less.</p>\n<p>But Saez and Diamond dispute whether these model findings are relevant to lived reality. If you&rsquo;re a lawyer with your own practice, are your billable hours capital income (profits accruing to your law firm) or wage income (earnings accruing to you)? There&rsquo;s ambiguity there, and taxing capital income less than labor income can thus lead to gaming. The rich have a strong incentive to reclassify labor income as capital income &mdash; the way that hedge fund and private equity managers do already using the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-carried-interest-and-should-it-be-taxed-capital-gain\">carried interest loophole</a> &mdash; which suggests we should tax capital income to prevent this kind of avoidance.</p>\n<p>This argument is important for estate taxes as well, as they are also a kind of capital tax. A <a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/piketty-saezECMA13.pdf\">2013 paper by Piketty and Saez</a> made this argument explicitly, arguing that the optimal inheritance tax rate was something like 50 to 60 percent, and possibly even higher for the very rich.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581082014_2365_352123\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw -

Most optimal tax papers tend to assume a kind of crude utilitarianism: Taxes should be used to maximize the public welfare, roughly estimated, so you should only take money from the rich so long as doing so boosts overall welfare.</p>\n<p>But maybe we don&rsquo;t care as much about overall welfare but instead the welfare of the worst-off. Piketty and Saez show that the optimal inheritance tax is much higher if you use a &ldquo;Rawlsian&rdquo; social welfare function, where the goal is for taxes to maximize the interests of the worst-off, not of everyone.</p>\n<p>Piketty also, of course, promoted a specific kind of capital tax in his best-seller <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/4/8/5592198/the-short-guide-to-capital-in-the-21st-century\"><em>Capital in the 21st Century</em></a>: a tax on accumulated wealth, with <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=T8zuAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA529#v=onepage&q&f=false\">top rates of 2 percent or more</a>. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that Saez and his Berkeley colleague Gabriel Zucman, who both work closely with Piketty, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/01/24/elizabeth-warren-propose-new-wealth-tax-very-rich-americans-economist-says/?utm_term=.3a68285833e1\">advised Warren on her proposal</a> for a wealth tax topping out at 3 percent. In the context of Piketty&rsquo;s book, the wealth tax is meant to prevent the permanent intergenerational accumulation of wealth, which he argues will be inevitable due to the rate of interest on capital exceeding the rate of economic growth (his <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/4/1/8320937/this-26-year-old-grad-student-didnt-really-debunk-piketty-but-what-he\">famous r &gt; g claim</a>).</p>\n<h4>Wage bargaining and the &ldquo;third elasticity&rdquo;</h4>\n<p>The last key component of this literature is a <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.6.1.230\">paper by Piketty, Saez, and Harvard professor Stefanie Stantcheva</a>, which introduced the idea of a &ldquo;third elasticity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The first elasticity in their model is the one described above, representing the effect of top tax rates on the work effort of top earners. Maybe Apple CEO Tim Cook would be less likely to pursue new projects in search of a big bonus if he thought that 70 to 80 percent of that bonus would be confiscated. They argue this elasticity is fairly small, in the 0.2 to 0.25 range, in keeping with Saez&rsquo;s article with Diamond.</p>\n<p>The second elasticity is the elasticity of avoidance: how much tax dodging increases as tax rates go up. Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva argue that this elasticity is even smaller.</p>\n<p>The third elasticity is where the real action is. High tax rates, the authors note, do not merely reduce work effort and increase tax avoidance; they also decrease wage bargaining. When people like Cook&rsquo;s tax rate is low, they have a strong incentive (as do other top Apple executives) to fight for increased compensation for themselves where possible. But when top tax rates are high, they&rsquo;re less likely to fight as hard, and more likely to use that money to pay workers in lower tax brackets, invest, etc.</p>\n<p>Bargaining effects like these, Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva argue, are bigger than the effects on actual work effort. By reducing bargaining like this, high income tax rates actually perform a social good. That implies the top tax rate could be very high indeed &mdash; their preferred parameters result in a top rate of 83 percent.</p>\n<p>All of this adds up to a comprehensive intellectual case for the proposals that Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, and Warren are floating: much higher income and estate tax rates, and perhaps an annual wealth tax as well.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581082014_4562_352124\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P98pMg0_OkSaEeIQx0WMGqhR8kI=/0x0:5478x3652/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fc5JA-mBwl76e4B3s0fpri82vbM=/0x0:5478x3652/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9pR8Bc4dx0tpoMmLkpof0P2Tns=/0x0:5478x3652/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b3I7KnlRWV0QhiyGK6Au1RNnPBE=/0x0:5478x3652/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2x7U9qW9pGjsuOMpnTlMZ4lbBE4=/0x0:5478x3652/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dxgVoyxa7ZXsrVpNaeBxzVi248=/0x0:5478x3652/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRew2m70jgEk5MalcXymhiXyFjc=/0x0:5478x3652/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2tUmEVQeZqcC38VpdgLwAD_ox8=/0x0:5478x3652/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGt3qCMYlBH6DWrmqideEKI89t4=/0x0:5478x3652/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:5478x3652):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970315/GettyImages_1091486720.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"Rep.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) moved the Overton window considerably on top income tax rates.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The ideas of the French school of inequality economics are controversial within the profession. Plenty of tax economists on the center and right tend to believe top rates are worse for growth than Saez et al. conclude, and that taxes on investment are especially costly. In particular, many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wwwojtekk/status/1092416278508326913\">doubt that there&rsquo;s a solid empirical basis</a> for the idea of a third elasticity.</p>\n<p>But while top rate skepticism was once the dominant view within economics, the French school has shown that it&rsquo;s possible to defend much, much higher rates, including on capital income, using fairly standard methods and empirical evidence.</p>\n<h3>Why taxing the rich can be hard in practice</h3>\n<p>So let&rsquo;s say you buy the French school evidence. Time to all get on board higher income, estate, and wealth taxes, right? Maybe &mdash; but there are some practical complications worth sorting out first.</p>\n<p>The US obviously knows how to levy very high taxes on rich people&rsquo;s wage income. But capital income is trickier. After the income tax was first adopted in the 1910s, capital gains were initially treated as regular income and taxed at the same rate. But that quickly changed, and <a href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/96-769.pdf\">from 1921 onward</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-capital-gains-and-taxes\">top rate on capital gains never exceeded 40 percent</a>, and was often quite a bit lower than that.</p>\n<p>There are two major reasons for that. The first is fear of the negative effects on savings of high capital gains rates. But arguably more important was fear of &ldquo;lock-in.&rdquo; Because capital gains taxes are only levied when an asset is sold, very high rates on capital gains can lead investors to simply not sell stocks at all for long periods. That, among other issues, reduces federal revenue.</p>\n<p>NYU tax law professor David Kamin has a great paper, simply titled <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2550936\">&rdquo;How to Tax the Rich,&rdquo;</a> explaining some of the difficulties here. Right now the top capital gains rate is 23.8 percent. But because of lock-in, the revenue-maximizing rate for capital gains is more like only 28 to 32 percent, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Treasury Department (as summarized by Kamin) &mdash; not too much higher than the current top rate. Some economists argue that JCT and Treasury are too pessimistic, but as JCT will be scoring any bill raising capital gains rates, its verdict is the one that matters.</p>\n<p>Kamin estimates that you could get, at most, $10 billion to $15 billion more a year from raising capital gains rates to their revenue-maximizing rates, and another $10 billion from treating dividends like regular income. That&rsquo;s not chump change, but in terms of the federal budget, it&rsquo;s not a whole lot either.</p>\n<p>To get around the problem of &ldquo;lock-in,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d want to move to something called a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1520732\">&ldquo;mark-to-market&rdquo;</a> <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000817-a-proposal-to-reform-the-taxation-of-corporate-income.pdf\">capital</a> <a href=\"https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=2686&context=llr\">tax</a>. Instead of only taxing gains on assets when they&rsquo;re sold, you&rsquo;d tax gains based on the assets&rsquo; estimated value every year, even if the stocks in question are just sitting in a Vanguard account. That approach would allow for much higher rates on capital gains &mdash; but it would be a huge reform, and perhaps difficult to achieve.</p>\n<p>Wealth taxes face an even bigger hurdle in the form of Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 of the Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Helpfully, the Constitution does not define what a &ldquo;direct tax&rdquo; is. But as <a href=\"https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/how-to-tax-wealth-constitutionally-863ce992ac7e\">UChicago&rsquo;s Daniel Hemel explains</a>, it&rsquo;s often assumed to include land taxes, and before the 16th Amendment it was assumed to include income taxes as well. (The 16th Amendment enabled federal income taxes but did not expressly allow wealth or property taxes.)</p>\n<p>That means wealth taxes might, under the Constitution, have to be &ldquo;apportioned&rdquo; among the states according to their populations. (&ldquo;That means that if California amounts to 12 percent of the U.S. population, Californians must pay 12 percent of any direct tax &mdash; no more, no less,&rdquo; Hemel writes.)</p>\n<p>Many legal scholars, notably including <a href=\"https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol93/iss1/8/\">Dawn Johnsen of Indiana University and Duke&rsquo;s Walter Dellinger</a> in a paper last year, believe that wealth taxes do not run afoul of the Constitution. When unveiling her wealth tax plan, Warren released letters signed by a number of constitutional and tax law experts, including Johnsen and Dellinger, Yale&rsquo;s Anne Alstott and Bruce Ackerman, Stanford&rsquo;s Pam Karlan, UChicago&rsquo;s Aziz Huq, and UT Austin&rsquo;s Calvin Johnson, arguing for the tax&rsquo;s constitutionality.</p>\n<p>But some <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-30/elizabeth-warren-s-wealth-tax-is-probably-constitutional\">credible tax scholars on the left</a> like <a href=\"https://medium.com/whatever-source-derived/how-to-tax-wealth-constitutionally-863ce992ac7e\">Hemel</a> think a wealth tax <em>does</em> raise real constitutional issues. It&rsquo;s also worth being much more cynical on this issue: Do you really think, in your heart of hearts, that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court will miss an opportunity to strike down a wealth tax passed by a Democratic president?</p>\n<p>And then there are more boring logistical questions about wealth taxes: How do we locate rich people&rsquo;s wealth? Is it possible to value real estate accurately every year? Is the US really going to get aggressive about tax havens? These administrative issues, a recent OECD report found, have <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-OECD-summary.pdf\">led many European countries to abandon wealth taxes</a> in recent years.</p>\n<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s estate taxation. The estate tax currently uses a principle called &ldquo;step-up basis,&rdquo; which cuts down on the revenue it can bring in.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. Imagine you&rsquo;re living in New York in the 1980s and buy an original Basquiat painting for $200. By the time you die and leave that painting to your daughter, it&rsquo;s worth $40 million. If your daughter then sells it, she&rsquo;ll pay capital gains tax &mdash; but only on the difference between the sale price and $40 million. The tax code defines heirs&rsquo; gain relative to the value of an asset when they inherit it, rather than its value when their bequeathers originally bought it. Tax Policy Center head Len Burman has called this <a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2015/01/18/president-obama-targets-angel-death-capital-gains-tax-loophole/\">&rdquo;arguably the biggest loophole in the tax code for high-wealth households.&rdquo;</a></p>\n<p>The Booker estate tax bill would replace this with realization upon bequest or gift. That would mean that your hypothetical daughter would pay tax on your nearly $40 million gain as soon as you died. Kamin estimates that this would raise at least $40 billion a year, in part because people currently hoarding assets until death, when the gains become tax-free, would now have a reason to sell them off early. That&rsquo;s good for overall economic efficiency as well.</p>\n<p>But arguably the whole estate tax could use a restructuring. A number of tax analysts, notably NYU Law&rsquo;s Lily Batchelder, have proposed <a href=\"http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/Taxing_Privilege_More_Effectively-_Replacing_the_Estate_Tax_with_an_Inheritance_Tax.pdf\">moving to an inheritance tax</a>, where the living beneficiaries of an estate, rather than the deceased person&rsquo;s estate itself, would include inheritance money in their taxable income and perhaps pay an additional surtax on it.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say: Democrats have gotten to the first stage in the tax-the-rich process. They&rsquo;re sketching out broad ideas that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/economy/wealth-tax-elizabeth-warren.html\">poll well</a> and offer red meat to primary and caucus voters for 2020. And they haven&rsquo;t yet committed to approaches to handle these implementation details, like tracking wealth, taxing capital income as it&rsquo;s earned, and taxing inheritances rather than estates.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581082014_6845_352125\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DD_jwRUCEf0tCMsr0Jng_02Kjwk=/0x0:6720x4480/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PaelbfgJhyf-x6mwMCr_IIG4mK4=/0x0:6720x4480/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5h32fzIk46RPTl0vS8FEb02z3-8=/0x0:6720x4480/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HrdrSz2nbrGnhebB3Bcbb_ZAgLw=/0x0:6720x4480/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r4mgmv8zq1gq1ybGx2yJ1exK-cw=/0x0:6720x4480/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FpFIG81MHpdl1ronljUgYuf5vho=/0x0:6720x4480/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vv2Dq0kv4IwziVAof8yY1SrzGAM=/0x0:6720x4480/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQXx53x8q-kaQhLKELSP3pUEU54=/0x0:6720x4480/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PaMCQ6jZrR91abhbePWj-L6Y35U=/0x0:6720x4480/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15970381/GettyImages_893016956.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"Sen.

So Democrats in Congress might benefit from sorting out the details sooner rather than later, lest they find themselves similarly flat-footed once they&rsquo;re in power.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect-newsletter\"><em><strong>Sign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.</strong></em></a><em>Twice a week, you&rsquo;ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and &mdash; to put it simply &mdash; getting better at doing good.</em></p>",

                "text": "The 1990s Democratic Party made friends with the rich. The 2008 Democratic Party was eager to bail them out. The 2019 Democratic Party seems ready to declare war.\nIn just the past few months, at least three major Democratic Party figures, two of whom are presidential contenders, have proposed large tax increases targeted at the richest Americans:\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) floated a big increase in top marginal income tax rates in an interview on 60 Minutes. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) proposed an annual wealth tax. Sen. Bernie Sanders. (I-VT) proposed a drastic hike in the estate tax.\nThe Democratic urge to tax the rich isn\u2019t a wholly new development. In the 2016 general election, Hillary Clinton embraced Sanders\u2019s proposal for a 65 percent top estate tax rate, and both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were able to raise the top income tax rate by a few points.\nBut Sanders, Warren, and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposals are significantly more ambitious; Warren, for instance, is proposing a kind of tax the federal government has never imposed before, breaking totally new ground.\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\nRight now these are somewhat disjointed proposals that don\u2019t add up to a coherent picture of how the tax system ought to look; Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, especially, was dashed off in the course of an interview (though it got debated as if it were a carefully constructed white paper).\nBut over the 2020 primary and in the new majority-Democratic House, we should expect these ideas to start to harden into a broader agenda for dramatically raising rates on top earners.\nAt the end of the process, the Democratic Party is likely to wind up with a much more aggressive party consensus on taxes than has prevailed since the 1980s.\nThis isn\u2019t a change that came out of nowhere. It comes out of a growing dissatisfaction with the timidity of Democratic efforts to tax the rich in the Clinton and Obama eras, and a growing intellectual trend in economics that has given a sound theoretical basis to tax plans that soak the rich.\nBut it\u2019s not a trend that\u2019s necessarily going to be easy to translate into policy. There are some important questions to sort out: What tax rate should we apply to the richest to maximize revenue? What rate is so high that it begins to discourage work \u2014 and the government gains less revenue? How feasible is a tax on wealth (as opposed to income), and what obstacles stand in the way? These and many other details need to be reckoned with as Democrats begin to think about turning campaigning into real policy.\nThe Democratic proposals to tax the rich\nBefore we get into it, let\u2019s recap the basic plans \u2014 or loosely sketched ideas \u2014 for taxing the rich currently on offer from prominent Democrats:\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) suggested a top rate of 70 percent on incomes over $10 million, which would actually be somewhat below prevailing rates under Dwight Eisenhower, and around where top rates were from Lyndon Johnson to Jimmy Carter.\nWarren\u2019s plan would set up a progressive wealth tax, with a normal rate of 2 percent on wealth over $50 million and a top rate of 3 percent on wealth over $1 billion. That might sound small, but because it\u2019s levied on wealth, not income, and every year rather than at death, it could wind up hitting billionaires harder than high income or estate taxes.\nSanders\u2019s plan would raise the top estate tax rate to 77 percent. That\u2019s the same top rate that existed from 1941 to 1976; this is higher than the 65 percent top rate he proposed in the 2016 race.\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) has proposed a 65 percent estate tax rate (higher than at any point since 1982), a higher capital gains tax rate, and applying capital gains taxes to assets held at death, all to pay for his baby bonds bill.\nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), a lefty House Democrat who\u2019s been proposing a top income tax rate of 49 percent since at least 2011, says she\u2019s working with Ocasio-Cortez to formulate a new bill that might feature even higher top rates.\nAnd if Sanders excitedly releasing his estate tax plan after Warren\u2019s wealth tax proposal is any indication, the 2020 race will involve a leftward arms race as candidates attempting to court voters worried about income inequality try to one-up each other\u2019s plans to tax the rich.\nA recent history of taxing the rich\nHigh tax rates targeting the rich used to be the norm in the United States. As recently as 1963, the top income tax rate was 91 percent, a rate that persisted, plus or minus a point or two, from World War II through Truman and Eisenhower and the early Kennedy years.\nA mere quarter-century later in 1988, the top rate had toppled to 28 percent. How\u2019d they get there?\nBoth parties played a role. First, under across-the-board tax cuts backed by John F. Kennedy and signed by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, the top rate fell to 70 percent. Then Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1981 tax cuts slashed top rates for both the income and estate tax \u2014 the former down to 50 percent, the latter to 55 percent by 1984. Finally, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, along with Reagan, put together the 1986 tax reforms, which cut back on a number of major income tax deductions but also took the top rate down to 28 percent.\nDirck Halstead/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\nA desire to slash deficits led George H.W. Bush to conclude that a 28 percent top rate was infeasibly low, prompting him to boost it to 31 percent when he famously violated his \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge in 1990. Shortly after taking office in 1993, Bill Clinton added 36 percent and 39.6 percent brackets.\nFights over the top income tax rate ever since have taken place in a very narrow band between 35 and 39.6 percent. George W. Bush cut it to 35 in 2001; Obama forced House Republicans to agree to restore it to 39.6 percent in late 2012; Donald Trump and his congressional allies brought it back down to 37 percent in 2017.\nThe Affordable Care Act did include a small 0.9 percent surtax on wages for wealthy individuals, which put their effective top rate (including the existing 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax) at 43.4 percent by the time Obama left office; Trump\u2019s tax cuts took that number down to 40.8 percent.\nThe estate tax has seen a similar trajectory, stagnating at 55 percent between the first Reagan tax cuts and George W. Bush. The 2001 tax cuts then set it on course to be totally abolished \u2014 and it was for one year, 2010, a truly great year for rich people to die in \u2014 only to see it resurrected with lower top rates (35 percent and 40 percent) after the 2010 and 2012 budget battles.\nErik S. Lesser/Newsmakers via Getty Images\nObama proposed other measures to increase taxation on top earners that Congress never gave a hearing, but they were modest compared to the ideas that Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez, and Warren are floating now. His two principal ideas were the \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d \u2014 a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for people with $1 million-plus in income, inspired by Warren Buffett \u2014 and a cap on itemized deductions and exclusions. The Buffett Rule would\u2019ve dramatically increased the tax rate on investment income, but only to the mid-30s range. Neither plan would\u2019ve raised the top rate on wage income to anything like its historic highs.\nObama certainly wanted to increase taxes on the rich more than he did. But even his most ambitious proposals were not really scaled to substantially cut inequality or raise a huge amount of revenue. The new generation of Democratic proposals are.\nThe intellectual basis for taxing the rich\nSo what accounts for the new aggressive support for taxing the rich among leading Democrats? There\u2019s the Great Recession, in which bankers were bailed out as high unemployment persisted for years; and the Occupy movement, which made economic inequality a core national issue in 2011 and onward.\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\nBut an important intellectual precondition was the work of a handful of French economists focusing on distributional issues. Berkeley\u2019s Emmanuel Saez and the Paris School of Economics\u2019 Thomas Piketty have been using tax records to analyze income inequality for decades now, but a handful of publications by them and collaborators in recent years made high marginal rates intellectually respectable.\nIs 73 percent the magic number?\nOne paper in particular looms large here. In 2012, Saez and Peter Diamond, an MIT professor who had recently won the Nobel in economics, released \u201cThe Case for a Progressive Tax,\u201d which estimated that the optimal top tax rate in the US \u2014 the rate that maximizes both revenue and the welfare of Americans \u2014 is about 73 percent. That\u2019s much higher than the top rate in the US, even taking into account state and local taxes in high-tax places like California and New York.\nSaez and Diamond\u2019s calculation relied on the idea of diminishing marginal utility \u2014 rich individuals benefit less from additional money than low- or middle-income people do \u2014 and on their estimation that top earners aren\u2019t very responsive to top tax rates.\nThe 73 percent figure relies on a \u201cmid-range estimate\u201d of the elasticity of income in response to taxation for the rich that is quite low (0.25). Elasticity measures how much one factor (in this case, the income earned by the rich) changes in response to another (in this case, the tax rate). In this instance, low elasticity means raising taxes on the rich would cause them to work less and hurt economic growth \u2014 but not by that much, and that effect is easily outweighed by the benefits of higher tax revenue spent to benefit the non-rich through welfare state programs.\nEconomists who dispute the Saez-Diamond result tend to argue that 0.25 is too low of an elasticity estimate, and that a top rate in the realm of 73 percent would significantly reduce the rich\u2019s work effort. A recent paper, for instance, argued that the revenue-maximizing rate is more like 49 percent, when you take into account the prospect that high tax rates could discourage young people from developing economically useful skills.\nCapital: to tax or not to tax\nSaez and Diamond also argued that capital income \u2014 income from things like capital gains, corporate profits, dividends, etc. \u2014 should be taxed, which broke with previous models of optimal tax theory. (Our current capital gains top rate is 23.8 percent.) Those models had suggested the proper tax rate on capital income was zero, on the grounds that it discouraged savings: If you spend money on an investment, your profits are taxed, but if you spend money on food or a house or what have you, you don\u2019t get hit with a capital tax \u2014 so a capital tax\u2019s presence pushes you to spend more and save less.\nBut Saez and Diamond dispute whether these model findings are relevant to lived reality. If you\u2019re a lawyer with your own practice, are your billable hours capital income (profits accruing to your law firm) or wage income (earnings accruing to you)? There\u2019s ambiguity there, and taxing capital income less than labor income can thus lead to gaming. The rich have a strong incentive to reclassify labor income as capital income \u2014 the way that hedge fund and private equity managers do already using the carried interest loophole \u2014 which suggests we should tax capital income to prevent this kind of avoidance.\nThis argument is important for estate taxes as well, as they are also a kind of capital tax. A 2013 paper by Piketty and Saez made this argument explicitly, arguing that the optimal inheritance tax rate was something like 50 to 60 percent, and possibly even higher for the very rich.\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images\nPiketty and Saez\u2019s inheritance paper also notes that what tax rate is \u201coptimal\u201d depends a lot on your moral philosophy. Most optimal tax papers tend to assume a kind of crude utilitarianism: Taxes should be used to maximize the public welfare, roughly estimated, so you should only take money from the rich so long as doing so boosts overall welfare.\nBut maybe we don\u2019t care as much about overall welfare but instead the welfare of the worst-off. Piketty and Saez show that the optimal inheritance tax is much higher if you use a \u201cRawlsian\u201d social welfare function, where the goal is for taxes to maximize the interests of the worst-off, not of everyone.\nPiketty also, of course, promoted a specific kind of capital tax in his best-seller Capital in the 21st Century: a tax on accumulated wealth, with top rates of 2 percent or more. It\u2019s no coincidence that Saez and his Berkeley colleague Gabriel Zucman, who both work closely with Piketty, advised Warren on her proposal for a wealth tax topping out at 3 percent. In the context of Piketty\u2019s book, the wealth tax is meant to prevent the permanent intergenerational accumulation of wealth, which he argues will be inevitable due to the rate of interest on capital exceeding the rate of economic growth (his famous r > g claim).\nWage bargaining and the \u201cthird elasticity\u201d\nThe last key component of this literature is a paper by Piketty, Saez, and Harvard professor Stefanie Stantcheva, which introduced the idea of a \u201cthird elasticity.\u201d\nThe first elasticity in their model is the one described above, representing the effect of top tax rates on the work effort of top earners. Maybe Apple CEO Tim Cook would be less likely to pursue new projects in search of a big bonus if he thought that 70 to 80 percent of that bonus would be confiscated. They argue this elasticity is fairly small, in the 0.2 to 0.25 range, in keeping with Saez\u2019s article with Diamond.\nThe second elasticity is the elasticity of avoidance: how much tax dodging increases as tax rates go up. Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva argue that this elasticity is even smaller.\nThe third elasticity is where the real action is. High tax rates, the authors note, do not merely reduce work effort and increase tax avoidance; they also decrease wage bargaining. When people like Cook\u2019s tax rate is low, they have a strong incentive (as do other top Apple executives) to fight for increased compensation for themselves where possible. But when top tax rates are high, they\u2019re less likely to fight as hard, and more likely to use that money to pay workers in lower tax brackets, invest, etc.\nBargaining effects like these, Piketty, Saez, and Stantcheva argue, are bigger than the effects on actual work effort. By reducing bargaining like this, high income tax rates actually perform a social good. That implies the top tax rate could be very high indeed \u2014 their preferred parameters result in a top rate of 83 percent.\nAll of this adds up to a comprehensive intellectual case for the proposals that Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders, and Warren are floating: much higher income and estate tax rates, and perhaps an annual wealth tax as well.\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call\nThe ideas of the French school of inequality economics are controversial within the profession. Plenty of tax economists on the center and right tend to believe top rates are worse for growth than Saez et al. conclude, and that taxes on investment are especially costly. In particular, many doubt that there\u2019s a solid empirical basis for the idea of a third elasticity.\nBut while top rate skepticism was once the dominant view within economics, the French school has shown that it\u2019s possible to defend much, much higher rates, including on capital income, using fairly standard methods and empirical evidence.\nWhy taxing the rich can be hard in practice\nSo let\u2019s say you buy the French school evidence. Time to all get on board higher income, estate, and wealth taxes, right? Maybe \u2014 but there are some practical complications worth sorting out first.\nThe US obviously knows how to levy very high taxes on rich people\u2019s wage income. But capital income is trickier. After the income tax was first adopted in the 1910s, capital gains were initially treated as regular income and taxed at the same rate. But that quickly changed, and from 1921 onward, the top rate on capital gains never exceeded 40 percent, and was often quite a bit lower than that.\nThere are two major reasons for that. The first is fear of the negative effects on savings of high capital gains rates. But arguably more important was fear of \u201clock-in.\u201d Because capital gains taxes are only levied when an asset is sold, very high rates on capital gains can lead investors to simply not sell stocks at all for long periods. That, among other issues, reduces federal revenue.\nNYU tax law professor David Kamin has a great paper, simply titled \u201dHow to Tax the Rich,\u201d explaining some of the difficulties here. Right now the top capital gains rate is 23.8 percent. But because of lock-in, the revenue-maximizing rate for capital gains is more like only 28 to 32 percent, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Treasury Department (as summarized by Kamin) \u2014 not too much higher than the current top rate. Some economists argue that JCT and Treasury are too pessimistic, but as JCT will be scoring any bill raising capital gains rates, its verdict is the one that matters.\nKamin estimates that you could get, at most, $10 billion to $15 billion more a year from raising capital gains rates to their revenue-maximizing rates, and another $10 billion from treating dividends like regular income. That\u2019s not chump change, but in terms of the federal budget, it\u2019s not a whole lot either.\nTo get around the problem of \u201clock-in,\u201d you\u2019d want to move to something called a \u201cmark-to-market\u201d capital tax. Instead of only taxing gains on assets when they\u2019re sold, you\u2019d tax gains based on the assets\u2019 estimated value every year, even if the stocks in question are just sitting in a Vanguard account. That approach would allow for much higher rates on capital gains \u2014 but it would be a huge reform, and perhaps difficult to achieve.\nWealth taxes face an even bigger hurdle in the form of Article I, Section 9, Clause 4 of the Constitution:\nNo Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.\nHelpfully, the Constitution does not define what a \u201cdirect tax\u201d is. But as UChicago\u2019s Daniel Hemel explains, it\u2019s often assumed to include land taxes, and before the 16th Amendment it was assumed to include income taxes as well. (The 16th Amendment enabled federal income taxes but did not expressly allow wealth or property taxes.)\nThat means wealth taxes might, under the Constitution, have to be \u201capportioned\u201d among the states according to their populations. (\u201cThat means that if California amounts to 12 percent of the U.S. population, Californians must pay 12 percent of any direct tax \u2014 no more, no less,\u201d Hemel writes.)\nMany legal scholars, notably including Dawn Johnsen of Indiana University and Duke\u2019s Walter Dellinger in a paper last year, believe that wealth taxes do not run afoul of the Constitution. When unveiling her wealth tax plan, Warren released letters signed by a number of constitutional and tax law experts, including Johnsen and Dellinger, Yale\u2019s Anne Alstott and Bruce Ackerman, Stanford\u2019s Pam Karlan, UChicago\u2019s Aziz Huq, and UT Austin\u2019s Calvin Johnson, arguing for the tax\u2019s constitutionality.\nBut some credible tax scholars on the left like Hemel think a wealth tax does raise real constitutional issues. It\u2019s also worth being much more cynical on this issue: Do you really think, in your heart of hearts, that the conservative majority of the Supreme Court will miss an opportunity to strike down a wealth tax passed by a Democratic president?\nAnd then there are more boring logistical questions about wealth taxes: How do we locate rich people\u2019s wealth? Is it possible to value real estate accurately every year? Is the US really going to get aggressive about tax havens? These administrative issues, a recent OECD report found, have led many European countries to abandon wealth taxes in recent years.\nFinally, there\u2019s estate taxation. The estate tax currently uses a principle called \u201cstep-up basis,\u201d which cuts down on the revenue it can bring in.\nHere\u2019s how it works. Imagine you\u2019re living in New York in the 1980s and buy an original Basquiat painting for $200. By the time you die and leave that painting to your daughter, it\u2019s worth $40 million. If your daughter then sells it, she\u2019ll pay capital gains tax \u2014 but only on the difference between the sale price and $40 million. The tax code defines heirs\u2019 gain relative to the value of an asset when they inherit it, rather than its value when their bequeathers originally bought it. Tax Policy Center head Len Burman has called this \u201darguably the biggest loophole in the tax code for high-wealth households.\u201d\nThe Booker estate tax bill would replace this with realization upon bequest or gift. That would mean that your hypothetical daughter would pay tax on your nearly $40 million gain as soon as you died. Kamin estimates that this would raise at least $40 billion a year, in part because people currently hoarding assets until death, when the gains become tax-free, would now have a reason to sell them off early. That\u2019s good for overall economic efficiency as well.\nBut arguably the whole estate tax could use a restructuring. A number of tax analysts, notably NYU Law\u2019s Lily Batchelder, have proposed moving to an inheritance tax, where the living beneficiaries of an estate, rather than the deceased person\u2019s estate itself, would include inheritance money in their taxable income and perhaps pay an additional surtax on it.\nAll of which is to say: Democrats have gotten to the first stage in the tax-the-rich process. They\u2019re sketching out broad ideas that poll well and offer red meat to primary and caucus voters for 2020. And they haven\u2019t yet committed to approaches to handle these implementation details, like tracking wealth, taxing capital income as it\u2019s earned, and taxing inheritances rather than estates.\nXinhua/Ting Shen via Getty Images\nThat\u2019s normal. The 2016 primary featured a bevy of Republicans proposing deficit-exploding tax cut plans that primarily benefited the wealthy, and ultimately Trump and congressional Republicans arrived at a tax reform that borrowed from those plans in certain structural ways but also cut top tax rates much, much less. Democratic proposals will face a similar process of loose proposals, analyst scrutiny, and legislative compromise.\nAt the same time, Republicans suffered when it turned out that they couldn\u2019t get their whole party on board with key elements of tax reform that leaders like Paul Ryan considered crucial, like \u201cborder adjustment\u201d for corporate taxes. So Democrats in Congress might benefit from sorting out the details sooner rather than later, lest they find themselves similarly flat-footed once they\u2019re in power.\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.Twice a week, you\u2019ll get a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling our biggest challenges: improving public health, decreasing human and animal suffering, easing catastrophic risks, and \u2014 to put it simply \u2014 getting better at doing good.",

Ricardo Rossell&oacute; has placed a definitive bet on wind, water, and sunshine.

It also gives the territory a head start in bigger, more aggressive climate proposals like the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Green New Deal</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this will be, by leaps and bounds, the quickest transition to renewables that&rsquo;s ever happened anywhere on the planet,&rdquo; said P.J. Wilson, president of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. &ldquo;To go from [2] percent today to 40 percent by five years from now will be the biggest challenge the renewable energy industry [in Puerto Rico] has ever faced, on top of a very challenging political situation and a challenging financial situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, Puerto Rico will be pursuing an aggressive renewable energy target from a fragile position. It currently gets the bulk of its electricity from fossil fuels and its power grid has suffered from years of poor maintenance and neglect. As an island, it&rsquo;s isolated from a larger power grid, so there are few backup options if energy infrastructure fails.</p>\n<p>This was all too apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which left the island shrouded in the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/2/8/16986408/puerto-rico-blackout-power-hurricane\">largest blackout in US history</a>. Emerging from the chaos of the storm, Puerto Rico is now undergoing one of the sharpest and most abrupt changes to its energy system of any part of the United States. There is an opportunity here to build a cleaner and more resilient grid, but the factors that contributed to the mess in the first place remain.</p>\n<p>But just as it&rsquo;s committing to renewables, the Trump administration has been pressuring it to invest in more fossil fuels.

A delayed and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/15/16648924/puerto-rico-whitefish-contract-congress-investigation\">botched response</a> effort subsequently left millions of customers sans power for months. Without electricity, critical medical equipment shut off, food spoiled, drugs became unusable, and sanitation systems went offline, allowing infections to spread. An estimated <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/9/13/17855414/trump-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-death-toll\">2,975 people</a> died in the wake of the storm.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581009346_5660_55500\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6o_JTln25t_2GyrhlM-GORJxsoY=/0x0:3000x2001/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3VXUKHVQKylOZuZEf2l3YCX8HhU=/0x0:3000x2001/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hfPDjNsVCSNqFEXxcEZU9ieuUyw=/0x0:3000x2001/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVSJgvL1l0KGgA1RV1Y-PXUAqik=/0x0:3000x2001/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrjqR-m_Du_79UjkptUrKjxioto=/0x0:3000x2001/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sosNqkjEyHRCOJHaRZ46PT-3CBs=/0x0:3000x2001/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IaMZCZ1WuKW15WFAQhmx_K3q0M0=/0x0:3000x2001/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxHwdFwFYPe0a74flhhSgf-PiNE=/0x0:3000x2001/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOvEIs2bkSdXAYPR0iZmGvVrMU8=/0x0:3000x2001/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"Hurricane Maria knocked down 80 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s utility poles in 2017.\" data-upload-width=\"3000\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rTNc-z_nftF04dQ0b8aWEee8W3w=/0x0:3000x2001/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eokQaHtz7rDhxMzKWruQGsyy9pI=/0x0:3000x2001/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ygMz4WrgkEe7cGLoX1ktSUqdmU=/0x0:3000x2001/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5gCwMrF4UW3BjqgHSsEnVrFXPY=/0x0:3000x2001/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dy8ChXQYvAXszfVNxSlDzrv6sk0=/0x0:3000x2001/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sYBUlv-Ha-VNp036db1YT2CuZYo=/0x0:3000x2001/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ss_GES11UJnqM1_kQeMKAwYDqzo=/0x0:3000x2001/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3us9tXM7OPOwa2s7H14Wvcy-IQ=/0x0:3000x2001/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wlPv5WT-DXX3PsN05INFuhQ3zK4=/0x0:3000x2001/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAp19wcpyUBMFMoGBiVBC_7Nz94=/0x0:3000x2001/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x2001):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127994/GettyImages_853820824.jpg 1920w\"></img> </picture><figcaption>Hurricane Maria knocked down 80 percent of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s utility poles in 2017.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The final portion of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s devastated grid &mdash; an undersea power cable to the island of Culebra &mdash; was just reconnected last month, marking <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2019-03-21-puerto-rico-power-restored-hurricane-maria\">18 months</a> between the time when the storm hit and when power was fully restored.</p>\n<p>During the blackout, rumbling gasoline and diesel generators filled much of the electricity shortfall, but <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/19/16431312/elon-musk-richard-branson-clean-energy-puerto-rico-solar-batteries-microgrid\">renewable energy</a> also found its time to shine. Businesses, hospitals, and some homeowners installed their own <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/weary-of-power-outages-puerto-ricans-find-solace-in-solar-1537531200\">solar panels and batteries</a> rather than waiting for repair crews.</p>\n<p>But even before the storm, Puerto Rico&rsquo;s power grid was in dire shape. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the public utility in charge of the grid, had been struggling financially for years and was effectively bankrupt ahead of Hurricane Maria&rsquo;s landfall. And the island as a whole has been suffering from a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/05/02/607032585/how-puerto-ricos-debt-created-a-perfect-storm-before-the-storm\">debt crisis</a>.</p>\n<p>As a result, PREPA decided not to invoke mutual aid agreements the way Texas and Florida did ahead of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. These agreements help utilities secure assistance for reconstruction from other utilities after a natural disaster.</p>\n<p>PREPA officials said they were worried they would not be able to pay back repair crews. Instead, they opted for a reconstruction bidding process that was rife with allegations of mismanagement and corruption.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a big reason why reconstruction dragged on for so long. Though power has been restored now, many of the repairs are temporary fixes, and the risk of another destructive hurricane and ensuing blackout is growing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If we have another Maria again, we will have the same result,&rdquo; PREPA CEO Jos&eacute; Ortiz told House lawmakers last week. &ldquo;The difference is the response will be a lot quicker.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That means officials have to quickly figure out a more permanent solution to the energy problems. PREPA needs a business model that works and the power grid needs to stand up to the next storm. All the while, Puerto Rico is still constrained by its finances, and <a href=\"https://nca2018.globalchange.gov/chapter/20/\">climate change</a> is increasing the risks of future devastation.</p>\n<h3>Puerto Rico is betting on renewable energy, but it will be expensive </h3>\n<p>Before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico generated just <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=RQ\">2 percent</a> of its electricity from renewables. After the storm, some homeowners and businesses began to invest in rooftop solar power and batteries. The number of <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/rooftop-solar-nearly-doubles-in-puerto-rico-one-year-after-maria\">rooftop solar installations doubled</a> in the months since Maria made landfall.</p>\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s still a long way to 40 percent renewable energy, let alone 100 percent. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody has a clear answer for exactly how to get there,&rdquo; Wilson said.</p>\n<p>That said, Puerto Rico&rsquo;s new renewables mandate does remove many of the roadblocks that were blocking small-scale energy projects like rooftop solar. Installers, for example, don&rsquo;t have to get utility permits for photovoltaic arrays smaller than 25 kilowatts. New rules make it easier for neighborhood-scale renewable projects to connect to the larger power grid. And for larger wind and solar projects that do need regulatory approval, the process has been sped up, from years to months.</p>\n<p>The renewables law also adds a net-metering incentive for renewable energy installations up to 5 megawatts. That means if a homeowner or a co-op puts more power on the grid than they use over the course of a year, they can get a rebate from the power company.</p>\n<p>Wilson said he expects new renewable energy deployment to split evenly between distributed installations like rooftop solar and utility-scale projects like wind farms.</p>\n<p>However, getting the money to pay for it all is still a challenge. Companies are still trying to come up with a rooftop solar business model that would work in Puerto Rico, where homeowners are still trying to recover from storm damage and may not have the credit or cash needed to acquire a photovoltaic array. For larger-scale projects, financing is difficult for a utility and a government that are both effectively bankrupt. Puerto Ricans already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the United States, and power bills take up a larger share of incomes on the island than on the mainland.</p>\n<p>Some money for renewables has been earmarked in the post-Maria recovery effort. The Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated about $400 million for solar and energy storage in Puerto Rico, with funds to be disbursed later this year.</p>\n<p>The federal government, however, isn&rsquo;t as enthusiastic about Puerto Rico&rsquo;s commitment to renewable energy.</p>\n<p>US Department of Energy Assistant Secretary Bruce Walker warned the House Natural Resources Committee last week that Puerto Rico&rsquo;s aggressive clean energy goals could undermine the stability of its power grid.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;DOE believes increasing natural gas generating capacity in the San Juan area would be one of the single most valuable investment for PREPA&rsquo;s long-term recovery,&rdquo; Walker said in his prepared remarks. &ldquo;However, pursuing this investment may be at odds with the island&rsquo;s energy policy should the Governor choose to sign the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added that investing in a few natural gas power plants rather than thousands of distributed solar and wind energy projects would be more cost-effective, freeing up money for PREPA to perform much-needed repairs and upgrades to the power grid. Some of the funding for these plants could come from recovery aid.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PREPA is undergoing <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/puerto-rico-crisis/puerto-rico-officially-moves-privatize-power-grid-9-months-after-n885111\">privatization</a>. The move is expected to boost the utility&rsquo;s credit rating, helping it gather the money needed to transition toward cleaner energy and a more robust transmission system. However, Puerto Ricans are worried that private management could also lead to even higher utility bills. It would also give outside shareholders a say in where the utility invests, whether in renewables or fossil fuels. Analysts also say that privatization won&rsquo;t solve the corruption problems like graft and nepotism that have plagued the utility.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If the currently favored privatization process is limited to transferring a corrupt company in the public sector to a group of corrupt investors in the private sector, we will have achieved absolutely nothing,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://grupocne.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HNR-Hearing-Written-Testimony-April-9-2019.pdf\">Sergio Marxuach</a>, policy director at the Center for a New Economy, told House lawmakers last week.</p>\n<p>PREPA has requested $2.5 billion in funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make its power infrastructure more resilient to future disasters. Federal officials expect that Puerto Rico will receive <a href=\"https://apnews.com/e98583e243f54807a268822845455dfc\">$82 billion</a> over time in disaster recovery funds, but <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/trump-administration-doubles-down-opposition-puerto-rico-funding-drawing-criticism-n988181\">President Trump</a> has complained about the total amount and blamed Puerto Rico for its financial woes. So while Puerto Rico&rsquo;s government wants to aggressively shift to clean energy, it may not have the biggest say in its own destiny.</p>",

                "text": "Mario Tama/Getty Images\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 has placed a definitive bet on wind, water, and sunshine. Last week, he signed a bill, the Public Energy Policy Law of Puerto Rico, to power the island solely by renewable energy by 2050. Along the way, the island must draw 40 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2025 and give up coal by 2028.\nWe have designed a regulatory framework to transform our energy system to a resilient, reliable and robust one with fair and reasonable rates for all consumers. https://t.co/GGmX3o18fh\n\u2014 Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) April 12, 2019\nThis puts Puerto Rico in league with more than 90 cities, counties, and states like Hawaii and New Mexico that have set 100 percent clean energy targets. It also gives the territory a head start in bigger, more aggressive climate proposals like the Green New Deal.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that this will be, by leaps and bounds, the quickest transition to renewables that\u2019s ever happened anywhere on the planet,\u201d said P.J. Wilson, president of the Solar and Energy Storage Association of Puerto Rico. \u201cTo go from [2] percent today to 40 percent by five years from now will be the biggest challenge the renewable energy industry [in Puerto Rico] has ever faced, on top of a very challenging political situation and a challenging financial situation.\u201d\nIndeed, Puerto Rico will be pursuing an aggressive renewable energy target from a fragile position. It currently gets the bulk of its electricity from fossil fuels and its power grid has suffered from years of poor maintenance and neglect. As an island, it\u2019s isolated from a larger power grid, so there are few backup options if energy infrastructure fails.\nThis was all too apparent in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which left the island shrouded in the largest blackout in US history. Emerging from the chaos of the storm, Puerto Rico is now undergoing one of the sharpest and most abrupt changes to its energy system of any part of the United States. There is an opportunity here to build a cleaner and more resilient grid, but the factors that contributed to the mess in the first place remain.\nBut just as it\u2019s committing to renewables, the Trump administration has been pressuring it to invest in more fossil fuels. Let\u2019s break it down.\nAll of Puerto Rico\u2019s energy woes converged after Hurricane Maria\nThe past two years have been brutal for the 3 million Americans living in Puerto Rico.\nWhen Hurricane Maria tore through the island in 2017 with 175 mph winds, it knocked down 80 percent of the utility poles and damaged critical power generators. A delayed and botched response effort subsequently left millions of customers sans power for months. Without electricity, critical medical equipment shut off, food spoiled, drugs became unusable, and sanitation systems went offline, allowing infections to spread. An estimated 2,975 people died in the wake of the storm.\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\nThe final portion of Puerto Rico\u2019s devastated grid \u2014 an undersea power cable to the island of Culebra \u2014 was just reconnected last month, marking 18 months between the time when the storm hit and when power was fully restored.\nDuring the blackout, rumbling gasoline and diesel generators filled much of the electricity shortfall, but renewable energy also found its time to shine. Businesses, hospitals, and some homeowners installed their own solar panels and batteries rather than waiting for repair crews.\nBut even before the storm, Puerto Rico\u2019s power grid was in dire shape. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, the public utility in charge of the grid, had been struggling financially for years and was effectively bankrupt ahead of Hurricane Maria\u2019s landfall. And the island as a whole has been suffering from a debt crisis.\nAs a result, PREPA decided not to invoke mutual aid agreements the way Texas and Florida did ahead of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. These agreements help utilities secure assistance for reconstruction from other utilities after a natural disaster.\nPREPA officials said they were worried they would not be able to pay back repair crews. Instead, they opted for a reconstruction bidding process that was rife with allegations of mismanagement and corruption.\nThat\u2019s a big reason why reconstruction dragged on for so long. Though power has been restored now, many of the repairs are temporary fixes, and the risk of another destructive hurricane and ensuing blackout is growing.\n\u201cIf we have another Maria again, we will have the same result,\u201d PREPA CEO Jos\u00e9 Ortiz told House lawmakers last week. \u201cThe difference is the response will be a lot quicker.\u201d\nThat means officials have to quickly figure out a more permanent solution to the energy problems. PREPA needs a business model that works and the power grid needs to stand up to the next storm. All the while, Puerto Rico is still constrained by its finances, and climate change is increasing the risks of future devastation.\nPuerto Rico is betting on renewable energy, but it will be expensive\nBefore Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico generated just 2 percent of its electricity from renewables. After the storm, some homeowners and businesses began to invest in rooftop solar power and batteries. The number of rooftop solar installations doubled in the months since Maria made landfall.\nHowever, it\u2019s still a long way to 40 percent renewable energy, let alone 100 percent. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has a clear answer for exactly how to get there,\u201d Wilson said.\nThat said, Puerto Rico\u2019s new renewables mandate does remove many of the roadblocks that were blocking small-scale energy projects like rooftop solar. Installers, for example, don\u2019t have to get utility permits for photovoltaic arrays smaller than 25 kilowatts. New rules make it easier for neighborhood-scale renewable projects to connect to the larger power grid. And for larger wind and solar projects that do need regulatory approval, the process has been sped up, from years to months.\nThe renewables law also adds a net-metering incentive for renewable energy installations up to 5 megawatts. That means if a homeowner or a co-op puts more power on the grid than they use over the course of a year, they can get a rebate from the power company.\nWilson said he expects new renewable energy deployment to split evenly between distributed installations like rooftop solar and utility-scale projects like wind farms.\nHowever, getting the money to pay for it all is still a challenge. Companies are still trying to come up with a rooftop solar business model that would work in Puerto Rico, where homeowners are still trying to recover from storm damage and may not have the credit or cash needed to acquire a photovoltaic array. For larger-scale projects, financing is difficult for a utility and a government that are both effectively bankrupt. Puerto Ricans already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the United States, and power bills take up a larger share of incomes on the island than on the mainland.\nSome money for renewables has been earmarked in the post-Maria recovery effort. The Department of Housing and Urban Development allocated about $400 million for solar and energy storage in Puerto Rico, with funds to be disbursed later this year.\nThe federal government, however, isn\u2019t as enthusiastic about Puerto Rico\u2019s commitment to renewable energy.\nUS Department of Energy Assistant Secretary Bruce Walker warned the House Natural Resources Committee last week that Puerto Rico\u2019s aggressive clean energy goals could undermine the stability of its power grid.\n\u201cDOE believes increasing natural gas generating capacity in the San Juan area would be one of the single most valuable investment for PREPA\u2019s long-term recovery,\u201d Walker said in his prepared remarks. \u201cHowever, pursuing this investment may be at odds with the island\u2019s energy policy should the Governor choose to sign the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act.\u201d\nHe added that investing in a few natural gas power plants rather than thousands of distributed solar and wind energy projects would be more cost-effective, freeing up money for PREPA to perform much-needed repairs and upgrades to the power grid. Some of the funding for these plants could come from recovery aid.\nMeanwhile, PREPA is undergoing privatization. The move is expected to boost the utility\u2019s credit rating, helping it gather the money needed to transition toward cleaner energy and a more robust transmission system. However, Puerto Ricans are worried that private management could also lead to even higher utility bills. It would also give outside shareholders a say in where the utility invests, whether in renewables or fossil fuels. Analysts also say that privatization won\u2019t solve the corruption problems like graft and nepotism that have plagued the utility.\n\u201cIf the currently favored privatization process is limited to transferring a corrupt company in the public sector to a group of corrupt investors in the private sector, we will have achieved absolutely nothing,\u201d Sergio Marxuach, policy director at the Center for a New Economy, told House lawmakers last week.\nPREPA has requested $2.5 billion in funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to make its power infrastructure more resilient to future disasters. Federal officials expect that Puerto Rico will receive $82 billion over time in disaster recovery funds, but President Trump has complained about the total amount and blamed Puerto Rico for its financial woes. So while Puerto Rico\u2019s government wants to aggressively shift to clean energy, it may not have the biggest say in its own destiny.",

Most of the new divisions are in Maine, where Republican Gov. Paul LePage successfully pushed the legislature to <a href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/2011/06/03/news/augusta/school-consolidation%C2%A0penalties-eliminated-effective-2012-13/\">lift penalties</a> on communities that left regionalized districts. And some of the seceding districts are doing so for legitimate reasons such as &ldquo;shifting enrollments and geography,&rdquo; as EdBuild notes.</p>\n<p>But school secession is one of the more brazen examples of affluent communities using their political clout to fence out everyone else. And as leading school segregation writer Nikole Hannah-Jones <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/magazine/the-resegregation-of-jefferson-county.html\">wrote in 2017</a>, &ldquo;School secessions, at least in the South, trace their roots to the arsenal of tools that white communities deployed to resist the desegregation mandate of the Brown ruling.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>One high-profile secession case was blocked last year, but many others went through</h3>\n<p>Advocates who oppose this behavior got a big win in 2018 when a federal court blocked an Alabama community from leaving its district.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I wrote about a community called Gardendale, which took initial steps to leave the Jefferson County, Alabama, district. Gardendale is wealthier and much whiter than the rest of Jefferson County &mdash; but eight other communities had managed to secede from Jefferson County District, so Gardendale was just the next in line.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581009451_2613_36613\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umRJmWNH8SWpcCZFCca_vRR0HYc=/0x0:920x535/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/teJPzCg7AQdkaMYYWLtv7pfF_zI=/0x0:920x535/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EEFBSo6PzBtvqQqAWAJIHjPPm_8=/0x0:920x535/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EcKIc9l6CM_yBCzhyv_Se7XiZTs=/0x0:920x535/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wzIxq17vt7sH25AhDSnd9wlMmrE=/0x0:920x535/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nRcywmsISODlmdz9J4hkvOxxYU=/0x0:920x535/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ChHIth4owyQn9rpWikuRo3bAjs=/0x0:920x535/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CnMbn8NxYdMPvZ5h-WsCiRC6FGE=/0x0:920x535/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YWvQiUOW16zZLh3FdEMo0Wq8BIU=/0x0:920x535/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"\" data-upload-width=\"920\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5d4AoPdAvF9-m0eRp478xPKyl2M=/0x0:920x535/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MvBELFnUXNFbuCmmAzNCdhOs_1I=/0x0:920x535/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTIhzywQz-IFISSulUcQfhCHv4g=/0x0:920x535/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Qgc6T2rfGxKylYyAyN3jAs-Mek=/0x0:920x535/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mSTmGzGicNyRmwL9qctUEccVFNg=/0x0:920x535/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50Yx3PW0x0hCl4hm6vnUZSYKKxg=/0x0:920x535/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J8PkDxhpG4cihvkeDPMC1Vtn6E=/0x0:920x535/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5x9_-GT7TfF0skDoI_9JpY3ouqM=/0x0:920x535/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9F_bDtD5_3bOl0s1g56V7pRGJxk=/0x0:920x535/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uoq2D2BaDy2YtgFBZw0gV7rqEoI=/0x0:920x535/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:920x535):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16028105/district_borders.jpg 1920w\"></img> </picture></figure>\n<p>At first, it looked as if Gardendale would be able to make its own district. A district court judge, Madeline Haikala, said that even though Gardendale acted with the purpose of excluding black children, the new district could move forward. However, an appeals court said Haikala <a href=\"https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2018/02/federal_appeals_court_rules_ga.html\">should not have allowed</a> the secession to move forward, since the lines were being drawn with discriminatory intent.</p>\n<p>And that intent wasn&rsquo;t hard to find. Opponents of the move could merely search the Facebook page where Gardendale residents organized the secession. One of the organizers wrote that it would give them &ldquo;better control over the geographic composition of the student body.&rdquo; Another wrote, &ldquo;A look around at our community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our community. A look into our schools, and you&rsquo;ll see something totally different.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But this secession was blocked because Jefferson County was under a federal desegregation order, which is why federal courts were able to have oversight. In other cases, there is far less scrutiny and legal leverage to halt this type of behavior.</p>\n<h3>Secession is another way of putting up legal fences</h3>\n<p>While <em>Brown v. Board</em> is the Supreme Court case that gets all the attention for integrating schools in 1954, there&rsquo;s another case worth paying attention to.</p>\n<p>In 1974, the Court ruled in <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/73-434\"><em>Milliken v. Bradley</em></a> that unless school district lines were drawn with racist intent, districts didn&rsquo;t have to participate in any integration scheme. In other words, if you didn&rsquo;t want to attend school with certain people in your district, you just needed to find a way to put a district line between you and them.</p>\n<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much what white flight was. White families, who didn&rsquo;t want their kids to attend school with black kids, moved out to the suburbs &mdash; and the government <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/09/how-the-federal-government-built-white-suburbia/403321/\">financed the construction of those white-only suburbs</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods\">backing home loans for white people</a> who wanted to live in those white-only neighborhoods.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581009451_6832_36614\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw -

                "text": "In the past two decades, 128 communities have had a simple idea: to make their own school district.\nFor many of them, the underlying purpose was to draw a legal fence between their community and a poorer one. Because a large chunk of public education is funded using local property taxes, making your own district with your affluent neighbors means that you\u2019re able to hoard resources \u2014 and not share tax dollars with poorer communities of color.\nIn 2017, I wrote about how a surprising number of these efforts have succeeded.\nSince then, 10 more communities have seceded from their districts, according to a report from EdBuild. Another 17 communities are currently in the process of trying to secede. And two states \u2014 Indiana and North Carolina \u2014 have made it easier for these communities to form their own districts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disturbing trend. We\u2019re seeing legislators making this overtly permissible,\u201d said EdBuild CEO Rebecca Sibilia.\nTo be clear, school secession isn\u2019t a viral trend yet. Most of the new divisions are in Maine, where Republican Gov. Paul LePage successfully pushed the legislature to lift penalties on communities that left regionalized districts. And some of the seceding districts are doing so for legitimate reasons such as \u201cshifting enrollments and geography,\u201d as EdBuild notes.\nBut school secession is one of the more brazen examples of affluent communities using their political clout to fence out everyone else. And as leading school segregation writer Nikole Hannah-Jones wrote in 2017, \u201cSchool secessions, at least in the South, trace their roots to the arsenal of tools that white communities deployed to resist the desegregation mandate of the Brown ruling.\u201d\nOne high-profile secession case was blocked last year, but many others went through\nAdvocates who oppose this behavior got a big win in 2018 when a federal court blocked an Alabama community from leaving its district.\nIn 2017, I wrote about a community called Gardendale, which took initial steps to leave the Jefferson County, Alabama, district. Gardendale is wealthier and much whiter than the rest of Jefferson County \u2014 but eight other communities had managed to secede from Jefferson County District, so Gardendale was just the next in line.\nAt first, it looked as if Gardendale would be able to make its own district. A district court judge, Madeline Haikala, said that even though Gardendale acted with the purpose of excluding black children, the new district could move forward. However, an appeals court said Haikala should not have allowed the secession to move forward, since the lines were being drawn with discriminatory intent.\nAnd that intent wasn\u2019t hard to find. Opponents of the move could merely search the Facebook page where Gardendale residents organized the secession. One of the organizers wrote that it would give them \u201cbetter control over the geographic composition of the student body.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cA look around at our community sporting events, our churches are great snapshots of our community. A look into our schools, and you\u2019ll see something totally different.\u201d\nBut this secession was blocked because Jefferson County was under a federal desegregation order, which is why federal courts were able to have oversight. In other cases, there is far less scrutiny and legal leverage to halt this type of behavior.\nSecession is another way of putting up legal fences\nWhile Brown v. Board is the Supreme Court case that gets all the attention for integrating schools in 1954, there\u2019s another case worth paying attention to.\nIn 1974, the Court ruled in Milliken v. Bradley that unless school district lines were drawn with racist intent, districts didn\u2019t have to participate in any integration scheme. In other words, if you didn\u2019t want to attend school with certain people in your district, you just needed to find a way to put a district line between you and them.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much what white flight was. White families, who didn\u2019t want their kids to attend school with black kids, moved out to the suburbs \u2014 and the government financed the construction of those white-only suburbs, as well as backing home loans for white people who wanted to live in those white-only neighborhoods.\nWith school district secession, it isn\u2019t about moving to another place to get a district boundary between you and others.\nRather, it\u2019s often about people with political and economic clout building that line \u2014 according to their conception of the community\u2019s borders \u2014 and doing it under the guise of local control.\nCorrection: The original version of this article and the related map said 11 districts have seceded since 2000. The correct number is 10. EdBuild mistakenly counted an \u201congoing\u201d district \u2014 the Malibu School District \u2014 as \u201cseceded.\u201d Malibu is still currently still one district, and there have been no decisions thus far that carry any legal weight",

(Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is partly responsible for Barr&rsquo;s Tuesday night ruling, since he selected the case, <em>Matter of M-S-, </em>for attorney general review in October 2018.)</p>\n<p>If Barr&rsquo;s ruling is allowed to go into effect, which it is set to do in 90 days, the only way for an asylum seeker to be released from detention during the weeks or months it takes for her case to be heard by a judge would be for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to allow her to be released on parole. The ACLU has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1118331619268616192\">vowed to sue</a> to block the ruling.</p>\n<p>The ruling won&rsquo;t address the heart of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/4/11/18290677/border-immigration-illegal-asylum-central-america-mexico-trump\">current border crisis.</a> Families make up a majority of people crossing into the US without papers (for the first time ever, as far as anyone can tell), and ICE can&rsquo;t keep immigrant families in detention for more than a few weeks under the terms of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/6/20/17484546/executive-order-family-separation-flores-settlement-agreement-immigration\">Flores settlement</a>, which governs the care of children in immigration custody. Barr&rsquo;s ruling doesn&rsquo;t change that.</p>\n<p>For single adults seeking asylum, however, ICE&rsquo;s only consideration about holding them indefinitely if the ruling goes into effect will be whether it has the space to do so.</p>\n<p>That raises the stakes of a forthcoming battle that was already brewing between ICE, which has consistently <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18220323/immigration-detention-beds-congress-cap\">spent beyond its budget on detention</a>, and the Democratic House of Representatives, which is less willing to bail ICE out than its Republican predecessors.</p>\n<h3>Asylum seekers who crossed illegally had two options for release. Barr is taking one of them away.</h3>\n<p>Someone who comes to the US without papers &mdash; whether they present themselves at a port of entry (official border crossing), or enter between ports (committing the misdemeanor of illegal entry) and are apprehended by a border patrol agent &mdash; can be deported without a hearing.</p>\n<p>But if that migrant declares a fear of return to her home country or a desire to seek asylum, she has a right to a screening interview with an asylum officer. If the asylum officer determines she has a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/8/6/17501404/trump-asylum-separate-legal-definition\">&ldquo;credible fear&rdquo;</a> (a deliberately generous standard), she is allowed to formally apply for asylum before an immigration judge, in the same kind of hearing that immigrants apprehended while living in the US are entitled to.</p>\n<p>This ruling is about what happens between passing the screening interview and the full hearing. That can be a years-long wait when an immigrant isn&rsquo;t detained, but is generally a matter of weeks (or sometimes months) when an immigrant is held in detention.</p>\n<p>US law says that people who come without papers &ldquo;shall be detained&rdquo; after passing their screening interviews, unless the federal government decides to allow them out on parole.</p>\n<p>Federal regulations, however, say that there&rsquo;s a second way for people to get released from detention: most immigrants who are on an immigration judge&rsquo;s docket have the right to periodic &ldquo;redetermination&rdquo; of whether they have to stay in custody or not &mdash; in other words, to bond hearings &mdash; before their case is heard on the merits.</p>\n<p>People who come without papers to ports of entry are explicitly excluded from that regulation. People who arrive between ports of entry, crossing illegally, are not. So the question is whether asylum seekers who arrive illegally but pass their screening interviews are eligible for a bond hearing as well as parole, or just for parole at the discretion of ICE officials.</p>\n<p>In 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals, part of the immigration court system within the Department of Justice &mdash; ruled that asylum seekers had a right to both bond and parole. That&rsquo;s the ruling Barr <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1154747/download\">reversed Tuesday night,</a> citing a 2018 Supreme Court decision (which found that the Immigration and Nationality Act didn&rsquo;t give an immigrant the right to a bond hearing if the law said they &ldquo;shall be detained&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Had Barr not issued his ruling, there would have been a massive change in the other direction. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of asylum seekers that bond hearings for eligible asylum seekers had to be held within seven days of them passing the screening interview, an aggressive interpretation of &ldquo;periodic redetermination&rdquo; that almost certainly would have resulted in a lot of new hearings in overloaded immigration courts and a lot more releases from detention.</p>\n<p>The California ruling was delayed for 30 days for appeal. Instead, Barr swooped in and issued the ruling in the case the AG&rsquo;s office had had since October, obviating the judicial ruling.

                "text": "Karen Ducey/Getty Images\nAttorney General William Barr has unilaterally revoked the right of asylum seekers who enter the US illegally to ask an immigration judge for release on bond.\nThe decision, released Tuesday night, is the first time Barr has used the attorney general\u2019s power to issue binding precedent on the immigration courts that determine whether immigrants can be deported from the US \u2014 a power that has been used aggressively by President Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys general. (Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is partly responsible for Barr\u2019s Tuesday night ruling, since he selected the case, Matter of M-S-, for attorney general review in October 2018.)\nIf Barr\u2019s ruling is allowed to go into effect, which it is set to do in 90 days, the only way for an asylum seeker to be released from detention during the weeks or months it takes for her case to be heard by a judge would be for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to allow her to be released on parole. The ACLU has vowed to sue to block the ruling.\nThe ruling won\u2019t address the heart of the current border crisis. Families make up a majority of people crossing into the US without papers (for the first time ever, as far as anyone can tell), and ICE can\u2019t keep immigrant families in detention for more than a few weeks under the terms of the Flores settlement, which governs the care of children in immigration custody. Barr\u2019s ruling doesn\u2019t change that.\nFor single adults seeking asylum, however, ICE\u2019s only consideration about holding them indefinitely if the ruling goes into effect will be whether it has the space to do so.\nThat raises the stakes of a forthcoming battle that was already brewing between ICE, which has consistently spent beyond its budget on detention, and the Democratic House of Representatives, which is less willing to bail ICE out than its Republican predecessors.\nAsylum seekers who crossed illegally had two options for release. Barr is taking one of them away.\nSomeone who comes to the US without papers \u2014 whether they present themselves at a port of entry (official border crossing), or enter between ports (committing the misdemeanor of illegal entry) and are apprehended by a border patrol agent \u2014 can be deported without a hearing.\nBut if that migrant declares a fear of return to her home country or a desire to seek asylum, she has a right to a screening interview with an asylum officer. If the asylum officer determines she has a \u201ccredible fear\u201d (a deliberately generous standard), she is allowed to formally apply for asylum before an immigration judge, in the same kind of hearing that immigrants apprehended while living in the US are entitled to.\nThis ruling is about what happens between passing the screening interview and the full hearing. That can be a years-long wait when an immigrant isn\u2019t detained, but is generally a matter of weeks (or sometimes months) when an immigrant is held in detention.\nUS law says that people who come without papers \u201cshall be detained\u201d after passing their screening interviews, unless the federal government decides to allow them out on parole.\nFederal regulations, however, say that there\u2019s a second way for people to get released from detention: most immigrants who are on an immigration judge\u2019s docket have the right to periodic \u201credetermination\u201d of whether they have to stay in custody or not \u2014 in other words, to bond hearings \u2014 before their case is heard on the merits.\nPeople who come without papers to ports of entry are explicitly excluded from that regulation. People who arrive between ports of entry, crossing illegally, are not. So the question is whether asylum seekers who arrive illegally but pass their screening interviews are eligible for a bond hearing as well as parole, or just for parole at the discretion of ICE officials.\nIn 2005, the Board of Immigration Appeals, part of the immigration court system within the Department of Justice \u2014 ruled that asylum seekers had a right to both bond and parole. That\u2019s the ruling Barr reversed Tuesday night, citing a 2018 Supreme Court decision (which found that the Immigration and Nationality Act didn\u2019t give an immigrant the right to a bond hearing if the law said they \u201cshall be detained\u201d).\nHad Barr not issued his ruling, there would have been a massive change in the other direction. Earlier this month, a federal judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit brought by a group of asylum seekers that bond hearings for eligible asylum seekers had to be held within seven days of them passing the screening interview, an aggressive interpretation of \u201cperiodic redetermination\u201d that almost certainly would have resulted in a lot of new hearings in overloaded immigration courts and a lot more releases from detention.\nThe California ruling was delayed for 30 days for appeal. Instead, Barr swooped in and issued the ruling in the case the AG\u2019s office had had since October, obviating the judicial ruling. But Barr is giving DOJ and DHS 90 days to figure out how to implement his ruling, creating an opening for advocates to file another lawsuit, and get (they hope) yet another injunction against a Trump immigration policy, in the meantime.\nICE has no choice but to release families. The question is whether it will try to stay within budget, or detain more single adults.\nWe don\u2019t know exactly how many migrants are affected by Barr\u2019s ruling. Asylum officers are currently doing nearly 10,000 screening interviews a month, and nearly 90 percent of those asylum seekers pass. But we don\u2019t know how many of those screenings are of single adults, and how many are of families coming together.\nFamilies (and unaccompanied children, who are subject to a different legal process) have made up 60 percent of all migrants apprehended at the border over the past few months \u2014 and the specific needs and legal protections for those populations are at the heart of the current border crisis that is overwhelming border agents and local communities.\nAnd families are not affected by Barr\u2019s new ruling.\nUnder a 2015 revision to the 1997 Flores settlement, families can\u2019t be held in immigration detention indefinitely; the rule of thumb is that families are supposed to be released after about 20 days.\nThe Trump administration desperately wants Congress to override that ruling to allow family detention until cases are completed, and is working on a regulation that would supersede it. But in the meantime, ICE is obligated to release families itself, on parole, if necessary to comply.\nIn theory, ICE is supposed to consider parole in most cases \u2014 not just when obligated to by a lawsuit \u2014 and make its decisions based on who it most needs to be holding in immigration detention.\nThe funding deal Congress passed in February gives ICE funding to keep an average of 45,274 migrants in custody through the end of September \u2014 but ICE was supposed to use that money to gradually reduce the 49,000-plus people it had in detention at the time to the 40,520 that Congress had actually authorized (and ICE had violated) in prior years.\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that ICE is making any more of an effort to live within its means; a few weeks after Congress passed its bill, immigration detention shot above 50,000 for the first time ever. That indicates that Barr\u2019s ruling will have an impact on single adults seeking asylum \u2014 since ICE may not be inclined to release them if it doesn\u2019t have to, and a judge can no longer compel that release.\nIf ICE spends its detention budget even faster now, though, it just accelerates a coming confrontation with Congress when the money runs out.\nHouse Democrats aren\u2019t as likely to pass \u201csupplemental\u201d funding bills for ICE to replenish an exhausted detention budget as their Republican peers were. And while DHS has some power to move funds from one agency to another \u2014 a power it used to send some money from FEMA to ICE last year, for example \u2014 it is supposed to notify Congress when that happens, and, in theory, to ask for Congress\u2019s approval.\nDemocrats have all but said that if ICE doesn\u2019t reduce its detention population as instructed, they\u2019ll try to block those transfers of funds. (They may not be able to \u2014 they weren\u2019t able to block the transfer of $1 billion by the Pentagon to help pay for additional border barriers, for example.)\nBarr\u2019s ruling shouldn\u2019t be seen as a response to Trump\u2019s most recent temper tantrum over the border, which has led him to threats to close the border entirely and a (possibly ongoing) purge of top leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.\nIt was in the works before Sessions resigned, and it\u2019s the latest example of something Sessions pioneered during his two years as Attorney General: using the power the AG has over the immigration court system to reshape immigration law in a more hawkish direction.\nSo far, Trump\u2019s attorneys general have opened the door to the reopening of hundreds of thousands of closed deportation cases; ruled that judges can\u2019t delay a hearing to wait for, say, an immigrant\u2019s application for a visa to get approved; and severely narrowed the grounds on which survivors of domestic and gang violence can qualify for asylum. (The last of these has been partly put on hold by a federal judge.)\nAnd a case that former acting Attorney General Whittaker referred to himself, that Barr hasn\u2019t yet released a ruling on, could change asylum grounds even more radically \u2014 by preventing someone from qualifying for asylum by arguing that his family is persecuted in his home country.\nTrump has focused his attention and frustration at the Department of Homeland Security. But DHS is constrained both by limited resources, and by some hard limits in immigration law.\nDOJ\u2019s restrictions, when it comes to self-referral, aren\u2019t nearly as hard and fast. Barr might have more power than whoever Trump nominates to replace purged Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. And his Tuesday ruling indicates he intends to use it.",

and one of the fastest-growing &mdash; had its moment in the spotlight Sunday during the 91st Academy Awards ceremony.</p>\n<p>As he received an Oscar for the movie <em>Roma</em>, Mexican director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n paid tribute to millions of housekeepers and nannies who spend their lives taking care of other families.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to thank the Academy for recognizing a film centered around an indigenous woman, one of the 70 million domestic workers around the world without work rights, historically relegated to the background of the cinema,&rdquo; he said during his acceptance speech for the Best Director award.</p>\n<p>The movie&rsquo;s central character, Cleo, is a housekeeper of Mixtec heritage (one of Mexico&rsquo;s largest indigenous groups) who works for an affluent family in 1970s Mexico City. The portrayal of Cleo by Yalitza Aparicio, an indigenous actress from Oaxaca, drew international praise and sparked discussions about the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-mn-oscars-roma-20190225-story.html\">lack of indigenous representation</a> in pop culture. The movie also drew applause from housekeepers, nannies, and other domestic workers who often feel invisible in the global economy.</p>\n<p>Domestic workers in the US are taking advantage of the <em>Roma</em> buzz to raise awareness about their second-class status in the US workforce. They want the public to realize that housekeepers, nannies, and home health aides have fewer rights than other workers: Most of them aren&rsquo;t protected from sexual harassment and discrimination under federal law, and they don&rsquo;t have the right to unionize. They&rsquo;ve been campaigning to change that, and now they&rsquo;ve enlisted Hollywood&rsquo;s help.</p>\n<p>Last week, Cuar&oacute;n <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nK2jmHiq9Vc\">recorded a public service announcement</a> supporting the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, a congressional bill that would give all domestic workers the same legal rights afforded to other workers, plus some new ones: paid sick days, regular scheduling, and retirement benefits.</p>\n<p>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/opinions/domestic-workers-bill-of-rights-harris-poo-jayapal/index.html\">plan to introduce the bill</a> this spring, according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents about 2 million nannies, housekeepers, and home health aides across the country.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This [bill] will provide us with the respect, dignity, and recognition that we all deserve,&rdquo; June Barrett, a home health aide from South Florida, told me. Barrett has been advocating for the bill, and got the chance to meet Cuar&oacute;n Sunday in Hollywood during a red carpet event for domestic workers. She&rsquo;s worked as a nanny and housekeeper for more than 14 years, she told me, and said the story of Cleo in <em>Roma</em> was her story, too, and the story of millions of poor women who leave their own families to take care of someone else&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>The domestic workers&rsquo; campaign is part of a broader effort to mobilize an isolated workforce that is often overlooked and exploited under the law. It&rsquo;s also an attempt to gain economic security for one of the fastest-growing and lowest paid occupations in the US.</p>\n<h3>Domestic workers are in high demand, but have little leverage</h3>\n<p>Only one industry is expected to grow faster and add more jobs to the US economy than domestic work in the coming years: the renewable energy business.</p>\n<p>After that, home health aides and personal care assistants are expected to be the fastest-growing occupations within the next decade &mdash; with about 1.2 million new positions added to the US economy between 2016 and 2026, according to the latest estimates from the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>\n<p>That spike is expected for two main reasons. First, the baby boomer generation is aging, and a growing number of families will likely hire aides to help care for them at home. Second, the expansion of Medicaid insurance under the Affordable Care Act has made it possible for more low-income families to cover the cost of home care services.</p>\n<p>But even though domestic workers are in high demand, they are among the lowest-paid workers in the country, and most get no benefits. The median annual salary for a home health aide was <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm\">$23,000 in 2017</a>, slightly above the $20,420 federal poverty level for a family of three. About <a href=\"https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/07629465-7b13-4c55-91b4-6de11a824f15\">88 percent</a> of domestic workers don&rsquo;t have paid time off or other benefits either.</p>\n<p>Congress is largely to blame for this.</p>\n<h3>Congress intentionally left out domestic workers from US labor laws</h3>\n<p>When Congress first passed federal labor protections in the 1930s as part of the New Deal, they excluded two groups of workers: domestic workers and farm workers.</p>\n<p>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, excluded both groups from the right to earn the minimum wage or get overtime pay. Farmworkers and domestic workers were left out as a concession to Southern lawmakers, whose states were highly invested in paying low wages to personal servants.</p>\n<p>At the time, that workforce was overwhelmingly black and Latinx, and excluding them from a minimum wage was intentional. Today, <a href=\"https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/sites/default/files/NAWS%20data%20factsht%201-13-15FINAL.pdf\"><strong>about a quarter</strong></a> of farmworkers and 67 percent of housekeepers earn less than the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Lawmakers later amended the FLSA in the 1970s to cover most domestic workers, but not live-in housekeepers and nannies. Farmworkers are still excluded from the law.</p>\n<p>Both groups were also excluded from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which gave workers the right to form labor unions and organize for better working conditions.</p>\n<p>Then, when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, domestic workers were left out inadvertently. The law didn&rsquo;t include protections for workers whose employers have fewer than 15 employees. That means it&rsquo;s technically legal for employers to sexually harass their nannies and housekeepers, or to discriminate against them based on race, religion, gender, or national origin.</p>\n<p>The same thing happened a few years later, in 1970, when Congress passed the <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/toc\">Occupational Health and Safety Act</a>. The landmark labor law, which established a worker&rsquo;s right to a safe and healthy work environment, also left out domestic workers and farmworkers.</p>\n<p>This is not a tiny part of the workforce. More than 12 million US workers &mdash; about 10 percent of the workforce &mdash; worked for firms with fewer than 10 employees in 2017, according to data from the Department of Labor (the data set does not have a category for firms with fewer than 15 employees).</p>\n<p>Millions of them are housekeepers, nannies, home health care aides, and other occupations made up mostly of women of color. They&rsquo;re also farmworkers who harvest crops at small family farms.</p>\n<p>These overlooked workers are now demanding equal treatment from Congress. Last week, House Democrats introduced the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1080?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HR+1080%22%5D%7D&s=2&r=1\">Fairness for Farm Workers Act,</a> which would give agriculture workers the same minimum wage and overtime protections as the rest of the US workforce. Domestic workers are also campaigning for equal rights under federal law.</p>\n<h3>The Domestic Workers Bill of Rights would close the loopholes</h3>\n<p>The fact that housekeepers and nannies can&rsquo;t unionize has made it hard for them to fight congressional efforts to exclude them from labor protections. So instead, they began organizing at the national level in 2007, launching the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The nonprofit group advocates for housekeepers across the country, and has pushed change at the state level.</p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://www.bna.com/seattle-city-council-n73014481034/\">eight states</a> have passed laws extending labor protections to domestic workers: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Nevada. In July, the city of Seattle did too.</p>\n<p>Now the group is taking their campaign to Capitol Hill. Hundreds of domestic workers have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/26/17275708/housekeepers-nannies-sexual-harassment-laws\">been traveling to Washington, DC,</a> in the past year to talk to lawmakers about their need for federal labor protections. In April, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/26/17275708/housekeepers-nannies-sexual-harassment-laws\">a group of them</a> met with Harris, Jayapal, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).</p>\n<p>In November, Harris and Jayapal <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/opinions/domestic-workers-bill-of-rights-harris-poo-jayapal/index.html\">announced their plan</a> to introduce the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. They are currently drafting the bill, and domestic workers expect it to be introduced this spring.</p>\n<p>The bill would close all the loopholes in federal labor laws that exclude domestic workers. It would also require employers to give them meal breaks, rest breaks, and some paid sick days. In addition, employers would have to establish fair scheduling practices and a system for workers to report sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Passing this Bill of Rights will demonstrate that domestic work is not only work, but work that is critical to our economy and society,&rdquo; wrote <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/opinions/domestic-workers-bill-of-rights-harris-poo-jayapal/index.html\">Harris, Jayapal, and Ai-Jen Poo in a November</a> op-ed for CNN. &ldquo;We must extend protections to those who have been silenced and overlooked for decades.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Domestic workers are not so silent anymore. Not only have they persuaded high-profile Democrats in Congress to join their cause, they now have Hollywood on their side too.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, attended the Oscars ceremony as Cuar&oacute;n&rsquo;s guest. The group also hosted a red carpet event for dozens of domestic workers from around the country.</p>\n<p>Barrett, the home health aide from Florida, told me she attended the event and met Cuar&oacute;n.</p>\n<p>She said she kissed the Oscar trophy he received for directing <em>Roma</em>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought that a girl from Jamaica with no parents, who&rsquo;s been raped and abused, would ever be able to have that opportunity?&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s power in organizing and power in telling our stories.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2> In This Stream </h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/12/12/18127861/oscars-2019-news-updates-winners\"> View all 56 stories </a></p>",

                "text": "Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\nOne of the most thankless professions in the US \u2014 and one of the fastest-growing \u2014 had its moment in the spotlight Sunday during the 91st Academy Awards ceremony.\nAs he received an Oscar for the movie Roma, Mexican director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n paid tribute to millions of housekeepers and nannies who spend their lives taking care of other families.\n\u201cI want to thank the Academy for recognizing a film centered around an indigenous woman, one of the 70 million domestic workers around the world without work rights, historically relegated to the background of the cinema,\u201d he said during his acceptance speech for the Best Director award.\nThe movie\u2019s central character, Cleo, is a housekeeper of Mixtec heritage (one of Mexico\u2019s largest indigenous groups) who works for an affluent family in 1970s Mexico City. The portrayal of Cleo by Yalitza Aparicio, an indigenous actress from Oaxaca, drew international praise and sparked discussions about the lack of indigenous representation in pop culture. The movie also drew applause from housekeepers, nannies, and other domestic workers who often feel invisible in the global economy.\nDomestic workers in the US are taking advantage of the Roma buzz to raise awareness about their second-class status in the US workforce. They want the public to realize that housekeepers, nannies, and home health aides have fewer rights than other workers: Most of them aren\u2019t protected from sexual harassment and discrimination under federal law, and they don\u2019t have the right to unionize. They\u2019ve been campaigning to change that, and now they\u2019ve enlisted Hollywood\u2019s help.\nLast week, Cuar\u00f3n recorded a public service announcement supporting the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, a congressional bill that would give all domestic workers the same legal rights afforded to other workers, plus some new ones: paid sick days, regular scheduling, and retirement benefits.\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) plan to introduce the bill this spring, according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents about 2 million nannies, housekeepers, and home health aides across the country.\n\u201cThis [bill] will provide us with the respect, dignity, and recognition that we all deserve,\u201d June Barrett, a home health aide from South Florida, told me. Barrett has been advocating for the bill, and got the chance to meet Cuar\u00f3n Sunday in Hollywood during a red carpet event for domestic workers. She\u2019s worked as a nanny and housekeeper for more than 14 years, she told me, and said the story of Cleo in Roma was her story, too, and the story of millions of poor women who leave their own families to take care of someone else\u2019s.\nThe domestic workers\u2019 campaign is part of a broader effort to mobilize an isolated workforce that is often overlooked and exploited under the law. It\u2019s also an attempt to gain economic security for one of the fastest-growing and lowest paid occupations in the US.\nDomestic workers are in high demand, but have little leverage\nOnly one industry is expected to grow faster and add more jobs to the US economy than domestic work in the coming years: the renewable energy business.\nAfter that, home health aides and personal care assistants are expected to be the fastest-growing occupations within the next decade \u2014 with about 1.2 million new positions added to the US economy between 2016 and 2026, according to the latest estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThat spike is expected for two main reasons. First, the baby boomer generation is aging, and a growing number of families will likely hire aides to help care for them at home. Second, the expansion of Medicaid insurance under the Affordable Care Act has made it possible for more low-income families to cover the cost of home care services.\nBut even though domestic workers are in high demand, they are among the lowest-paid workers in the country, and most get no benefits. The median annual salary for a home health aide was $23,000 in 2017, slightly above the $20,420 federal poverty level for a family of three. About 88 percent of domestic workers don\u2019t have paid time off or other benefits either.\nCongress is largely to blame for this.\nCongress intentionally left out domestic workers from US labor laws\nWhen Congress first passed federal labor protections in the 1930s as part of the New Deal, they excluded two groups of workers: domestic workers and farm workers.\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, excluded both groups from the right to earn the minimum wage or get overtime pay. Farmworkers and domestic workers were left out as a concession to Southern lawmakers, whose states were highly invested in paying low wages to personal servants.\nAt the time, that workforce was overwhelmingly black and Latinx, and excluding them from a minimum wage was intentional. Today, about a quarter of farmworkers and 67 percent of housekeepers earn less than the minimum wage.\nLawmakers later amended the FLSA in the 1970s to cover most domestic workers, but not live-in housekeepers and nannies. Farmworkers are still excluded from the law.\nBoth groups were also excluded from the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which gave workers the right to form labor unions and organize for better working conditions.\nThen, when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, domestic workers were left out inadvertently. The law didn\u2019t include protections for workers whose employers have fewer than 15 employees. That means it\u2019s technically legal for employers to sexually harass their nannies and housekeepers, or to discriminate against them based on race, religion, gender, or national origin.\nThe same thing happened a few years later, in 1970, when Congress passed the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The landmark labor law, which established a worker\u2019s right to a safe and healthy work environment, also left out domestic workers and farmworkers.\nThis is not a tiny part of the workforce. More than 12 million US workers \u2014 about 10 percent of the workforce \u2014 worked for firms with fewer than 10 employees in 2017, according to data from the Department of Labor (the data set does not have a category for firms with fewer than 15 employees).\nMillions of them are housekeepers, nannies, home health care aides, and other occupations made up mostly of women of color. They\u2019re also farmworkers who harvest crops at small family farms.\nThese overlooked workers are now demanding equal treatment from Congress. Last week, House Democrats introduced the Fairness for Farm Workers Act, which would give agriculture workers the same minimum wage and overtime protections as the rest of the US workforce. Domestic workers are also campaigning for equal rights under federal law.\nThe Domestic Workers Bill of Rights would close the loopholes\nThe fact that housekeepers and nannies can\u2019t unionize has made it hard for them to fight congressional efforts to exclude them from labor protections. So instead, they began organizing at the national level in 2007, launching the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The nonprofit group advocates for housekeepers across the country, and has pushed change at the state level.\nSo far, eight states have passed laws extending labor protections to domestic workers: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii, and Nevada. In July, the city of Seattle did too.\nNow the group is taking their campaign to Capitol Hill. Hundreds of domestic workers have been traveling to Washington, DC, in the past year to talk to lawmakers about their need for federal labor protections. In April, a group of them met with Harris, Jayapal, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).\nIn November, Harris and Jayapal announced their plan to introduce the National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights. They are currently drafting the bill, and domestic workers expect it to be introduced this spring.\nThe bill would close all the loopholes in federal labor laws that exclude domestic workers. It would also require employers to give them meal breaks, rest breaks, and some paid sick days. In addition, employers would have to establish fair scheduling practices and a system for workers to report sexual harassment.\n\u201cPassing this Bill of Rights will demonstrate that domestic work is not only work, but work that is critical to our economy and society,\u201d wrote Harris, Jayapal, and Ai-Jen Poo in a November op-ed for CNN. \u201cWe must extend protections to those who have been silenced and overlooked for decades.\u201d\nDomestic workers are not so silent anymore. Not only have they persuaded high-profile Democrats in Congress to join their cause, they now have Hollywood on their side too.\nOn Sunday, Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, attended the Oscars ceremony as Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s guest. The group also hosted a red carpet event for dozens of domestic workers from around the country.\nBarrett, the home health aide from Florida, told me she attended the event and met Cuar\u00f3n.\nShe said she kissed the Oscar trophy he received for directing Roma.\n\u201cWho would have thought that a girl from Jamaica with no parents, who\u2019s been raped and abused, would ever be able to have that opportunity?\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s power in organizing and power in telling our stories.\u201d\nIn This Stream\nView all 56 stories",

After the first crash, the FAA learned the plane&rsquo;s flight control system could adjust the plane&rsquo;s horizontal tail, pushing down the plane&rsquo;s nose, to a much greater degree than the initial documents stated.</p>\n<p>The flight control system has now been implicated in two fatal plane crashes: the Ethiopian Airlines crash last week that killed 157 people and the Lion Air crash in October that killed 189. The 737 MAX has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18264348/trump-boeing-737-max-faa-emergency-order\">grounded across the globe</a> since last week &mdash; a decision the FAA was slow to make even as other countries blocked the plane from their airspace.</p>\n<p>The Seattle Times&rsquo;s investigation by Dominic Gates reveals how the FAA increasingly delegated inspections and other safety checks to the company itself and pushed inspectors to hand off even more of those tasks as the process continued, a practice that became more common because of FAA budget cuts and that has been formalized by Congress in the appropriations bills lawmakers have passed. As the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/business/boeing-flights-grounded.html\">reported recently</a>, the agency created a program in 2005 that allowed manufacturers like Boeing to choose their own employees for critical work in certifying new planes were safe to fly.</p>\n<p>The FAA and Boeing have pledged to implement a &ldquo;software enhancement&rdquo; for the flight control system by April. But scrutiny over what went wrong with the 737 MAX is only just beginning: The Department of Transportation is investigating the FAA, and a grand jury in DC is <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/faas-737-max-approval-is-probed-11552868400?mod=hp_major_pos13&mod=article_inline\">issuing subpoenas</a>. All this is playing out as the FAA is without a permanent leader &mdash; a post Trump reportedly once wanted filled by his <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/14/trump-wanted-his-personal-pilot-head-faa-critical-job-is-still-vacant-amid-boeing-fallout/?utm_term=.de1add1a6807\">personal pilot</a>.</p>\n<h3>Boeing wanted to keep costs down and get its plane in the air</h3>\n<p>The Seattle Times investigation offers an extremely detailed and technical review of the expansive role Boeing was allowed to take in certifying the safety of its own aircraft and getting the 737 MAX in the air.</p>\n<p>This included the crucial decision not to train pilots on the new flight control system or mention it in flight manuals because it was only supposed to take control in extreme circumstances.</p>\n<p>Pilots were only told about the system after the Lion Air crash in October, according to the Times, while an unnamed FAA safety engineer told Gates that the lack of knowledge about the MCAS system might have factored into the Indonesian crash.</p>\n<p>The decision not to fully train pilots on MCAS was made partly as a cost-saving measure, the Times reported:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Minimizing MAX pilot transition training was an important cost saving for Boeing&rsquo;s airline customers, a key selling point for the jet, which has racked up more than 5,000 orders.</p> <p>The company&rsquo;s website pitched the jet to airlines with a promise that &ldquo;as you build your 737 MAX fleet, millions of dollars will be saved because of its commonality with the Next-Generation 737.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>The investigation lays bare the close relationship between the aircraft manufacturer and the FAA. According to the Times, as Boeing rushed to catch up with its competitor Airbus, managers pushed the agency&rsquo;s technical experts to hasten their work. More and more work was delegated back to Boeing, Gates reported:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>A former FAA safety engineer who was directly involved in certifying the MAX said that halfway through the certification process, &ldquo;we were asked by management to re-evaluate what would be delegated. Management thought we had retained too much at the FAA.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;There was constant pressure to re-evaluate our initial decisions,&rdquo; the former engineer said. &ldquo;And even after we had reassessed it &hellip; there was continued discussion by management about delegating even more items down to the Boeing Company.&rdquo;</p> <p>Even the work that was retained, such as reviewing technical documents provided by Boeing, was sometimes curtailed.</p> <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a complete and proper review of the documents,&rdquo; the former engineer added. &ldquo;Review was rushed to reach certain certification dates.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>FAA regulatory oversight has worked this way for years, and the United States has had a sterling record of aviation safety for much of that time. But the recent crashes, and a fuller understanding of the role Boeing has played in regulating itself, have brought concerns that had simmered for years to the fore.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/18/air-disasters-faa-boeing-737-1279992\">Politico reported</a> this week, lawmakers have fretted for a while about a &ldquo;culture of coziness&rdquo; between the FAA and the aircraft manufacturers. The agency has at times referred to the companies under its jurisdiction as &ldquo;customers,&rdquo; drawing the ire of former Rep. James Oberstar (D-MN) a decade ago.</p>\n<p>Repeated warnings have been issued over the years in reports from federal oversight authorities about the close relationships between the FAA and Boeing specifically. From Politico:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>But DOT&rsquo;s inspector general said in a <a href=\"https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Oversight%20of%20ODA%20Final%20Report%5E10-15-15.pdf\">2015 audit</a> that the agency didn&rsquo;t know whether it had enough staff in the largest FAA office that oversees this work &mdash; the one that deals with Boeing.</p> <p>In a separate 2012 report, the department&rsquo;s IG found that agency managers&rsquo; alleged close relationship with Boeing was creating unrest among FAA employees. Some of those workers charged that their supervisors &ldquo;have not always supported ... employee efforts to hold Boeing accountable,&rdquo; according to a copy of the report that was earlier <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-18/boeing-had-too-much-sway-checking-own-planes-faa-workers-warned\">obtained</a> by Bloomberg.&ldquo;We do not like the fact that a new system was put on the aircraft and wasn&rsquo;t disclosed to anyone or put in the manuals,&rdquo; Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told the Times previously, describing his members as being &ldquo;kept in the dark&rdquo; by Boeing.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Lawmakers have promised to look into the crash and the circumstances that led to it. A federal grand jury is reportedly taking up the case. More than 300 people are dead, and answers will be demanded to explain how a system with such a strong reputation for safety may have allowed such tragedies to happen.</p>",

                "text": "In a hurry to finish design and manufacture of the Boeing 737 MAX, the new plane that has crashed twice in the past six months, and get the plane to the runway, both Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration appear to have rushed and cut corners \u2014 including not mentioning to pilots they had installed a new flight control system on the updated aircraft.\nThe result, according to a lengthy and damning Seattle Times investigation, was that the company\u2019s safety analysis understated how much control the system could exert in flight and failed to account for how a pilot\u2019s actions might influence the system\u2019s behavior. After the first crash, the FAA learned the plane\u2019s flight control system could adjust the plane\u2019s horizontal tail, pushing down the plane\u2019s nose, to a much greater degree than the initial documents stated.\nThe flight control system has now been implicated in two fatal plane crashes: the Ethiopian Airlines crash last week that killed 157 people and the Lion Air crash in October that killed 189. The 737 MAX has been grounded across the globe since last week \u2014 a decision the FAA was slow to make even as other countries blocked the plane from their airspace.\nThe Seattle Times\u2019s investigation by Dominic Gates reveals how the FAA increasingly delegated inspections and other safety checks to the company itself and pushed inspectors to hand off even more of those tasks as the process continued, a practice that became more common because of FAA budget cuts and that has been formalized by Congress in the appropriations bills lawmakers have passed. As the New York Times reported recently, the agency created a program in 2005 that allowed manufacturers like Boeing to choose their own employees for critical work in certifying new planes were safe to fly.\nThe FAA and Boeing have pledged to implement a \u201csoftware enhancement\u201d for the flight control system by April. But scrutiny over what went wrong with the 737 MAX is only just beginning: The Department of Transportation is investigating the FAA, and a grand jury in DC is issuing subpoenas. All this is playing out as the FAA is without a permanent leader \u2014 a post Trump reportedly once wanted filled by his personal pilot.\nBoeing wanted to keep costs down and get its plane in the air\nThe Seattle Times investigation offers an extremely detailed and technical review of the expansive role Boeing was allowed to take in certifying the safety of its own aircraft and getting the 737 MAX in the air.\nThis included the crucial decision not to train pilots on the new flight control system or mention it in flight manuals because it was only supposed to take control in extreme circumstances.\nPilots were only told about the system after the Lion Air crash in October, according to the Times, while an unnamed FAA safety engineer told Gates that the lack of knowledge about the MCAS system might have factored into the Indonesian crash.\nThe decision not to fully train pilots on MCAS was made partly as a cost-saving measure, the Times reported:\nMinimizing MAX pilot transition training was an important cost saving for Boeing\u2019s airline customers, a key selling point for the jet, which has racked up more than 5,000 orders.\nThe company\u2019s website pitched the jet to airlines with a promise that \u201cas you build your 737 MAX fleet, millions of dollars will be saved because of its commonality with the Next-Generation 737.\u201d\nThe investigation lays bare the close relationship between the aircraft manufacturer and the FAA. According to the Times, as Boeing rushed to catch up with its competitor Airbus, managers pushed the agency\u2019s technical experts to hasten their work. More and more work was delegated back to Boeing, Gates reported:\nA former FAA safety engineer who was directly involved in certifying the MAX said that halfway through the certification process, \u201cwe were asked by management to re-evaluate what would be delegated. Management thought we had retained too much at the FAA.\u201d\n\u201cThere was constant pressure to re-evaluate our initial decisions,\u201d the former engineer said. \u201cAnd even after we had reassessed it \u2026 there was continued discussion by management about delegating even more items down to the Boeing Company.\u201d\nEven the work that was retained, such as reviewing technical documents provided by Boeing, was sometimes curtailed.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a complete and proper review of the documents,\u201d the former engineer added. \u201cReview was rushed to reach certain certification dates.\u201d\nFAA regulatory oversight has worked this way for years, and the United States has had a sterling record of aviation safety for much of that time. But the recent crashes, and a fuller understanding of the role Boeing has played in regulating itself, have brought concerns that had simmered for years to the fore.\nAs Politico reported this week, lawmakers have fretted for a while about a \u201cculture of coziness\u201d between the FAA and the aircraft manufacturers. The agency has at times referred to the companies under its jurisdiction as \u201ccustomers,\u201d drawing the ire of former Rep. James Oberstar (D-MN) a decade ago.\nRepeated warnings have been issued over the years in reports from federal oversight authorities about the close relationships between the FAA and Boeing specifically. From Politico:\nBut DOT\u2019s inspector general said in a 2015 audit that the agency didn\u2019t know whether it had enough staff in the largest FAA office that oversees this work \u2014 the one that deals with Boeing.\nIn a separate 2012 report, the department\u2019s IG found that agency managers\u2019 alleged close relationship with Boeing was creating unrest among FAA employees. Some of those workers charged that their supervisors \u201chave not always supported ... employee efforts to hold Boeing accountable,\u201d according to a copy of the report that was earlier obtained by Bloomberg.\u201cWe do not like the fact that a new system was put on the aircraft and wasn\u2019t disclosed to anyone or put in the manuals,\u201d Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, told the Times previously, describing his members as being \u201ckept in the dark\u201d by Boeing.\nLawmakers have promised to look into the crash and the circumstances that led to it. A federal grand jury is reportedly taking up the case. More than 300 people are dead, and answers will be demanded to explain how a system with such a strong reputation for safety may have allowed such tragedies to happen.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) speaks during a campaign event on March 8, 2019, in Queens, New York.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272486/elizabeth-warren-electoral-college-2020-presidential-election\">During Sen. Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s (D-MA) town hall event on Monday night</a>, she floated a seemingly radical idea to make voting more equitable: abolishing the Electoral College.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We need to make sure that every vote counts,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the Electoral College, and everybody ... I think everybody ought to have to come and ask for your vote.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/3/19/18272486/elizabeth-warren-electoral-college-2020-presidential-election\">As Vox&rsquo;s Ella Nilsen reports,</a> Warren&rsquo;s idea earned loud applause. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, are among the 2020 Democratic hopefuls backing this idea.</p>\n<p>Because of the Electoral College, swing states like Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio tend to receive an outsized focus during campaigns. This emphasis means that certain other states are neglected by candidates and very rarely the linchpins in any presidential electoral decision.</p>\n<p>This set-up ends up weighing the votes in swing states more heavily than those in places that predictably tend to fall on one side of the aisle. Swing state votes could decide an election, whereas ones in more solidly liberal or conservative states would be expected to break a particular way. It&rsquo;s an arrangement that&rsquo;s raised more questions after candidates in recent elections (Hillary Clinton and Al Gore) won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.</p>\n<p>Defenders of the system argue that removing it would give populous urban centers disproportionate power to decide elections compared to more rural areas, while proponents note that it would simply give each vote the same weight.</p>\n<h3>Sure, the Electoral College is unpopular with Democrats, but how would you actually get rid of it? </h3>\n<p>To ditch the Electoral College entirely, the US would have to pass a constitutional amendment (passed by two-thirds of the House and Senate and approved by 38 states) &mdash; or convene a constitutional convention (which has never been done, but would have to be called for by 34 states). Either method is vanishingly unlikely because each would require many small states to approve a change that would reduce their influence on the presidential outcome.</p>\n<p>There is one potential workaround, however: the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a clever proposal that uses the Constitution&rsquo;s ambiguity on electors to its own ends.</p>\n<p>A state signing on to the compact agrees that it will pledge all its electors not to its state winner but to the victor in the national popular vote &mdash; but only if states controlling 270 or more electoral votes have agreed to do the same. If they do, and everything works as planned, then whoever wins the popular vote will necessarily win the electoral vote too.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting proposal that&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/written-explanation\">already been enacted into law by 12 states</a> (including the large states of California and New York) and the District of Columbia, which together control 181 electoral votes. But there&rsquo;s one big obstacle: Most of the states that have adopted it are solidly Democratic, and just one is a swing state.</p>\n<p>So unless a bunch of swing states decides to reduce their own power or Republican politicians conclude that a system bringing the power of small and rural states in line with that of big urban centers is a good idea, the compact isn&rsquo;t going to get the support it needs, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-a-plan-to-circumvent-the-electoral-college-is-probably-doomed/\">as FiveThirtyEight&rsquo;s Nate Silver has written</a>.</p>\n<p>At the very least, 2020 candidates&rsquo; focus on the issue is drawing attention to the possibility.</p>",

It\u2019s an arrangement that\u2019s raised more questions after candidates in recent elections (Hillary Clinton and Al Gore) won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.\nDefenders of the system argue that removing it would give populous urban centers disproportionate power to decide elections compared to more rural areas, while proponents note that it would simply give each vote the same weight.\nSure, the Electoral College is unpopular with Democrats, but how would you actually get rid of it?\nTo ditch the Electoral College entirely, the US would have to pass a constitutional amendment (passed by two-thirds of the House and Senate and approved by 38 states) \u2014 or convene a constitutional convention (which has never been done, but would have to be called for by 34 states). Either method is vanishingly unlikely because each would require many small states to approve a change that would reduce their influence on the presidential outcome.\nThere is one potential workaround, however: the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, a clever proposal that uses the Constitution\u2019s ambiguity on electors to its own ends.\nA state signing on to the compact agrees that it will pledge all its electors not to its state winner but to the victor in the national popular vote \u2014 but only if states controlling 270 or more electoral votes have agreed to do the same. If they do, and everything works as planned, then whoever wins the popular vote will necessarily win the electoral vote too.\nIt\u2019s an interesting proposal that\u2019s already been enacted into law by 12 states (including the large states of California and New York) and the District of Columbia, which together control 181 electoral votes. But there\u2019s one big obstacle: Most of the states that have adopted it are solidly Democratic, and just one is a swing state.\nSo unless a bunch of swing states decides to reduce their own power or Republican politicians conclude that a system bringing the power of small and rural states in line with that of big urban centers is a good idea, the compact isn\u2019t going to get the support it needs, as FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver has written.\nAt the very least, 2020 candidates\u2019 focus on the issue is drawing attention to the possibility.",

They can do this even to green card holders, and even if the convictions were fairly minor and the immigrant completed the sentences (or paid the fines) years ago.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s what the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in the case <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/16-1363_a86c.pdf\"><em>Preap v. Nielsen</em></a>. In a 5-4 ruling along ideological lines, the Court&rsquo;s conservative majority overruled a Ninth Circuit ruling that tried to limit which immigrants would be subject to mandatory detention without bond &mdash; something that a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11515132/iirira-clinton-immigration\">1996 immigration law</a> requires for immigrants with certain criminal histories or suspected terrorist ties.</p>\n<p>The court&rsquo;s decision doesn&rsquo;t create any new powers for ICE. In most of the country, immigrants were already ineligible for bond hearings if they were picked up for long-ago crimes, and often they were consigned to months of detention as they languished in a historically large court backlog. It just ends a brief period in which the West Coast, home of the Ninth Circuit, was the exception to that rule.</p>\n<p>Instead, the ruling is noteworthy mostly because of the court fight it sets up down the road.</p>\n<p>The court&rsquo;s liberals appear increasingly worried that the mandatory-detention law itself is unconstitutional. &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; wrote Justice Stephen Breyer in a dissent for the Court&rsquo;s four liberals, that Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling &ldquo;will work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood&rdquo; &mdash; principles that say that, as a rule, the government can&rsquo;t detain anyone indefinitely without showing cause and that people who have served criminal sentences can&rsquo;t be summarily reimprisoned for the same crime.</p>\n<p>Those principles don&rsquo;t hold in quite the same way when it comes to the immigration system &mdash; even though detention and deportation may seem as harsh as criminal punishments, they&rsquo;re technically part of a civil system that doesn&rsquo;t give the same protections to defendants. But as immigration enforcement has swelled in the 21st century, that&rsquo;s started to seem to some like cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<p>Even the conservative majority didn&rsquo;t argue that mandatory detention as it exists is constitutional. Instead, it all but invited a challenge to the constitutionality of the law &mdash; even while using that law&rsquo;s grammar to justify a policy that could result in detention of thousands more immigrants in the meantime.</p>\n<h3>Mandatory detention without bond is legal. The question is whether it applies years after the crime.</h3>\n<p>The 1996 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11515132/iirira-clinton-immigration\">Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA)</a> lays out certain categories of immigrants who are supposed to be picked up by federal immigration agents &ldquo;when they are released&rdquo; from criminal custody. (The categories are theoretically based on committing particularly serious or offensive crimes or having terrorist ties, but in practice, some of the grounds are so elastic that an immigrant won&rsquo;t even know whether he qualifies just based on his criminal conviction.) Those immigrants then have to be detained.</p>\n<p>In a decision last year, the Supreme Court held that those immigrants were not allowed to demand bond hearings &mdash; they had to be detained until their cases were resolved, no matter how long that took. The decision Tuesday examined whether that was also true of immigrants who were detained by immigration agents long after they were released from criminal custody, The lead plaintiff in the case, Mony Preap, was a green-card holder who was picked up by ICE seven years after serving sentences for two minor drug convictions, then detained for months as ICE sought to strip him of his green card and deport him.</p>\n<p>Legally, the Court&rsquo;s decision was a question of grammar: If the government was supposed to pick up mandatory detainees &ldquo;when they are released,&rdquo; but did not, would they still count as mandatory detainees? The conservative majority said yes, they would.</p>\n<p>Just as they did in the 2018 mandatory-detention ruling, the conservatives made a point of saying they weren&rsquo;t considering whether or not the statute was constitutional because that wasn&rsquo;t directly being challenged in this case.</p>\n<p>The implication is that at least some of the Court&rsquo;s conservatives might believe that Congress gave the federal government unconstitutional amounts of power in 1996, but they&rsquo;re not going to cross that bridge until they get to it.</p>\n<h3>Immigration detention has metastasized &mdash; and liberals are beginning to question its underpinnings</h3>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Justice Breyer&rsquo;s dissent for the liberals pointed out the real-world consequences of the grammar dispute: thousands of people with roots in the US might be whisked away by ICE for months or years with no court hearing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s view, the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community. These aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes&mdash;for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of &ldquo;moral turpitude&rdquo; such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person. </p></blockquote>\n<p>When the 1996 law was passed, there wasn&rsquo;t yet an agency tasked solely with the arrest and deportation of immigrants in the US &mdash; that agency, ICE, wasn&rsquo;t created until after 9/11. The amount of money currently spent on arrests, detention, and deportation of immigrants was hardly conceivable then.</p>\n<p>As immigration enforcement has ramped up generally, immigrants with old criminal convictions &mdash; including legal immigrants, even green card holders &mdash; have become especially appealing targets. Under Obama, immigrants with criminal records were targeted for deportation. Even though ICE isn&rsquo;t as limited in who it can arrest now, it&rsquo;s still constrained by how quickly it can track down and arrest people &mdash; and unlike immigrants who have stayed under the radar, ICE can use government databases to pick out people with criminal records who are potential deportees.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any incentive for ICE not to arrest someone because they couldn&rsquo;t afford to detain the person. Under Trump, ICE is detaining more people than it ever has before &mdash; and more than Congress has funded them for &mdash; and simply finding money in other places (either congressional supplements or other agency&rsquo;s budgets) to pay for it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the backlog in immigration courts means that waits for a hearing, even for detained immigrants, can take a much longer time than they did in 1996. The current backlog is more than 800,000 cases; it&rsquo;s jumped by 300,000 cases since the start of the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>The irony is that about 40 percent of the immigrants subject to mandatory detention end up winning their cases and being allowed to stay in the country. But after years or months in detention, it&rsquo;s possible that some immigrants who would be allowed to stay end up giving up the fight and accepting deportation, rather than continuing to go without income or freedom.</p>\n<p>To the Supreme Court&rsquo;s liberals, the real world impacts are impossible to ignore &mdash; they add up to a situation that the Court cannot allow to stand, as Breyer wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>we cannot interpret the words of this specific statute without also considering basic promises that America&rsquo;s legal system has long made to all persons. In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide&mdash;in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity&mdash;whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail. </p></blockquote>\n<p>In general, Breyer points out, the Court errs on the side of interpreting a law in a way that would make the law constitutional.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s liberals think that Tuesday&rsquo;s ruling did the opposite: It said that the law required a policy that seems obviously unconstitutional to them. The Court&rsquo;s conservatives aren&rsquo;t rebutting that possibility &mdash; they&rsquo;re just saying that they need a case that is explicitly about constitutionality to determine whether mandatory detention without bond is constitutional or not.</p>\n<p>That case, if it comes, will take years to get to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, a lot of immigrants could be detained without bond under a provision that almost half the Court thinks is unconstitutional and that a majority of it very well might.</p>",

                "text": "Alex Wong/Getty Images\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents have the power to arrest people who aren\u2019t US citizens and detain them for months or years, based on past convictions, with no chance of release on bond. They can do this even to green card holders, and even if the convictions were fairly minor and the immigrant completed the sentences (or paid the fines) years ago.\nThat\u2019s what the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in the case Preap v. Nielsen. In a 5-4 ruling along ideological lines, the Court\u2019s conservative majority overruled a Ninth Circuit ruling that tried to limit which immigrants would be subject to mandatory detention without bond \u2014 something that a 1996 immigration law requires for immigrants with certain criminal histories or suspected terrorist ties.\nThe court\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t create any new powers for ICE. In most of the country, immigrants were already ineligible for bond hearings if they were picked up for long-ago crimes, and often they were consigned to months of detention as they languished in a historically large court backlog. It just ends a brief period in which the West Coast, home of the Ninth Circuit, was the exception to that rule.\nInstead, the ruling is noteworthy mostly because of the court fight it sets up down the road.\nThe court\u2019s liberals appear increasingly worried that the mandatory-detention law itself is unconstitutional. \u201cI fear,\u201d wrote Justice Stephen Breyer in a dissent for the Court\u2019s four liberals, that Tuesday\u2019s ruling \u201cwill work serious harm to the principles for which American law has long stood\u201d \u2014 principles that say that, as a rule, the government can\u2019t detain anyone indefinitely without showing cause and that people who have served criminal sentences can\u2019t be summarily reimprisoned for the same crime.\nThose principles don\u2019t hold in quite the same way when it comes to the immigration system \u2014 even though detention and deportation may seem as harsh as criminal punishments, they\u2019re technically part of a civil system that doesn\u2019t give the same protections to defendants. But as immigration enforcement has swelled in the 21st century, that\u2019s started to seem to some like cognitive dissonance.\nEven the conservative majority didn\u2019t argue that mandatory detention as it exists is constitutional. Instead, it all but invited a challenge to the constitutionality of the law \u2014 even while using that law\u2019s grammar to justify a policy that could result in detention of thousands more immigrants in the meantime.\nMandatory detention without bond is legal. The question is whether it applies years after the crime.\nThe 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) lays out certain categories of immigrants who are supposed to be picked up by federal immigration agents \u201cwhen they are released\u201d from criminal custody. (The categories are theoretically based on committing particularly serious or offensive crimes or having terrorist ties, but in practice, some of the grounds are so elastic that an immigrant won\u2019t even know whether he qualifies just based on his criminal conviction.) Those immigrants then have to be detained.\nIn a decision last year, the Supreme Court held that those immigrants were not allowed to demand bond hearings \u2014 they had to be detained until their cases were resolved, no matter how long that took. The decision Tuesday examined whether that was also true of immigrants who were detained by immigration agents long after they were released from criminal custody, The lead plaintiff in the case, Mony Preap, was a green-card holder who was picked up by ICE seven years after serving sentences for two minor drug convictions, then detained for months as ICE sought to strip him of his green card and deport him.\nLegally, the Court\u2019s decision was a question of grammar: If the government was supposed to pick up mandatory detainees \u201cwhen they are released,\u201d but did not, would they still count as mandatory detainees? The conservative majority said yes, they would.\nJust as they did in the 2018 mandatory-detention ruling, the conservatives made a point of saying they weren\u2019t considering whether or not the statute was constitutional because that wasn\u2019t directly being challenged in this case.\nThe implication is that at least some of the Court\u2019s conservatives might believe that Congress gave the federal government unconstitutional amounts of power in 1996, but they\u2019re not going to cross that bridge until they get to it.\nImmigration detention has metastasized \u2014 and liberals are beginning to question its underpinnings\nUnsurprisingly, Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent for the liberals pointed out the real-world consequences of the grammar dispute: thousands of people with roots in the US might be whisked away by ICE for months or years with no court hearing.\nUnder the Government\u2019s view, the aliens subject to detention without a bail hearing may have been released from criminal custody years earlier, and may have established families and put down roots in a community. These aliens may then be detained for months, sometimes years, without the possibility of release; they may have been convicted of only minor crimes\u2014for example, minor drug offenses, or crimes of \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d such as illegally downloading music or possessing stolen bus transfers; and they sometimes may be innocent spouses or children of a suspect person.\nWhen the 1996 law was passed, there wasn\u2019t yet an agency tasked solely with the arrest and deportation of immigrants in the US \u2014 that agency, ICE, wasn\u2019t created until after 9/11. The amount of money currently spent on arrests, detention, and deportation of immigrants was hardly conceivable then.\nAs immigration enforcement has ramped up generally, immigrants with old criminal convictions \u2014 including legal immigrants, even green card holders \u2014 have become especially appealing targets. Under Obama, immigrants with criminal records were targeted for deportation. Even though ICE isn\u2019t as limited in who it can arrest now, it\u2019s still constrained by how quickly it can track down and arrest people \u2014 and unlike immigrants who have stayed under the radar, ICE can use government databases to pick out people with criminal records who are potential deportees.\nNor is there any incentive for ICE not to arrest someone because they couldn\u2019t afford to detain the person. Under Trump, ICE is detaining more people than it ever has before \u2014 and more than Congress has funded them for \u2014 and simply finding money in other places (either congressional supplements or other agency\u2019s budgets) to pay for it.\nMeanwhile, the backlog in immigration courts means that waits for a hearing, even for detained immigrants, can take a much longer time than they did in 1996. The current backlog is more than 800,000 cases; it\u2019s jumped by 300,000 cases since the start of the Trump administration.\nThe irony is that about 40 percent of the immigrants subject to mandatory detention end up winning their cases and being allowed to stay in the country. But after years or months in detention, it\u2019s possible that some immigrants who would be allowed to stay end up giving up the fight and accepting deportation, rather than continuing to go without income or freedom.\nTo the Supreme Court\u2019s liberals, the real world impacts are impossible to ignore \u2014 they add up to a situation that the Court cannot allow to stand, as Breyer wrote:\nwe cannot interpret the words of this specific statute without also considering basic promises that America\u2019s legal system has long made to all persons. In deciphering the intent of the Congress that wrote this statute, we must decide\u2014in the face of what is, at worst, linguistic ambiguity\u2014whether Congress intended that persons who have long since paid their debt to society would be deprived of their liberty for months or years without the possibility of bail.\nIn general, Breyer points out, the Court errs on the side of interpreting a law in a way that would make the law constitutional.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s liberals think that Tuesday\u2019s ruling did the opposite: It said that the law required a policy that seems obviously unconstitutional to them. The Court\u2019s conservatives aren\u2019t rebutting that possibility \u2014 they\u2019re just saying that they need a case that is explicitly about constitutionality to determine whether mandatory detention without bond is constitutional or not.\nThat case, if it comes, will take years to get to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, a lot of immigrants could be detained without bond under a provision that almost half the Court thinks is unconstitutional and that a majority of it very well might.",

also known as magic mushrooms.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Denver,_Colorado,_Initiated_Ordinance_301,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Initiative_(May_2019)\">Initiative 301</a> would designate &ldquo;the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms&rdquo; among people 21 and older as Denver&rsquo;s lowest possible law enforcement priority, and prohibit the city from spending resources to pursue criminal penalties related to the use or possession of psilocybin mushrooms among people 21 and older.</p>\n<p>It would also &ldquo;establish the psilocybin mushroom policy review panel to assess and report on the effects of the ordinance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The initiative would not legalize magic mushrooms; they&rsquo;d remain illegal under state and federal law. And it wouldn&rsquo;t decriminalize or deprioritize the distribution and sales of psilocybin mushrooms &mdash; all of that could still be pursued by police.</p>\n<p>Ballots containing the initiative were sent out Monday, <a href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/the-first-vote-to-decriminalize-psychedelic-mushrooms-is-happening-right-now/\">Kyle Jaeger reported for Marijuana Moment</a>.</p>\n<p>Advocates for the measure argue that decriminalization would shift law enforcement resources away from pursuing nonviolent offenses. They claim that psilocybin is safe, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/25/8104917/drug-dangers-marijuana-alcohol\">nonaddictive or close to nonaddictive</a>, and that a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11544250/psychedelic-drugs-lsd-psilocybin-effects\">growing body of evidence</a> suggests the drug has therapeutic benefits for illnesses ranging from depression to end-of-life anxiety to addiction.</p>\n<p>Opponents worry that decriminalization could lead to more drug use. Especially in Denver, they&rsquo;re concerned that decriminalization could perpetuate the city&rsquo;s reputation as &ldquo;a drug-friendly city,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2019/04/12/psilocybin-magic-mushrooms-decriminalization-denver-301/\">Jackson Barnett reported for the Denver Post</a>. Critics also point out psilocybin does have some risks &mdash; particularly, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11544250/psychedelic-drugs-lsd-psilocybin-effects#item6\">experts say</a>, the possibility of accidents and traumatic experiences that can be psychologically damaging (especially among people predisposed to mental illness).</p>\n<p>One potential source of real-world evidence here: Portugal. After the country decriminalized all drugs, it saw a decrease in drug-related deaths and drops in reported past-year and past-month drug use, according to a 2014 <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/success-portugal%E2%80%99s-decriminalisation-policy-%E2%80%93-seven-charts\">report</a> from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. But it also saw an increase in lifetime prevalence of drug use, as well as an uptick in reported use among teens after 2007.</p>\n<p>But Portugal also simultaneously adopted special commissions that attempt to link people with drug addictions to treatment. Although the success of the commissions has yet to be thoroughly evaluated, it&rsquo;s possible that even as decriminalization increased drug use, the commissions and more access to treatment got so many people off drugs that drug use still fell overall.</p>\n<p>Still, decriminalization alone may have its benefits. A 2009 <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies\">report</a> from the libertarian Cato Institute, written by Glenn Greenwald, concluded that decriminalization freed people from the &ldquo;fear of arrest&rdquo; when they sought help for their addiction and &ldquo;freed up resources that could be channeled into treatment and other harm reduction programs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What effects psilocybin decriminalization would have in the US, Colorado, or Denver, however, remains to be seen. Even more so than <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/20/17938332/marijuana-legalization-cannabis-weed-pot\">marijuana legalization</a>, this is an area of policy that&rsquo;s largely untested in modern America.</p>\n<p>This kind of pioneering vote isn&rsquo;t new for Denver or Colorado as a whole. In 2012, Colorado and Washington state became the first two states to legalize marijuana for recreational use.</p>\n<p>Other places, particularly <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2018/12/03/oregon-vote-2020-ballot-initiative-legalize-psychedelic-mushrooms-therapy/\">Oregon</a>, are considering measures to change their laws regarding psilocybin as well.</p>\n<p>But in Denver, voters will make the final choice on their own ballot initiative by the end of May 7 &mdash; and could make their city the first to decriminalize magic mushrooms.</p>",

                "text": "Photofusion/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\nDenver is now voting on whether it should become the first US city to effectively decriminalize mushrooms containing the psychedelic psilocybin \u2014 also known as magic mushrooms.\nInitiative 301 would designate \u201cthe personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms\u201d among people 21 and older as Denver\u2019s lowest possible law enforcement priority, and prohibit the city from spending resources to pursue criminal penalties related to the use or possession of psilocybin mushrooms among people 21 and older.\nIt would also \u201cestablish the psilocybin mushroom policy review panel to assess and report on the effects of the ordinance.\u201d\nThe initiative would not legalize magic mushrooms; they\u2019d remain illegal under state and federal law. And it wouldn\u2019t decriminalize or deprioritize the distribution and sales of psilocybin mushrooms \u2014 all of that could still be pursued by police.\nBallots containing the initiative were sent out Monday, Kyle Jaeger reported for Marijuana Moment.\nAdvocates for the measure argue that decriminalization would shift law enforcement resources away from pursuing nonviolent offenses. They claim that psilocybin is safe, nonaddictive or close to nonaddictive, and that a growing body of evidence suggests the drug has therapeutic benefits for illnesses ranging from depression to end-of-life anxiety to addiction.\nOpponents worry that decriminalization could lead to more drug use. Especially in Denver, they\u2019re concerned that decriminalization could perpetuate the city\u2019s reputation as \u201ca drug-friendly city,\u201d Jackson Barnett reported for the Denver Post. Critics also point out psilocybin does have some risks \u2014 particularly, experts say, the possibility of accidents and traumatic experiences that can be psychologically damaging (especially among people predisposed to mental illness).\nOne potential source of real-world evidence here: Portugal. After the country decriminalized all drugs, it saw a decrease in drug-related deaths and drops in reported past-year and past-month drug use, according to a 2014 report from the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. But it also saw an increase in lifetime prevalence of drug use, as well as an uptick in reported use among teens after 2007.\nBut Portugal also simultaneously adopted special commissions that attempt to link people with drug addictions to treatment. Although the success of the commissions has yet to be thoroughly evaluated, it\u2019s possible that even as decriminalization increased drug use, the commissions and more access to treatment got so many people off drugs that drug use still fell overall.\nStill, decriminalization alone may have its benefits. A 2009 report from the libertarian Cato Institute, written by Glenn Greenwald, concluded that decriminalization freed people from the \u201cfear of arrest\u201d when they sought help for their addiction and \u201cfreed up resources that could be channeled into treatment and other harm reduction programs.\u201d\nWhat effects psilocybin decriminalization would have in the US, Colorado, or Denver, however, remains to be seen. Even more so than marijuana legalization, this is an area of policy that\u2019s largely untested in modern America.\nThis kind of pioneering vote isn\u2019t new for Denver or Colorado as a whole. In 2012, Colorado and Washington state became the first two states to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\nOther places, particularly Oregon, are considering measures to change their laws regarding psilocybin as well.\nBut in Denver, voters will make the final choice on their own ballot initiative by the end of May 7 \u2014 and could make their city the first to decriminalize magic mushrooms.",

After brain cells die, they are thought to be impossible to revive.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-019-1099-1&referrer=vox.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fscience-and-health%2F2019%2F4%2F17%2F18410611%2Fpig-brain-nature-study-revive-cell-death-brainex\">a stunning new finding</a> published Wednesday in the journal <em>Nature </em>turns that conventional wisdom around.</p>\n<p>In a paper that reads a bit like an adaptation of Mary Shelley, researchers at Yale University describe how they were able to partially revive disembodied pigs&rsquo; brains several hours after the pigs&rsquo; death.</p>\n<p>First, the researchers took 32 brains from pigs slaughtered for food and waited four hours. Then they hooked them up for six hours to a system called BrainEx, which pumped those brains full of oxygen, nutrients, and protective chemicals.</p>\n<p>At the end of the 10 hours, the scientists found that the tissue of the pig brains was largely intact, compared to controls. Individual brain cells were up and running, performing their basic duties of taking up oxygen and producing carbon dioxide.</p>\n<p>To be clear: The neurons in these brains were not communicating, so there was no consciousness. But the cells were alive &mdash; and that alone is a very big discovery.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Previously, findings have shown that in basically minutes, the cells undergo a process of cell death,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/sestan/\">Nenad Sestan</a>, the Yale neuroscientist who led the effort, said during a press conference. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re showing is that the process of cell death is a gradual step-wise process, and some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved, or even reversed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The implications are bigger than just basic science research. The ethics of experimenting on partially reanimated brains is uncharted territory.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My first reaction was holy shit,&rdquo; says Hank Greely, a Stanford law and ethics professor who reviewed the findings and co-authored a commentary on the paper in <em>Nature</em>. &ldquo;The conventional wisdom is brain cells die, irretrievably, after about 10 to 12 minutes without oxygen &mdash; and that&rsquo;s part of the scientific underpinning for the definition of brain death, the definition of death in humans. The idea [that] after four hours with no oxygen, or glucose, or anything else, most of the cells in the pig&rsquo;s brain would start functioning again? That&rsquo;s astounding.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s so astounding, he says, that perhaps we should reconsider the definition of death. And we should definitely consider the unexplored ethical implications of partially reviving a dead animal. Because, what if, even for a moment, that pig brain felt something?</p>\n<h3>Wait, why were researchers doing this in the first place? </h3>\n<p>So this research is astounding, if a bit creepy. But what&rsquo;s the point of all of it?</p>\n<p>The BrainEx system comes out of the National Institutes of Health&rsquo;s BRAIN initiative (a.k.a. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies). This was President Barack Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;moonshot&rdquo; project to map the human brain and to create new tools to study it.</p>\n<p>BrainEx is one of those tools, developed in consult with the neuroethics working group at the NIH. Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, the team lead of the BRAIN Initiative at the NIH, says BrainEx &ldquo;is really a tool to study basic biology,&rdquo; to study the three-dimensional structure of a living brain outside the confines of the body.</p>\n<p>In the past, scientists have been able to culture slices of brains and other tissues from dead animals in a petri dish environment. But never before have they had the chance to study those complex relationships with an entire brain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A whole cellularly active organ allows you to study the interrelationship between the parts of the brain,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://law.duke.edu/fac/farahany/\">Nita Farahany</a>, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke who consulted on the ethics of the study. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get that with just slices of tissue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The scientists hope these whole, preserved, somewhat alive brains will also be useful for neuroscience research, allowing others to test drugs and study disease pathways and neuroanatomy. It also raises the far-flung possibility of helping people revive brains damaged due to stroke or other injury. Sestan, the lead researcher on the effort, says he&rsquo;s not sure if that&rsquo;s even possible.</p>\n<p>But if it is, in the much, much longer term, it could force us to reconsider the definition of death itself.</p>\n<h3>How the BrainEx system works</h3>\n<p>Four hours after the pigs were slaughtered in a meat processing plant, researchers hooked up the brains to BrainEx to try to restore and preserve the cellular function of the brains after death. As the researchers stressed many times during a press call, the BrainEx does not have the ability to &ldquo;reanimate&rdquo; an entire brain. &ldquo;That was not the goal,&rdquo; Sestan says. The goal was to test if individual brain cells could be revived in this manner.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it worked. (You might have heard of this process before: Last year, the MIT Technology Review reported on this work <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611007/researchers-are-keeping-pig-brains-alive-outside-the-body/\">while it was still preliminary</a> and unpublished.)</p>\n<p>Four hours after slaughter, the pig brains were attached to the BrainEx device via the carotid arteries. You can think of the device as something like an artificial heart. It pumps a perfusate &mdash; a synthetic blood that delivers oxygen and nutrients &mdash; throughout the brain via the pig&rsquo;s own arteries.</p>\n<figure><picture data-cdata=\"{\" data-cid=\"site/picture_element-1581009424_4379_57696\"> <source sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbdN367NbMc2yfZMEATehBLsuy8=/0x0:493x400/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S72Um39WBNtFHg-8aCg-RZ31vog=/0x0:493x400/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6QMJQr0m_la1ZjwiagYUgZAfoGQ=/0x0:493x400/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M4LbBeXwQXWZGeGQnrslz59TDgc=/0x0:493x400/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aLyyPMT3NhepyClEgt3JBfy__hQ=/0x0:493x400/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZgZIm8AvwSkoroHyjxQ8_88oAXg=/0x0:493x400/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2t3gzmpi30H1rmQrWUZPYHNsZAI=/0x0:493x400/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYAhcjunUc-sgoVBzGymOia6_38=/0x0:493x400/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLrmHpoBwheb8XhE8IueCqVEJzg=/0x0:493x400/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1920w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source> <img alt=\"\" data-upload-width=\"493\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1221px) 846px, (min-width: 880px) calc(100vw - 334px), 100vw\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAjPQWrKylI9MwELfaf680K3cEU=/0x0:493x400/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwFANhPzBuCu5K0ZD5--IUz1dTQ=/0x0:493x400/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kONXZ5IONbMs3kkEvCat764n1bs=/0x0:493x400/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rFJkRSshyktl_z7mtNC-tnvra34=/0x0:493x400/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVQXzXBTXjw6a7VEkWpydPqdB10=/0x0:493x400/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 920w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puh3iYZOIHgfouKaFJuJJeEio5M=/0x0:493x400/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1120w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgjXoWa2QczcyC7ggIyP4yIQf0I=/0x0:493x400/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1320w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSsLMSIJi6055QPwZIV-imctpFs=/0x0:493x400/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1520w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4vB_YhulHlDVDGaqfjQJxGEPEk=/0x0:493x400/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1720w, https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xgd8hDo5fceCecoEbqVkyYb4-3g=/0x0:493x400/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:493x400):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16127668/Screen_Shot_2019_04_17_at_11.20.48_AM.png 1920w\"></img> </picture><figcaption>This is a diagram showing the various parts of the BrainEx device. It&rsquo;s complicated! </figcaption></figure>\n<p>The perfusate also contains chemicals that stop the oxidation (i.e., breakdown) of body tissue, that stop apoptosis (cells bursting after death). It also contains a neural activity blocker, the purpose of which is twofold.</p>\n<p>One was to halt excitotoxicity &mdash; a process by which neurons become damaged when they are left turned on, creating a chemical imbalance, also leading to cell death. The other was to make sure the brain didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; and regain any level of consciousness. If any consciousness was detected via EEG, the researchers said, they would have shut down the experiment immediately. They were even standing by with anesthesia to administer to the brain in case any widespread neural activity was detected.</p>\n<p>After six hours on the BrainEx &mdash; 10 hours after slaughter &mdash; the researchers didn&rsquo;t see signs of consciousness in the brains. But they did see signs of life.

On the left, an untreated brain 10 hours after death. The neurons are stained in green. &ldquo;Ten hours postmortem, neurons and astrocytes undergo cellular disintegration unless salvaged by the BrainEx system,&rdquo; the researchers find.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most compellingly: When the brains were dissected and the neural activity blocker was washed away, the researchers found the neurons retained their ability to communicate with one another. That means the cells retained the function they had when the body was alive.</p>\n<p>At the end of the six hours, the brains were taken off the BrainEx. By that point, the control brains were too damaged to continue. But the researchers say there&rsquo;s no reason the brains getting the perfusate couldn&rsquo;t be left on for longer.</p>\n<h3>What if you could restore consciousness in an animal&rsquo;s brain? </h3>\n<p>At no point during any of the trials, the researchers say, did the pigs&rsquo; brains regain consciousness, as measured by EEG (electroencephalogram), which records widespread electrical activity in the brain. Without widespread electrical activity, the brain is not believed to have any ability to think. &ldquo;This is a clinically dead brain,&rdquo; Sestan says.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s more nuanced than that. It&rsquo;s dead, but it&rsquo;s also somewhat alive. What Sestan and his team are claiming is they kept the individual cells of the brain alive, hours after the pig was killed. But those cells, for the most part, weren&rsquo;t talking to one another.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If consciousness were somehow induced in the brain,&rdquo; there was no ethics protocol in place, says Stephen Latham, a Yale researcher who served as the team&rsquo;s bioethicist. &ldquo;If consciousness was induced by the research, the research would have to stop until we could pull together some kind of ethics and neuro expertise to give guidance to the future conduct of the research.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the same time, it&rsquo;s hard to know if EEG is the only indicator of consciousness or perception of any kind. There are billions of neurons in a pig&rsquo;s brain. How many need to be activated for a pig to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; anything &mdash; as much as a disembodied pig brain could feel or interpret anything &mdash; is not known.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re right, that given the lack of an EEG, it would be shocking if there were any consciousness there,&rdquo; Greely says. &ldquo;But are there parts of the pig brain that are somehow sensing and reacting to pain? &hellip; [I]s that something to worry about? The lack of an EEG is very comforting, but what comes next? Will there always be the lack of an EEG? ... My honest answer to the question of &lsquo;does this make the possibility of reanimation thinkable?&rsquo; is &lsquo;maybe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Scientists are heading into uncharted territory</h3>\n<p>All of this is so new. There are some other immediate ethical considerations to think through as the science progresses.</p>\n<p>One is how should scientists think about the ethics of experimenting on partially revived animals?</p>\n<p>Technically, this doesn&rsquo;t fall into the category of animal research &ldquo;because the brain comes to the researchers already from a dead animal,&rdquo; from a slaughterhouse, Latham explains.

                "text": "David McNew/Getty Images\nAround 15 minutes after a mammal\u2019s brain is cut off from oxygen, the organ is supposed to die.\nWithout life-giving oxygen, the cells of the brain quickly starve. Some of the cells burst open, while the chemistry of others becomes so imbalanced that their membranes break down. This frenzied spiral ends one way: in death.\nIt\u2019s thought that this process is widespread across brain anatomy and irreversible. After brain cells die, they are thought to be impossible to revive.\nBut a stunning new finding published Wednesday in the journal Nature turns that conventional wisdom around.\nIn a paper that reads a bit like an adaptation of Mary Shelley, researchers at Yale University describe how they were able to partially revive disembodied pigs\u2019 brains several hours after the pigs\u2019 death.\nFirst, the researchers took 32 brains from pigs slaughtered for food and waited four hours. Then they hooked them up for six hours to a system called BrainEx, which pumped those brains full of oxygen, nutrients, and protective chemicals.\nAt the end of the 10 hours, the scientists found that the tissue of the pig brains was largely intact, compared to controls. Individual brain cells were up and running, performing their basic duties of taking up oxygen and producing carbon dioxide.\nTo be clear: The neurons in these brains were not communicating, so there was no consciousness. But the cells were alive \u2014 and that alone is a very big discovery.\n\u201cPreviously, findings have shown that in basically minutes, the cells undergo a process of cell death,\u201d Nenad Sestan, the Yale neuroscientist who led the effort, said during a press conference. \u201cWhat we\u2019re showing is that the process of cell death is a gradual step-wise process, and some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved, or even reversed.\u201d\nThe implications are bigger than just basic science research. The ethics of experimenting on partially reanimated brains is uncharted territory.\n\u201cMy first reaction was holy shit,\u201d says Hank Greely, a Stanford law and ethics professor who reviewed the findings and co-authored a commentary on the paper in Nature. \u201cThe conventional wisdom is brain cells die, irretrievably, after about 10 to 12 minutes without oxygen \u2014 and that\u2019s part of the scientific underpinning for the definition of brain death, the definition of death in humans. The idea [that] after four hours with no oxygen, or glucose, or anything else, most of the cells in the pig\u2019s brain would start functioning again? That\u2019s astounding.\u201d\nIt\u2019s so astounding, he says, that perhaps we should reconsider the definition of death. And we should definitely consider the unexplored ethical implications of partially reviving a dead animal. Because, what if, even for a moment, that pig brain felt something?\nWait, why were researchers doing this in the first place?\nSo this research is astounding, if a bit creepy. But what\u2019s the point of all of it?\nThe BrainEx system comes out of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s BRAIN initiative (a.k.a. Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies). This was President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d project to map the human brain and to create new tools to study it.\nBrainEx is one of those tools, developed in consult with the neuroethics working group at the NIH. Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, the team lead of the BRAIN Initiative at the NIH, says BrainEx \u201cis really a tool to study basic biology,\u201d to study the three-dimensional structure of a living brain outside the confines of the body.\nIn the past, scientists have been able to culture slices of brains and other tissues from dead animals in a petri dish environment. But never before have they had the chance to study those complex relationships with an entire brain.\n\u201cA whole cellularly active organ allows you to study the interrelationship between the parts of the brain,\u201d says Nita Farahany, a professor of law and philosophy at Duke who consulted on the ethics of the study. \u201cYou can\u2019t get that with just slices of tissue.\u201d\nThe scientists hope these whole, preserved, somewhat alive brains will also be useful for neuroscience research, allowing others to test drugs and study disease pathways and neuroanatomy. It also raises the far-flung possibility of helping people revive brains damaged due to stroke or other injury. Sestan, the lead researcher on the effort, says he\u2019s not sure if that\u2019s even possible.\nBut if it is, in the much, much longer term, it could force us to reconsider the definition of death itself.\nHow the BrainEx system works\nFour hours after the pigs were slaughtered in a meat processing plant, researchers hooked up the brains to BrainEx to try to restore and preserve the cellular function of the brains after death. As the researchers stressed many times during a press call, the BrainEx does not have the ability to \u201creanimate\u201d an entire brain. \u201cThat was not the goal,\u201d Sestan says. The goal was to test if individual brain cells could be revived in this manner.\nHere\u2019s how it worked. (You might have heard of this process before: Last year, the MIT Technology Review reported on this work while it was still preliminary and unpublished.)\nFour hours after slaughter, the pig brains were attached to the BrainEx device via the carotid arteries. You can think of the device as something like an artificial heart. It pumps a perfusate \u2014 a synthetic blood that delivers oxygen and nutrients \u2014 throughout the brain via the pig\u2019s own arteries.\nNature\nThe perfusate also contains chemicals that stop the oxidation (i.e., breakdown) of body tissue, that stop apoptosis (cells bursting after death). It also contains a neural activity blocker, the purpose of which is twofold.\nOne was to halt excitotoxicity \u2014 a process by which neurons become damaged when they are left turned on, creating a chemical imbalance, also leading to cell death. The other was to make sure the brain didn\u2019t \u201cwake up\u201d and regain any level of consciousness. If any consciousness was detected via EEG, the researchers said, they would have shut down the experiment immediately. They were even standing by with anesthesia to administer to the brain in case any widespread neural activity was detected.\nAfter six hours on the BrainEx \u2014 10 hours after slaughter \u2014 the researchers didn\u2019t see signs of consciousness in the brains. But they did see signs of life. When hooked up to the BrainEx system, \u201cwe see the brains extract oxygen ... they use glucose [sugar], and they produce CO2,\u201d Zvonimir Vrselja, a Yale researcher and one of the study co-authors, told reporters.\nWhich is to say: The cells\u2019 metabolism was turned on. That means they were, to some degree, alive.\nUnder the microscope, the cells of the BrainEx brains looked relatively normal, while the cells in the control brains, which were hooked up to the BrainEx but not to the sustaining perfusate, looked damaged.\nNature\nMost compellingly: When the brains were dissected and the neural activity blocker was washed away, the researchers found the neurons retained their ability to communicate with one another. That means the cells retained the function they had when the body was alive.\nAt the end of the six hours, the brains were taken off the BrainEx. By that point, the control brains were too damaged to continue. But the researchers say there\u2019s no reason the brains getting the perfusate couldn\u2019t be left on for longer.\nWhat if you could restore consciousness in an animal\u2019s brain?\nAt no point during any of the trials, the researchers say, did the pigs\u2019 brains regain consciousness, as measured by EEG (electroencephalogram), which records widespread electrical activity in the brain. Without widespread electrical activity, the brain is not believed to have any ability to think. \u201cThis is a clinically dead brain,\u201d Sestan says.\nBut it\u2019s more nuanced than that. It\u2019s dead, but it\u2019s also somewhat alive. What Sestan and his team are claiming is they kept the individual cells of the brain alive, hours after the pig was killed. But those cells, for the most part, weren\u2019t talking to one another.\n\u201cIf consciousness were somehow induced in the brain,\u201d there was no ethics protocol in place, says Stephen Latham, a Yale researcher who served as the team\u2019s bioethicist. \u201cIf consciousness was induced by the research, the research would have to stop until we could pull together some kind of ethics and neuro expertise to give guidance to the future conduct of the research.\u201d\nAt the same time, it\u2019s hard to know if EEG is the only indicator of consciousness or perception of any kind. There are billions of neurons in a pig\u2019s brain. How many need to be activated for a pig to \u201cfeel\u201d anything \u2014 as much as a disembodied pig brain could feel or interpret anything \u2014 is not known.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re right, that given the lack of an EEG, it would be shocking if there were any consciousness there,\u201d Greely says. \u201cBut are there parts of the pig brain that are somehow sensing and reacting to pain? \u2026 [I]s that something to worry about? The lack of an EEG is very comforting, but what comes next? Will there always be the lack of an EEG? ... My honest answer to the question of \u2018does this make the possibility of reanimation thinkable?\u2019 is \u2018maybe.\u2019\u201d\nScientists are heading into uncharted territory\nAll of this is so new. There are some other immediate ethical considerations to think through as the science progresses.\nOne is how should scientists think about the ethics of experimenting on partially revived animals?\nTechnically, this doesn\u2019t fall into the category of animal research \u201cbecause the brain comes to the researchers already from a dead animal,\u201d from a slaughterhouse, Latham explains. That means the researchers don\u2019t have to follow the ethical guidelines that come with animal research, namely that animals should not be subjected to unnecessary harm. But what about partially revived animal brains? There\u2019s no guidance on that.\nHere\u2019s another. The researchers also used chemicals to block neural activity in the pigs\u2019 brains to try to ensure they never became conscious. But what if the researchers hadn\u2019t done this? They wouldn\u2019t speculate what would happen then. They don\u2019t know if some consciousness could ever be restored after death, and they say they don\u2019t want to try to restore it.\nBut some other research group might take their results and try. And there need to be ethical guidelines in place for that, the ethicists say. \u201cThere is, at least, the potential for EEG [brain activity] to be restored,\u201d Farahany says. \u201cAnd that means the capacity for pain and distress could be restored as well.\u201d\nGreely adds, \u201cWe have an obligation not to be cruel to this former pig.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Greely and Farahany suggest, the research can continue, but scientists need to keep safeguards \u2014 like the neural activity blockers and the anesthesia \u2014 in place in the case any consciousness is revived.\nIn a separate commentary in Nature, bioethicists Stuart Youngner and Insoo Hyun warn that the findings could have implications for organ donation. If it\u2019s conceivably possible to keep a brain alive for a period after death, should doctors feel more reluctant to harvest organs for donation?\n\u201cIf technologies similar to BrainEx are improved and developed for use in humans, people who are declared brain dead (especially those with brain injuries resulting from a lack of oxygen) could become candidates for brain resuscitation rather than organ donation,\u201d Youngner and Hyun write. \u201cCertainly, it could become harder for physicians or family members to be convinced that further medical intervention is futile.\u201d\nAgain, that\u2019s far off at this point. But these findings implore us to think a bit more deeply on this question: Where is the line between life and death? It\u2019s less clear than it was a day ago. \u201cWe had clear lines,\u201d Farahany says. \u201cThere was dead and there was alive. ... This calls that into question.\u201d\nWe need to see the study replicated, Farahany says. And there are a lot of unanswered questions about its potential use in other animals, or perhaps in humans. \u201cBut at least it opens up the possibility that what once was lost is possibly recoverable.\u201d",

to the deadline.</p>\n<p>This is by no means a guarantee that Britain&rsquo;s scheduled departure date &mdash; <a href=\"https://howmanydaystill.com/its/brexit-6\">a mere 31 days away</a> &mdash; will be delayed, and any deadline extension would ultimately require the EU&rsquo;s approval.</p>\n<p>But May&rsquo;s speech on Tuesday represents a major softening in her stance, and it was a substantial concession to the pro-Remain members of her Conservative Party &mdash; which <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/1092415/Brexit-news-Theresa-May-no-deal-EU-exit-Remain-ministers-rebellion-Brexiteers\">means it&rsquo;s infuriated the hardline Brexiteers</a> who are eager for a decisive break with the European Union.</p>\n<p>May&rsquo;s announcement also didn&rsquo;t address the fundamental conundrum of Brexit: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/11/27/18106619/brext-deal-theresa-may-parliament-european-union\">that the UK still has no idea</a> how to break up with the EU. Pushing back the Brexit deadline doesn&rsquo;t rule out a no-deal Brexit; it might just postpone it.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the latest developments.</p>\n<h3>May&rsquo;s brand-new Brexit plan</h3>\n<p>On Tuesday, May outlined the next steps for Parliament. They are, simply: another vote on a Brexit deal, and then a vote on what to do next.</p>\n<p>The prime minister had promised to come back to Parliament and allow it to cast another &ldquo;meaningful vote&rdquo; on a revised deal on March 12. This would be a reprise of the Brexit vote in January, where Parliament voted down May&rsquo;s Brexit plan <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/15/18175928/brexit-deal-vote-defeat-parliament-theresa-may\">by a historic 230-vote margin.</a></p>\n<p>If she can get this latest iteration of the deal through Parliament (and this is still a big if) then the story&rsquo;s over: The UK has a plan in place for exiting the EU.</p>\n<p>If for some reason this vote doesn&rsquo;t happen on that date or May&rsquo;s deal gets defeated once again, Parliament will get to vote the following day on whether it wants to leave the EU without a deal on March 29. This means the UK could <em>willingly</em> crash out of the EU without any transition plan.</p>\n<p>If that no-deal motion gets defeated, Parliament will get to vote a third time. This vote, which would take place on March 14, will be to decide whether the UK should seek a limited <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/15/18175928/brexit-deal-vote-defeat-parliament-theresa-may\">extension to Article 50</a>, the provision of the EU treaty under which the UK is withdrawing from the bloc.</p>\n<p>This short-term extension requires approval from the EU. It <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-officials/eu-could-grant-britain-short-brexit-delay-officials-idUSKCN1QF1O2\">seems possible the EU will go for that,</a> but it&rsquo;s not yet guaranteed.</p>\n<h3>How Parliament might respond to May&rsquo;s latest concession</h3>\n<p>The only sure thing about May&rsquo;s new Brexit timeline is that the second week of March is going to be ... eventful.</p>\n<p>Right now, May and members of her government are jetting off to Brussels to meet with EU leaders to try to wring some concessions on the current withdrawal agreement &mdash; the same one the UK <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/15/18175928/brexit-deal-vote-defeat-parliament-theresa-may\">Parliament</a> rejected in January.</p>\n<p>May is specifically trying to secure changes to the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/18/18204269/brexit-irish-border-backstop-explained\">&ldquo;Irish backstop,&rdquo;</a> a part of the withdrawal deal that will guarantee the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland remains open, no matter what the future EU-UK relationship looks like. (For more on this, and why it&rsquo;s so controversial, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/18/18204269/brexit-irish-border-backstop-explained\">read Vox&rsquo;s explainer.</a>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/europe/brexit-theresa-may-brussels.html\">These talks seem to be going nowhere</a>, which means that whatever May brings back to Parliament will look a lot like the same deal that everyone hated last month. But there&rsquo;s an outside chance that May&rsquo;s deal will pass in March, because it might end up being the least-bad option both for members of Parliament (MPs) who desperately want to divorce the EU and for those who want to remain.</p>\n<p>Remember, May is offering two votes if her deal fails: one on a no-deal Brexit and another on extending the Brexit deadline. Right now, the majority of MPs don&rsquo;t want a no-deal exit because it will likely be extraordinarily disruptive. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47379308\">There are legitimate questions</a> about <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-government-worried-businesses-residents-arent-ready-no-deal-brexit-173001700.html\">how prepared UK</a> businesses and residents are for this scenario with just a few weeks until March 29.</p>\n<p>But not everyone is enamored with the idea of extending the Brexit deadline, either. And the people who really hate this idea are the Brexiteers who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg/status/1100423194253627392\">are already freaking out</a> about the possibility of a delay and framing it as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Rees_Mogg/status/1100423194253627392\">&ldquo;plot&rdquo; to undo Brexit altogether.</a></p>\n<p>So Brexiteers &mdash; and others who support Brexit but don&rsquo;t want to see a no-deal scenario &mdash; may give in and choose May&rsquo;s deal to avoid what they see as a worse scenario: postponing the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU. And if pro-Remain MPs fear the possibility, even if its small, that Parliament somehow votes for a no-deal Brexit before it has a chance to extend the deadline, they might be convinced to back May&rsquo;s deal.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s still probably not enough to push May&rsquo;s deal over the edge; she still has to overcome a 230-point deficit. And now that May has put the option of delaying Brexit on the table, everyone who has a competing vision for a better Brexit outcome &mdash; a &ldquo;softer&rdquo; Brexit or a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/12/17/18141030/brexit-second-referendum-peoples-vote-uk-q-a\">second referendum</a> &mdash; might think that getting an extension is the best way to achieve it.</p>\n<h3>May&rsquo;s announcement probably does make a Brexit extension likely. But to what end, really?</h3>\n<p>May&rsquo;s decision on Tuesday represents a major shift in her position. She had previously stuck to the ultimatum: pass the Brexit deal, or leave without one altogether on March 29.</p>\n<p>Her about-face seems to have been an attempt to stave off a revolt from Remainers in her party, specifically <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/24/uk/brexit-theresa-may-sharm-el-sheikh-gbr-intl/index.html\">those in her Cabinet</a> who were seething that May hadn&rsquo;t ruled out a no-deal Brexit and threatened to resign.</p>\n<p>And on Wednesday, Parliament is expected to vote on a bunch of amendments that may potentially give MPs more control over Brexit. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47356265\">One proposed amendment,</a> brought forward by a Labour MP and a Conservative MP, would have delayed the Brexit deadline if May&rsquo;s deal failed in March. So May, it seems, calculated that rather than risking giving Parliament all the power, she would head them off.</p>\n<p>Parliament is extremely divided, but <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=may+doomed+mission+vox&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS769US769&oq=may+doomed+mission+vox&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.2981j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">the majority support avoiding a no-deal exit</a>. Even the UK&rsquo;s own government has said <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781768/Implications_for_Business_and_Trade_of_a_No_Deal_Exit_on_29_March_2019.pdf\">that many sectors of the economy</a> are unprepared for the massive disruptions and economic shock that would occur if this happened on March 29. So if May&rsquo;s deal fails again, it seems likely that extending the deadline would pass Parliament.</p>\n<p>The big question is: If Parliament approves a delay, what will it even accomplish?</p>\n<p>If the Brexit deadline is pushed back, the UK must still pass some sort of deal or come to a consensus on how to leave the EU. Extending the Brexit date does not eliminate the possibility of a no-deal Brexit &mdash; it just delays the disaster for a few more months.</p>\n<p>And the UK can&rsquo;t just decide on its own to delay. Even a short-term extension <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/26/698069910/may-offers-a-vote-on-delaying-brexit-expanding-options-as-eu-deadline-looms\">still requires EU approval.</a></p>\n<p>EU leaders have so far been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2019/1/15/18175928/brexit-deal-vote-defeat-parliament-theresa-may\">fairly reluctant</a> to grant the UK an extension unless there&rsquo;s a legitimate reason &mdash; something that could fundamentally change the Brexit outcome, such as another referendum vote on whether to leave the EU or new general elections.</p>\n<p>In other words, the EU doesn&rsquo;t really want to give the UK more time to argue about a Brexit deal they might have already voted down twice. But the EU <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-officials/eu-could-grant-britain-short-brexit-delay-officials-idUSKCN1QF1O2\">also wants to avoid the chaos</a> of a no-deal scenario, so it&rsquo;s possible they&rsquo;ll relent.</p>\n<p>There are complications here, too. Specifically, the European Parliamentary elections, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-parliament-election-could-upend-politics-across-europe/2019/02/24/226ed186-3808-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html?utm_term=.e3bcdcca337f\">which are taking place in May.</a> The newly elected EU Parliament takes over on July 1, so any delay longer than a few months would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-chief-uk-voting-in-european-election-would-be-a-joke/2019/02/19/e7db52a2-341e-11e9-8375-e3dcf6b68558_story.html?utm_term=.5e205902eb48\">mean the UK would have to participate in those elections</a>.</p>\n<p>The EU <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/24/brexit-could-be-delayed-until-2021-eu-sources-reveal\">has reportedly floated</a> the idea of offering the UK an extension until 2021, especially since it&rsquo;s uncertain what a short-term delay can accomplish. It would give the EU and UK time to reset and figure out their future relationship, but it also sounds like Brexiteer and Leave supporters&rsquo; worst nightmare.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the fact that many opponents of Brexit would seize on any length of extension to try to push through a new plan. This is where the elusive second referendum comes in, essentially a public vote on the future of Brexit. May remains opposed.</p>\n<p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/labour-brexit-backlash-expected-second-referendum\">indicated on Monday that he&rsquo;d be open to supporting a second referendum</a> if his Brexit plan fails in Parliament this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/25/what-does-labour-brexit-second-vote-referendum-commitment-mean\">which is almost guaranteed</a>. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/26/labour-brexit-backlash-expected-second-referendum\">Corbyn&rsquo;s shift is causing even more fractures within Labour</a>, and it&rsquo;s not yet clear a referendum would garner enough votes in Parliament.</p>\n<p>All of which is to say, a no-deal Brexit is looking a little less likely &mdash; at least on March 29.</p>",

                "text": "Leon Neal/Getty Images\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that she\u2019ll give Parliament a chance to delay Brexit.\nMay told lawmakers that if an upcoming second vote on her Brexit deal fails, they could vote to either leave the European Union without a deal on March 29 or seek a \u201cshort limited extension\u201d to the deadline.\nThis is by no means a guarantee that Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date \u2014 a mere 31 days away \u2014 will be delayed, and any deadline extension would ultimately require the EU\u2019s approval.\nBut May\u2019s speech on Tuesday represents a major softening in her stance, and it was a substantial concession to the pro-Remain members of her Conservative Party \u2014 which means it\u2019s infuriated the hardline Brexiteers who are eager for a decisive break with the European Union.\nMay\u2019s announcement also didn\u2019t address the fundamental conundrum of Brexit: that the UK still has no idea how to break up with the EU. Pushing back the Brexit deadline doesn\u2019t rule out a no-deal Brexit; it might just postpone it.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the latest developments.\nMay\u2019s brand-new Brexit plan\nOn Tuesday, May outlined the next steps for Parliament. They are, simply: another vote on a Brexit deal, and then a vote on what to do next.\nThe prime minister had promised to come back to Parliament and allow it to cast another \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d on a revised deal on March 12. This would be a reprise of the Brexit vote in January, where Parliament voted down May\u2019s Brexit plan by a historic 230-vote margin.\nIf she can get this latest iteration of the deal through Parliament (and this is still a big if) then the story\u2019s over: The UK has a plan in place for exiting the EU.\nIf for some reason this vote doesn\u2019t happen on that date or May\u2019s deal gets defeated once again, Parliament will get to vote the following day on whether it wants to leave the EU without a deal on March 29. This means the UK could willingly crash out of the EU without any transition plan.\nIf that no-deal motion gets defeated, Parliament will get to vote a third time. This vote, which would take place on March 14, will be to decide whether the UK should seek a limited extension to Article 50, the provision of the EU treaty under which the UK is withdrawing from the bloc.\nThis short-term extension requires approval from the EU. It seems possible the EU will go for that, but it\u2019s not yet guaranteed.\nHow Parliament might respond to May\u2019s latest concession\nThe only sure thing about May\u2019s new Brexit timeline is that the second week of March is going to be ... eventful.\nRight now, May and members of her government are jetting off to Brussels to meet with EU leaders to try to wring some concessions on the current withdrawal agreement \u2014 the same one the UK Parliament rejected in January.\nMay is specifically trying to secure changes to the \u201cIrish backstop,\u201d a part of the withdrawal deal that will guarantee the border between Northern Ireland (part of the UK) and the Republic of Ireland remains open, no matter what the future EU-UK relationship looks like. (For more on this, and why it\u2019s so controversial, read Vox\u2019s explainer.)\nThese talks seem to be going nowhere, which means that whatever May brings back to Parliament will look a lot like the same deal that everyone hated last month. But there\u2019s an outside chance that May\u2019s deal will pass in March, because it might end up being the least-bad option both for members of Parliament (MPs) who desperately want to divorce the EU and for those who want to remain.\nRemember, May is offering two votes if her deal fails: one on a no-deal Brexit and another on extending the Brexit deadline. Right now, the majority of MPs don\u2019t want a no-deal exit because it will likely be extraordinarily disruptive. There are legitimate questions about how prepared UK businesses and residents are for this scenario with just a few weeks until March 29.\nBut not everyone is enamored with the idea of extending the Brexit deadline, either. And the people who really hate this idea are the Brexiteers who are already freaking out about the possibility of a delay and framing it as a \u201cplot\u201d to undo Brexit altogether.\nSo Brexiteers \u2014 and others who support Brexit but don\u2019t want to see a no-deal scenario \u2014 may give in and choose May\u2019s deal to avoid what they see as a worse scenario: postponing the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. And if pro-Remain MPs fear the possibility, even if its small, that Parliament somehow votes for a no-deal Brexit before it has a chance to extend the deadline, they might be convinced to back May\u2019s deal.\nThat\u2019s still probably not enough to push May\u2019s deal over the edge; she still has to overcome a 230-point deficit. And now that May has put the option of delaying Brexit on the table, everyone who has a competing vision for a better Brexit outcome \u2014 a \u201csofter\u201d Brexit or a second referendum \u2014 might think that getting an extension is the best way to achieve it.\nMay\u2019s announcement probably does make a Brexit extension likely. But to what end, really?\nMay\u2019s decision on Tuesday represents a major shift in her position. She had previously stuck to the ultimatum: pass the Brexit deal, or leave without one altogether on March 29.\nHer about-face seems to have been an attempt to stave off a revolt from Remainers in her party, specifically those in her Cabinet who were seething that May hadn\u2019t ruled out a no-deal Brexit and threatened to resign.\nAnd on Wednesday, Parliament is expected to vote on a bunch of amendments that may potentially give MPs more control over Brexit. One proposed amendment, brought forward by a Labour MP and a Conservative MP, would have delayed the Brexit deadline if May\u2019s deal failed in March. So May, it seems, calculated that rather than risking giving Parliament all the power, she would head them off.\nParliament is extremely divided, but the majority support avoiding a no-deal exit. Even the UK\u2019s own government has said that many sectors of the economy are unprepared for the massive disruptions and economic shock that would occur if this happened on March 29. So if May\u2019s deal fails again, it seems likely that extending the deadline would pass Parliament.\nThe big question is: If Parliament approves a delay, what will it even accomplish?\nIf the Brexit deadline is pushed back, the UK must still pass some sort of deal or come to a consensus on how to leave the EU. Extending the Brexit date does not eliminate the possibility of a no-deal Brexit \u2014 it just delays the disaster for a few more months.\nAnd the UK can\u2019t just decide on its own to delay. Even a short-term extension still requires EU approval.\nEU leaders have so far been fairly reluctant to grant the UK an extension unless there\u2019s a legitimate reason \u2014 something that could fundamentally change the Brexit outcome, such as another referendum vote on whether to leave the EU or new general elections.\nIn other words, the EU doesn\u2019t really want to give the UK more time to argue about a Brexit deal they might have already voted down twice. But the EU also wants to avoid the chaos of a no-deal scenario, so it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll relent.\nThere are complications here, too. Specifically, the European Parliamentary elections, which are taking place in May. The newly elected EU Parliament takes over on July 1, so any delay longer than a few months would mean the UK would have to participate in those elections.\nThe EU has reportedly floated the idea of offering the UK an extension until 2021, especially since it\u2019s uncertain what a short-term delay can accomplish. It would give the EU and UK time to reset and figure out their future relationship, but it also sounds like Brexiteer and Leave supporters\u2019 worst nightmare.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that many opponents of Brexit would seize on any length of extension to try to push through a new plan. This is where the elusive second referendum comes in, essentially a public vote on the future of Brexit. May remains opposed.\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated on Monday that he\u2019d be open to supporting a second referendum if his Brexit plan fails in Parliament this week, which is almost guaranteed. But Corbyn\u2019s shift is causing even more fractures within Labour, and it\u2019s not yet clear a referendum would garner enough votes in Parliament.\nAll of which is to say, a no-deal Brexit is looking a little less likely \u2014 at least on March 29.",

Net migration to other parts of the U.S. from the nation&rsquo;s largest state was more than 100,000 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, according to the Census Bureau. Total emigration from California to other states between 2006 and 2017 was 1.24 million, according to the Census Bureau, third highest in the nation behind only New York and Illinois.</p>\n<p>For many former Californians, the high cost of living in the Golden State came to outweigh its balmy climate and booming economy. California has some of the highest utility bills and taxes in the country and the median home price soared 83% between 2012 and 2018, according to real-estate listings company <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/ZG\">Zillow Group</a> Inc. Buying a house is unaffordable to all but 28% of the state&rsquo;s population, according to an index by the California Association of Realtors that measures the percentage of people in the state who can afford to buy a single-family, median-priced home.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56047?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>John Falkenthal says of his move from California to Henderson: &lsquo;My quality of life went up the day I moved here.&rsquo; </h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re moving out of the state for less expensive housing,&rdquo; said Mohamed Hassan, a real-estate broker in Woodland Hills, Calif., who helped three clients sell their homes last year to relocate elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Ex-Californians have flocked to neighboring states like Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Arizona, which are among the fastest growing in the country. Few places have been as affected as Henderson, whose population surged 20% in the last decade to more than 300,000, pushing it past Reno to become Nevada&rsquo;s second most populous city.</p>\n<p>Fifty-six percent of new arrivals in Henderson between 2013 and 2017 were from California, according to Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles data. Home sales in many of the city&rsquo;s master-planned communities have been dominated by migrants from the West.</p>\n<p>At the 1,300-acre MacDonald Highlands in the dusty bluffs overlooking Las Vegas, Californians accounted for about 70% of purchases in 2018, compared with 30% 20 years ago, said Rich MacDonald, the developer. He said he began increasing the share of his marketing targeting Californians over the past three years after seeing the run-up in housing costs there.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re tired of getting their pockets picked,&rdquo; Mr. MacDonald said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Falkenthal initially looked for a house in San Diego after selling his former home following a divorce three years ago. But his half of the proceeds, about $250,000, would have paid for only a small townhouse or condo in the coastal area where he lived, he said.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56242?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Fifty-six percent of new arrivals in Henderson between 2013 and 2017 were from California.</h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Instead, he bought a three-bedroom, two-story house in Henderson in October for $416,000.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My quality of life went up the day I moved here,&rdquo; said Mr. Falkenthal pointing to his pool table and his musical equipment.</p>\n<p>Former Californians are finding plenty of familiar sights and people. The Oakland Raiders in January broke ground on a new headquarters and practice facility in Henderson for the team&rsquo;s coming move to Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Mr. Clune, 62 years old, and his wife Cindy, 63, both retirees, persuaded their daughter and cousin, along with two other couples, to follow them to Henderson after they moved here three years ago. In addition to saving money, escaping the California traffic was a big draw. Mr. Clune said he used to spend as much as two hours each way commuting from his home in Temecula to his manufacturing business in North Hollywood.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Here, they complain if you have to spend 30 minutes in traffic,&rdquo; Mr. Clune said.</p>\n<p>There are things he and his wife miss in California, though. &ldquo;We have four grandkids there, and would love to see them more often,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And the beach is nice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Henderson got its start in World War II as a supplier of magnesium for munitions and airplane parts. As Las Vegas began to sprawl, it became known for master-planned communities such as Lake Las Vegas, where singer Celine Dion and other celebrities live.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of Nevada, Henderson suffered as housing prices crashed during the recession a decade ago. But it came back with a vengeance as the Las Vegas metro economy rebounded, thanks in part to a tourism resurgence.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56053?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Few places have been as affected as Henderson, whose population surged 20% in the last decade to more than 300,000, pushing it past Reno to become Nevada&rsquo;s second most populous city.</h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now, Henderson is feeling some growing pains from the California influx. Schools are becoming crowded. Enrollment in the Nevada State High School at Henderson rose to 350 from 200 three years ago and is at its full capacity, school officials say.</p>\n<p>Two more campuses of the state charter high school system are in the works in Henderson, said John Hawk, chief operations officer for the school district.</p>\n<p>Average housing prices in the Las Vegas metro area rose to $278,000 in 2019 from $120,000 in 2012, according to Zillow. The increase has pressured some locals looking to buy, but 47% of Vegas-area residents can still afford it, said Jeremy Aguero, principal of Nevada consulting firm Applied Analysis. That is down from 88% after the last recession, he said.</p>\n<p>Not everyone is enamored of the California migration, though. Melissa Winders, a 48-year-old church ministry assistant, said she and her husband had a difficult time buying a home 12 years ago outside Henderson because of Californians outbidding them with all-cash offers. And she said she sees the same thing happening again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It does hurt the locals,&rdquo; Ms. Winders said, &ldquo;just because they don&rsquo;t have the cash like the Californians do.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56043?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>As Las Vegas began to sprawl, it became known for master-planned communities such as Lake Las Vegas.

                "text": "\u201cI never even considered leaving Southern California, but it took me every dime I had to buy a home there,\u201d said the 54-year-old Mr. Falkenthal, a software engineer who moved to Henderson from San Diego last October.\nCalifornia has been losing more residents than it gains from other states for years, even though its population of 40 million keeps growing from births and foreign immigration.\nBut the outflow has accelerated lately. Net migration to other parts of the U.S. from the nation\u2019s largest state was more than 100,000 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, according to the Census Bureau. Total emigration from California to other states between 2006 and 2017 was 1.24 million, according to the Census Bureau, third highest in the nation behind only New York and Illinois.\nFor many former Californians, the high cost of living in the Golden State came to outweigh its balmy climate and booming economy. California has some of the highest utility bills and taxes in the country and the median home price soared 83% between 2012 and 2018, according to real-estate listings company Zillow Group Inc. Buying a house is unaffordable to all but 28% of the state\u2019s population, according to an index by the California Association of Realtors that measures the percentage of people in the state who can afford to buy a single-family, median-priced home.\n\u201cThey\u2019re moving out of the state for less expensive housing,\u201d said Mohamed Hassan, a real-estate broker in Woodland Hills, Calif., who helped three clients sell their homes last year to relocate elsewhere.\nEx-Californians have flocked to neighboring states like Nevada, Idaho, Utah and Arizona, which are among the fastest growing in the country. Few places have been as affected as Henderson, whose population surged 20% in the last decade to more than 300,000, pushing it past Reno to become Nevada\u2019s second most populous city.\nFifty-six percent of new arrivals in Henderson between 2013 and 2017 were from California, according to Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles data. Home sales in many of the city\u2019s master-planned communities have been dominated by migrants from the West.\nAt the 1,300-acre MacDonald Highlands in the dusty bluffs overlooking Las Vegas, Californians accounted for about 70% of purchases in 2018, compared with 30% 20 years ago, said Rich MacDonald, the developer. He said he began increasing the share of his marketing targeting Californians over the past three years after seeing the run-up in housing costs there.\n\u201cThey\u2019re tired of getting their pockets picked,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said.\nMr. Falkenthal initially looked for a house in San Diego after selling his former home following a divorce three years ago. But his half of the proceeds, about $250,000, would have paid for only a small townhouse or condo in the coastal area where he lived, he said.\nInstead, he bought a three-bedroom, two-story house in Henderson in October for $416,000.\n\u201cMy quality of life went up the day I moved here,\u201d said Mr. Falkenthal pointing to his pool table and his musical equipment.\nFormer Californians are finding plenty of familiar sights and people. The Oakland Raiders in January broke ground on a new headquarters and practice facility in Henderson for the team\u2019s coming move to Las Vegas.\nMr. Clune, 62 years old, and his wife Cindy, 63, both retirees, persuaded their daughter and cousin, along with two other couples, to follow them to Henderson after they moved here three years ago. In addition to saving money, escaping the California traffic was a big draw. Mr. Clune said he used to spend as much as two hours each way commuting from his home in Temecula to his manufacturing business in North Hollywood.\n\u201cHere, they complain if you have to spend 30 minutes in traffic,\u201d Mr. Clune said.\nThere are things he and his wife miss in California, though. \u201cWe have four grandkids there, and would love to see them more often,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the beach is nice.\u201d\nHenderson got its start in World War II as a supplier of magnesium for munitions and airplane parts. As Las Vegas began to sprawl, it became known for master-planned communities such as Lake Las Vegas, where singer Celine Dion and other celebrities live.\nLike the rest of Nevada, Henderson suffered as housing prices crashed during the recession a decade ago. But it came back with a vengeance as the Las Vegas metro economy rebounded, thanks in part to a tourism resurgence.\nNow, Henderson is feeling some growing pains from the California influx. Schools are becoming crowded. Enrollment in the Nevada State High School at Henderson rose to 350 from 200 three years ago and is at its full capacity, school officials say.\nTwo more campuses of the state charter high school system are in the works in Henderson, said John Hawk, chief operations officer for the school district.\nAverage housing prices in the Las Vegas metro area rose to $278,000 in 2019 from $120,000 in 2012, according to Zillow. The increase has pressured some locals looking to buy, but 47% of Vegas-area residents can still afford it, said Jeremy Aguero, principal of Nevada consulting firm Applied Analysis. That is down from 88% after the last recession, he said.\nNot everyone is enamored of the California migration, though. Melissa Winders, a 48-year-old church ministry assistant, said she and her husband had a difficult time buying a home 12 years ago outside Henderson because of Californians outbidding them with all-cash offers. And she said she sees the same thing happening again.\n\u201cIt does hurt the locals,\u201d Ms. Winders said, \u201cjust because they don\u2019t have the cash like the Californians do.\u201d\nWrite to Jim Carlton at jim.carlton@wsj.com",

Upon leaving the hearing after nearly nine hours, he said he appreciated the opportunity to &ldquo;clear the record and to tell the truth,&rdquo; adding he looked forward to telling his story &ldquo;in my voice&rdquo; on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to let the American people decide exactly who&rsquo;s telling the truth,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Referring to Tuesday&rsquo;s closed-door testimony, Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say the tone was serious.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some Republican lawmakers attacked Mr. Cohen ahead of Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing. <a href=\"mailto:Rep\">Rep</a>. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) tweeted Tuesday at Mr. Cohen: &ldquo;Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time to chat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, called the tweet a &ldquo;new low.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s testimony on Wednesday is expected to focus on his &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; accounts of working for Mr. Trump for over a decade, a period during which Mr. Cohen plans to say he witnessed &ldquo;lies, racism and cheating&rdquo; by Mr. Trump, the person said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen is expected to recount racist remarks Mr. Trump allegedly made to him, including instances in which Mr. Trump allegedly questioned the intelligence of African-Americans and criticized their lifestyle choices, the person said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s planned testimony comes 13 months after the Journal first reported that <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678?mod=article_inline\">Mr. Cohen paid $130,000</a> in October 2016 to former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence after she alleged having a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.</p>\n<figure>An error occurred.

Clary/AFP/Getty Images) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>In his testimony Wednesday, Mr. Cohen will provide documentation of his reimbursement for the $130,000 Clifford payment, which he received in monthly installments of $35,000 throughout 2017, the person familiar with his testimony said. Mr. Cohen intends to show the panel a signed check, the person said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump signed some of the checks reimbursing Mr. Cohen, which Mr. Cohen began receiving after Mr. Trump took office, according to another person familiar with the payments.</p>\n<p>The payments to Mr. Cohen were characterized by Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg as legal fees, but federal prosecutors have said the monthly invoices weren&rsquo;t in connection with any legal services Mr. Cohen provided at that time.</p>\n<p>After the 2016 election, Mr. Weisselberg authorized a payment of double what Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford to cover related income taxes, as well as adding a $60,000 bonus, the Journal has previously reported.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Journal&rsquo;s revelations, federal prosecutors investigated Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s activities, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-raids-trump-lawyers-office-1523306297?mod=article_inline\">raided his home</a>, hotel room and office, and began probing the business practices of the Trump Organization, including whether it committed campaign-finance violations. The Trump Organization investigation, spearheaded by the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan, is continuing, people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n<p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement called Mr. Cohen a &ldquo;disgraced felon&rdquo; and noted that he had previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making other false statements.</p>\n<h4>Register for WSJ&rsquo;s Cohen Testimony Conference Call</h4>\n<p>Join WSJ journalists on Feb. 28 as they discuss what Michael Cohen&rsquo;s House testimony could mean for President Trump. Register <a href=\"https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1949222/E164B6C9E50650C1238C46D6DE3C0AC5?mod=article_inline\">here</a>, and send your questions to subscribercall@wsj.com.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokesman for the Trump Organization didn&rsquo;t respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen agreed to testify before the committee at the behest of its Democratic chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, after postponing his scheduled hearing last month, citing public statements by Mr. Trump he saw as threats toward members of his family.</p>\n<p>In August Mr. Cohen implicated the Republican president in two federal crimes when he told prosecutors Mr. Trump directed <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601?mod=article_inline\">hush-money payments</a> during the 2016 campaign to Ms. Clifford and to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/national-enquirer-shielded-donald-trump-from-playboy-models-affair-allegation-1478309380?mod=article_inline\">alleged she had an affair with Mr. Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>The person familiar with Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s anticipated testimony said Mr. Cohen would provide &ldquo;evidence of criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president,&rdquo; but other than saying it involved the Clifford payment, wouldn&rsquo;t offer more specifics before Wednesday&rsquo;s House hearing.</p>\n<p>The hearing would be the first time Mr. Cohen alleges that Mr. Trump committed a crime while in office. While the payments to both women were made in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump has faced questions from reporters about his possible knowledge of Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s subsequent reimbursement for the Clifford payment, as well as about whether he discussed with Mr. Cohen efforts to conceal the payment after the Journal first reported its existence in January 2018.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>The president has denied the sexual encounters with the women as well as ordering Mr. Cohen to arrange the payments to them.</p>\n<p>In December, federal prosecutors in New York for the first time directly implicated the president in the payoff scheme, referring to him in court papers as &ldquo;Individual-1,&rdquo; alleging that Mr. Trump had played a key role in the hush payments, as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601?mod=article_inline\">the Journal had previously detailed in its reporting</a>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes in August, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, and to one count of lying to Congress in November. He is expected on Wednesday to express contrition about the crimes he committed and acknowledge his mistakes, the person said. He will attest to having lied repeatedly to protect Mr. Trump and to what led him to publicly break with the president last summer, the person said. He will also reiterate that he wouldn&rsquo;t accept a presidential pardon from Mr. Trump if one were offered, the person said. Mr. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison term on May 6.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen plans to give his most detailed public account to date of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s alleged direction of the hush payments, as well as how Mr. Trump was involved in efforts to conceal them from the public weeks before the 2016 election, according to the person.</p>\n<p>He also plans to allege that Mr. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization&rsquo;s chief financial officer, was involved in those efforts, the person said.</p>\n<p>The Journal first detailed Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s account to prosecutors of Mr. Weisselberg&rsquo;s involvement in November. Mr. Weisselberg was granted immunity by federal prosecutors in the investigation and testified before a grand jury, according to a people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>A lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen spent more than a decade working for Mr. Trump, first at the Trump Organization and later as his personal lawyer. But the pair had <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-he-doing-here-inside-trumps-turbulent-relationship-with-michael-cohen-1529061564?mod=article_inline\">an often turbulent relationship</a>: Mr. Trump at one point asked senior aides to persuade Mr. Cohen to resign, and later slashed his annual income of more than $400,000 roughly in half, the Journal has previously reported.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Cohen for more than a decade remained unswervingly loyal, and ultimately found a niche as a fixer of some of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s thornier problems. In 2017, Mr. Cohen told Vanity Fair: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.&rdquo; Less than a year later, Mr. Cohen publicly broke with the president, saying he was putting his family and country first.</p>\n<h4>More</h4>\n<p>In a memo released last week, Mr. Cummings said that in addition to the hush-money payments, Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s testimony would focus on the president&rsquo;s compliance with tax laws, his &ldquo;potential and actual conflicts of interest,&rdquo; his business practices and &ldquo;the accuracy of the President&rsquo;s public statements,&rdquo; among other matters.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen won&rsquo;t answer questions related to special counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Trump has denied collusion, as has Russia.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen is expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 to play down Mr. Trump&rsquo;s involvement in efforts during the campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow but isn&rsquo;t expected to say whether Mr. Trump had directed him to make those misstatements, according to the person familiar with Wednesday&rsquo;s planned testimony. Mr. Cohen will tell the committee that Mr. Trump continued to inquire about the project months past January 2016&mdash;the month Mr. Cohen cited before Congress in 2017 as when the project ended, this person said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen is set to speak before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.</p>\n<p>Republicans on the Oversight Committee plan to try to undercut and discredit Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s testimony by raising questions about his motivations for speaking to Congress.</p>\n<p>Republicans plan to ask Mr. Cohen the reason for the &ldquo;sudden righteousness&rdquo; that led him to plead guilty and implicate the president in crimes, according to a GOP lawmaker on the committee. They also plan to ask who is paying his legal fees; why he fired his former attorney, Guy Petrillo ; and to whom he has spoken about his conversations with investigators, the lawmaker said.</p>\n<p>In a letter last week to the chairman, GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina accused the panel under Mr. Cummings&rsquo;s leadership of being &ldquo;out to attack the president for partisan gain,&rdquo; noting that Mr. Cohen had previously lied to Congress in a 2017 hearing. They said they intended to question Mr. Cohen about his &ldquo;conduct throughout his professional life and any other financial dealings he has had, including with his father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The documents Mr. Cohen plans to discuss in his public testimony partly reflect a way for Mr. Cohen to deflect attacks from Republican members of the committee, the person familiar with his plans said, adding: &ldquo;He expects to be called a liar.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Nicole Hong and Michael Rothfeld contributed to this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Rebecca Ballhaus at <a href=\"mailto:Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com\">Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com</a> and Warren P.

                "text": "On Tuesday morning, Mr. Cohen met behind closed doors with the Senate Intelligence Committee. Upon leaving the hearing after nearly nine hours, he said he appreciated the opportunity to \u201cclear the record and to tell the truth,\u201d adding he looked forward to telling his story \u201cin my voice\u201d on Wednesday.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let the American people decide exactly who\u2019s telling the truth,\u201d he said.\nReferring to Tuesday\u2019s closed-door testimony, Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), said, \u201cI\u2019d say the tone was serious.\u201d\nSome Republican lawmakers attacked Mr. Cohen ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) tweeted Tuesday at Mr. Cohen: \u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time to chat.\u201d\nLanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, called the tweet a \u201cnew low.\u201d\nMr. Cohen\u2019s testimony on Wednesday is expected to focus on his \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d accounts of working for Mr. Trump for over a decade, a period during which Mr. Cohen plans to say he witnessed \u201clies, racism and cheating\u201d by Mr. Trump, the person said.\nMr. Cohen is expected to recount racist remarks Mr. Trump allegedly made to him, including instances in which Mr. Trump allegedly questioned the intelligence of African-Americans and criticized their lifestyle choices, the person said.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s planned testimony comes 13 months after the Journal first reported that Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 in October 2016 to former adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence after she alleged having a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nIn his testimony Wednesday, Mr. Cohen will provide documentation of his reimbursement for the $130,000 Clifford payment, which he received in monthly installments of $35,000 throughout 2017, the person familiar with his testimony said. Mr. Cohen intends to show the panel a signed check, the person said.\nMr. Trump signed some of the checks reimbursing Mr. Cohen, which Mr. Cohen began receiving after Mr. Trump took office, according to another person familiar with the payments.\nThe payments to Mr. Cohen were characterized by Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg as legal fees, but federal prosecutors have said the monthly invoices weren\u2019t in connection with any legal services Mr. Cohen provided at that time.\nAfter the 2016 election, Mr. Weisselberg authorized a payment of double what Mr. Cohen had paid Ms. Clifford to cover related income taxes, as well as adding a $60,000 bonus, the Journal has previously reported.\nIn the wake of the Journal\u2019s revelations, federal prosecutors investigated Mr. Cohen\u2019s activities, raided his home, hotel room and office, and began probing the business practices of the Trump Organization, including whether it committed campaign-finance violations. The Trump Organization investigation, spearheaded by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, is continuing, people familiar with the matter said.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders in a statement called Mr. Cohen a \u201cdisgraced felon\u201d and noted that he had previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress and making other false statements.\nRegister for WSJ\u2019s Cohen Testimony Conference Call\nJoin WSJ journalists on Feb. 28 as they discuss what Michael Cohen\u2019s House testimony could mean for President Trump. Register here, and send your questions to subscribercall@wsj.com.\n\u201cSadly, he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d\nA spokesman for the Trump Organization didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nMr. Cohen agreed to testify before the committee at the behest of its Democratic chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, after postponing his scheduled hearing last month, citing public statements by Mr. Trump he saw as threats toward members of his family.\nIn August Mr. Cohen implicated the Republican president in two federal crimes when he told prosecutors Mr. Trump directed hush-money payments during the 2016 campaign to Ms. Clifford and to former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\nThe person familiar with Mr. Cohen\u2019s anticipated testimony said Mr. Cohen would provide \u201cevidence of criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president,\u201d but other than saying it involved the Clifford payment, wouldn\u2019t offer more specifics before Wednesday\u2019s House hearing.\nThe hearing would be the first time Mr. Cohen alleges that Mr. Trump committed a crime while in office. While the payments to both women were made in the weeks before the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump has faced questions from reporters about his possible knowledge of Mr. Cohen\u2019s subsequent reimbursement for the Clifford payment, as well as about whether he discussed with Mr. Cohen efforts to conceal the payment after the Journal first reported its existence in January 2018.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nThe president has denied the sexual encounters with the women as well as ordering Mr. Cohen to arrange the payments to them.\nIn December, federal prosecutors in New York for the first time directly implicated the president in the payoff scheme, referring to him in court papers as \u201cIndividual-1,\u201d alleging that Mr. Trump had played a key role in the hush payments, as the Journal had previously detailed in its reporting.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty to eight federal crimes in August, including tax evasion and making false statements to a bank, and to one count of lying to Congress in November. He is expected on Wednesday to express contrition about the crimes he committed and acknowledge his mistakes, the person said. He will attest to having lied repeatedly to protect Mr. Trump and to what led him to publicly break with the president last summer, the person said. He will also reiterate that he wouldn\u2019t accept a presidential pardon from Mr. Trump if one were offered, the person said. Mr. Cohen is scheduled to begin a three-year prison term on May 6.\nMr. Cohen plans to give his most detailed public account to date of Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged direction of the hush payments, as well as how Mr. Trump was involved in efforts to conceal them from the public weeks before the 2016 election, according to the person.\nHe also plans to allege that Mr. Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer, was involved in those efforts, the person said.\nThe Journal first detailed Mr. Cohen\u2019s account to prosecutors of Mr. Weisselberg\u2019s involvement in November. Mr. Weisselberg was granted immunity by federal prosecutors in the investigation and testified before a grand jury, according to a people familiar with the matter.\nA lawyer for Mr. Weisselberg declined to comment.\nMr. Cohen spent more than a decade working for Mr. Trump, first at the Trump Organization and later as his personal lawyer. But the pair had an often turbulent relationship: Mr. Trump at one point asked senior aides to persuade Mr. Cohen to resign, and later slashed his annual income of more than $400,000 roughly in half, the Journal has previously reported.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Cohen for more than a decade remained unswervingly loyal, and ultimately found a niche as a fixer of some of Mr. Trump\u2019s thornier problems. In 2017, Mr. Cohen told Vanity Fair: \u201cI\u2019m the guy who would take a bullet for the president.\u201d Less than a year later, Mr. Cohen publicly broke with the president, saying he was putting his family and country first.\nMore\nIn a memo released last week, Mr. Cummings said that in addition to the hush-money payments, Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony would focus on the president\u2019s compliance with tax laws, his \u201cpotential and actual conflicts of interest,\u201d his business practices and \u201cthe accuracy of the President\u2019s public statements,\u201d among other matters.\nMr. Cohen won\u2019t answer questions related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election, according to a person close to Mr. Cohen. Mr. Trump has denied collusion, as has Russia.\nMr. Cohen is expected to explain why he lied to Congress in 2017 to play down Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in efforts during the campaign to build a Trump Tower in Moscow but isn\u2019t expected to say whether Mr. Trump had directed him to make those misstatements, according to the person familiar with Wednesday\u2019s planned testimony. Mr. Cohen will tell the committee that Mr. Trump continued to inquire about the project months past January 2016\u2014the month Mr. Cohen cited before Congress in 2017 as when the project ended, this person said.\nMr. Cohen is set to speak before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday.\nRepublicans on the Oversight Committee plan to try to undercut and discredit Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony by raising questions about his motivations for speaking to Congress.\nRepublicans plan to ask Mr. Cohen the reason for the \u201csudden righteousness\u201d that led him to plead guilty and implicate the president in crimes, according to a GOP lawmaker on the committee. They also plan to ask who is paying his legal fees; why he fired his former attorney, Guy Petrillo ; and to whom he has spoken about his conversations with investigators, the lawmaker said.\nIn a letter last week to the chairman, GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina accused the panel under Mr. Cummings\u2019s leadership of being \u201cout to attack the president for partisan gain,\u201d noting that Mr. Cohen had previously lied to Congress in a 2017 hearing. They said they intended to question Mr. Cohen about his \u201cconduct throughout his professional life and any other financial dealings he has had, including with his father-in-law.\u201d\nThe documents Mr. Cohen plans to discuss in his public testimony partly reflect a way for Mr. Cohen to deflect attacks from Republican members of the committee, the person familiar with his plans said, adding: \u201cHe expects to be called a liar.\u201d\n\u2014Nicole Hong and Michael Rothfeld contributed to this article.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Warren P.

                "html": "<p>Last night Sen. Warren <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1107813046695673857?mod=article_inline\">tweeted</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>Slavery is a stain on America &amp; we need to address it head on. I believe it&rsquo;s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what&rsquo;s right &amp; begin to heal.</blockquote>\n<p>What would we do without experts? The reparations idea is always popular in the faculty lounge and occasionally pops up in national political conversation. But generally the debate doesn&rsquo;t last very long because it quickly becomes obvious that even if one wanted to ignore that reparations are incompatible with a justice system which respects the rights of individuals and doesn&rsquo;t hold them accountable for the offenses of others, it would be impossible to implement in the great American melting pot.</p>\n<p>Sen. Warren&rsquo;s panel of experts would have to decide, for example, how to categorize someone who is largely white but who may or may not be related to a person of color perhaps six to ten generations earlier. Also, would the experts rely on family lore or only on official records in deciding whose ancestors were guilty and whose were innocent? What if a person is descended from both victims and villains?</p>\n<p>Readers may recall that Ms. Warren is the former Harvard law professor <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warrens-unconstitutional-wealth-tax-11548442306?mod=article_inline\">pushing an unconstitutional wealth tax </a>and they may now decide that she probably shouldn&rsquo;t be teaching history, either. A few New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/sunday/elizabeth-warren-president-2020.html?action=click&emc=edit_ty_20190318&module=Opinion&nl=opinion-today&nlid=79306745emc=edit_ty_20190318&pgtype=Homepage&te=1&mod=article_inline\">writers</a> seem to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/us/politics/on-politics-elizabeth-warren-mississippi.html?mod=article_inline\">think that she&rsquo;s </a>the &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; candidate in the 2020 presidential field. But she seems to have no idea how the nation addressed &ldquo;head on&rdquo; the issue of slavery, nor does she seem to understand the price paid to end it.</p>\n<p>An organization called American Battlefield Trust, which seeks to preserve the land on which the Civil War was waged, <a href=\"https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/civil-war-casualties?mod=article_inline\">embraces the traditional estimate of</a> 620,000 men killed in uniform. But others believe this total understates the carnage. In 2011 Binghamton University <a href=\"https://discovere.binghamton.edu/news/civilwar-3826.html?mod=article_inline\">published a story </a>on new research into Civil War casualties by one of its faculty members:</p>\n<blockquote>A new analysis of census data suggests that this grisly era was even more costly than experts previously believed. Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker says the war&rsquo;s dead numbered about 750,000, an estimate that&rsquo;s 20 percent higher than the commonly cited figure of 620,000. His findings will be published in December in the journal Civil War History.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>&ldquo;The traditional estimate has become iconic,&rdquo; Hacker says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been quoted for the last hundred years or more. If you go with that total for a minute &mdash; 620,000 &mdash; the number of men dying in the Civil War is more than in all other American wars from the American Revolution through the Korean War combined. And consider that the American population in 1860 was about 31 million people, about one-tenth the size it is today. If the war were fought today, the number of deaths would total 6.2 million.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The 620,000 estimate, though widely cited, is also widely understood to be flawed. Neither the Union nor the Confederacy kept standardized personnel records. And the traditional estimate of Confederate war dead &mdash; 258,000 &mdash; was based on incomplete battle reports and a crude guess of deaths from disease and other non-combat causes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably shocking to most people today that neither army felt any moral obligation to count and name the dead or to notify survivors,&rdquo; Hacker says. &ldquo;About half the men killed in battles were buried without identification. Most records were geared toward determining troop strength.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>...Pulitzer Prize-winner James McPherson, the preeminent living historian of the war, says he finds Hacker&rsquo;s new estimate plausible. &ldquo;Even if it might not be quite as high as 750,000, I have always been convinced that the consensus figure of 620,000 is too low, and especially that the figure of 260,000 Confederate dead is definitely too low,&rdquo; McPherson says. &ldquo;My guess is that most of the difference between the estimate of 620,000 and Hacker&rsquo;s higher figure is the result of underreported Confederate deaths.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>The higher number means more combat deaths than in all of our country&rsquo;s other wars combined. And the enormous destruction was not confined to those mortally wounded in battle. Leave it to the New York Times to publish more than 3,000 words on the Civil War&rsquo;s environmental impact. In a 2014 Times piece, Brown University administrator Ted Widmer <a href=\"https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/the-civil-wars-environmental-impact/?mod=article_inline\">chronicled</a>, among other things, the fate of humans within the American ecosystem:</p>\n<blockquote>The war may have begun haltingly, but it soon became total, and in certain instances, a war upon civilians and the countryside as well as upon the opposing forces. Gen. William T. Sherman famously explained that he wanted the people of the South to feel &lsquo;&rsquo;the hard hand of war,&rsquo;&rsquo; and he cut a wide swath on his march to the sea in November and December 1864. &lsquo;&rsquo;We devoured the land,&rsquo;&rsquo; he wrote in a letter to his wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Gen. Philip H. Sheridan pursued a similar scorched-earth campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in September and October 1864, burning farms and factories and anything else that might be useful to the Confederates. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant told him to &lsquo;&rsquo;eat out Virginia clear and clear as far as they go, so that crows flying over it for the balance of the season will have to carry their provender with them.&rsquo;&rsquo;</blockquote>\n<p>Other flying creatures found their provender easily enough, according to Mr. Widmer:</p>\n<blockquote>Insects thrived in the camps, in part because the armies destroyed the forest habitats of the birds, bats and other predators that would keep pest populations down. Mosquitoes carried out their own form of aerial attack upon unsuspecting men from both sides. More than 1.3 million soldiers in the Union alone were affected by mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and yellow fever. An Ohio private. Isaac Jackson, wrote, &lsquo;&rsquo;the skeeters here are -- well, there is no use talking ... I never seen the like.&rsquo;&rsquo; Flies, ticks, maggots and chiggers added to the misery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The army camps were almost designed to attract them. Fetid latrines and impure water bred disease and did more to weaken the ranks than actual warfare. Some 1.6 million Union troops suffered from diarrhea and dysentery; Southern numbers were surely proportional. Rats were abundantly present on both sides, carrying germs and eating their way through any food they could find.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Probably the worst places of all were the prisoner camps. A Massachusetts private, Amos Stearns, wrote a two-line poem from his confinement in South Carolina: &lsquo;&rsquo;A Confederate prison is the place/Where hunting for lice is no disgrace.&rsquo;&rsquo; Some Alabama prisoners in a New York prison made a stew of the prison&rsquo;s rat population. (&rsquo;&rsquo;They taste very much like a young squirrel,&rsquo;&rsquo; wrote Lt. Edmund D. Patterson.)</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a safe bet that Sen. Warren has never suffered as captured soldiers did in that era, so perhaps she has not considered the price already paid.</p>\n<p>The American Battlefield Trust notes that available records of wounded soldiers did not include the full impact of the national trauma on those who survived:</p>\n<blockquote>Our modern conception of casualties includes those who have been psychologically damaged by warfare. This distinction did not exist during the Civil War. Soldiers suffering from what we would now recognize as post-traumatic stress disorder were uncatalogued and uncared for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Approximately one in four soldiers that went to war never returned home. At the outset of the war, neither army had mechanisms in place to handle the amount of death that the nation was about to experience. There were no national cemeteries, no burial details, and no messengers of loss. </blockquote>\n<p>And among politicians like Sen. Warren, there seems to be no recognition of the horrors of the Civil War.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>Bottom Stories of the Day will return tomorrow.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/freemanwsj?mod=article_inline\">Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</a> </em></p>\n<p><em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/newsletters?sub=best_of_the_web_today&mod=article_inline\">Subscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.</a> </em></p>\n<p><em>To suggest items, please email <a href=\"mailto:best@wsj.com\">best@wsj.com</a>.</em></p>\n<p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.

                "text": "Last night Sen. Warren tweeted:\nSlavery is a stain on America & we need to address it head on. I believe it\u2019s time to start a national, full-blown conversation about reparations. I support the bill in the House to support a congressional panel of experts so that our nation can do what\u2019s right & begin to heal.\nWhat would we do without experts? The reparations idea is always popular in the faculty lounge and occasionally pops up in national political conversation. But generally the debate doesn\u2019t last very long because it quickly becomes obvious that even if one wanted to ignore that reparations are incompatible with a justice system which respects the rights of individuals and doesn\u2019t hold them accountable for the offenses of others, it would be impossible to implement in the great American melting pot.\nSen. Warren\u2019s panel of experts would have to decide, for example, how to categorize someone who is largely white but who may or may not be related to a person of color perhaps six to ten generations earlier. Also, would the experts rely on family lore or only on official records in deciding whose ancestors were guilty and whose were innocent? What if a person is descended from both victims and villains?\nReaders may recall that Ms. Warren is the former Harvard law professor pushing an unconstitutional wealth tax and they may now decide that she probably shouldn\u2019t be teaching history, either. A few New York Times writers seem to think that she\u2019s the \u201cideas\u201d candidate in the 2020 presidential field. But she seems to have no idea how the nation addressed \u201chead on\u201d the issue of slavery, nor does she seem to understand the price paid to end it.\nAn organization called American Battlefield Trust, which seeks to preserve the land on which the Civil War was waged, embraces the traditional estimate of 620,000 men killed in uniform. But others believe this total understates the carnage. In 2011 Binghamton University published a story on new research into Civil War casualties by one of its faculty members:\nA new analysis of census data suggests that this grisly era was even more costly than experts previously believed. Binghamton University historian J. David Hacker says the war\u2019s dead numbered about 750,000, an estimate that\u2019s 20 percent higher than the commonly cited figure of 620,000. His findings will be published in December in the journal Civil War History.\n\u201cThe traditional estimate has become iconic,\u201d Hacker says. \u201cIt\u2019s been quoted for the last hundred years or more. If you go with that total for a minute \u2014 620,000 \u2014 the number of men dying in the Civil War is more than in all other American wars from the American Revolution through the Korean War combined. And consider that the American population in 1860 was about 31 million people, about one-tenth the size it is today. If the war were fought today, the number of deaths would total 6.2 million.\u201d\nThe 620,000 estimate, though widely cited, is also widely understood to be flawed. Neither the Union nor the Confederacy kept standardized personnel records. And the traditional estimate of Confederate war dead \u2014 258,000 \u2014 was based on incomplete battle reports and a crude guess of deaths from disease and other non-combat causes. \u201cIt\u2019s probably shocking to most people today that neither army felt any moral obligation to count and name the dead or to notify survivors,\u201d Hacker says. \u201cAbout half the men killed in battles were buried without identification. Most records were geared toward determining troop strength.\u201d\n...Pulitzer Prize-winner James McPherson, the preeminent living historian of the war, says he finds Hacker\u2019s new estimate plausible. \u201cEven if it might not be quite as high as 750,000, I have always been convinced that the consensus figure of 620,000 is too low, and especially that the figure of 260,000 Confederate dead is definitely too low,\u201d McPherson says. \u201cMy guess is that most of the difference between the estimate of 620,000 and Hacker\u2019s higher figure is the result of underreported Confederate deaths.\u201d\nThe higher number means more combat deaths than in all of our country\u2019s other wars combined. And the enormous destruction was not confined to those mortally wounded in battle. Leave it to the New York Times to publish more than 3,000 words on the Civil War\u2019s environmental impact. In a 2014 Times piece, Brown University administrator Ted Widmer chronicled, among other things, the fate of humans within the American ecosystem:\nThe war may have begun haltingly, but it soon became total, and in certain instances, a war upon civilians and the countryside as well as upon the opposing forces. Gen. William T. Sherman famously explained that he wanted the people of the South to feel \u2018\u2019the hard hand of war,\u2019\u2019 and he cut a wide swath on his march to the sea in November and December 1864. \u2018\u2019We devoured the land,\u2019\u2019 he wrote in a letter to his wife.\nGen. Philip H. Sheridan pursued a similar scorched-earth campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in September and October 1864, burning farms and factories and anything else that might be useful to the Confederates. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant told him to \u2018\u2019eat out Virginia clear and clear as far as they go, so that crows flying over it for the balance of the season will have to carry their provender with them.\u2019\u2019\nOther flying creatures found their provender easily enough, according to Mr. Widmer:\nInsects thrived in the camps, in part because the armies destroyed the forest habitats of the birds, bats and other predators that would keep pest populations down. Mosquitoes carried out their own form of aerial attack upon unsuspecting men from both sides. More than 1.3 million soldiers in the Union alone were affected by mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and yellow fever. An Ohio private. Isaac Jackson, wrote, \u2018\u2019the skeeters here are -- well, there is no use talking ... I never seen the like.\u2019\u2019 Flies, ticks, maggots and chiggers added to the misery.\nThe army camps were almost designed to attract them. Fetid latrines and impure water bred disease and did more to weaken the ranks than actual warfare. Some 1.6 million Union troops suffered from diarrhea and dysentery; Southern numbers were surely proportional. Rats were abundantly present on both sides, carrying germs and eating their way through any food they could find.\nProbably the worst places of all were the prisoner camps. A Massachusetts private, Amos Stearns, wrote a two-line poem from his confinement in South Carolina: \u2018\u2019A Confederate prison is the place/Where hunting for lice is no disgrace.\u2019\u2019 Some Alabama prisoners in a New York prison made a stew of the prison\u2019s rat population. (\u2019\u2019They taste very much like a young squirrel,\u2019\u2019 wrote Lt. Edmund D. Patterson.)\nIt\u2019s a safe bet that Sen. Warren has never suffered as captured soldiers did in that era, so perhaps she has not considered the price already paid.\nThe American Battlefield Trust notes that available records of wounded soldiers did not include the full impact of the national trauma on those who survived:\nOur modern conception of casualties includes those who have been psychologically damaged by warfare. This distinction did not exist during the Civil War. Soldiers suffering from what we would now recognize as post-traumatic stress disorder were uncatalogued and uncared for.\nApproximately one in four soldiers that went to war never returned home. At the outset of the war, neither army had mechanisms in place to handle the amount of death that the nation was about to experience. There were no national cemeteries, no burial details, and no messengers of loss.\nAnd among politicians like Sen. Warren, there seems to be no recognition of the horrors of the Civil War.\n***\nBottom Stories of the Day will return tomorrow.\n***\nFollow James Freeman on Twitter.\nSubscribe to the Best of the Web email with one click.\nTo suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.\n(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.

                "html": "<p>&ldquo;There is a long history of discrimination in the areas of housing, employment, and credit, and this harmful behavior should not happen through Facebook ads,&rdquo; Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said in a blog post that will be published on Tuesday afternoon, according to a spokesman.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>Facebook has faced pressure on targeting around such ads for years, sparked by a 2016 report from investigative-news site ProPublica, which <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-lets-advertisers-exclude-users-by-race?mod=article_inline\">said it had been able to buy</a> ads targeted to house hunters that excluded certain groups based on ethnicity. While Facebook didn&rsquo;t allow targeting specifically by race, it lets advertisers seek consumers by criteria it calls &ldquo;ethnic affinity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Soon after that report, Facebook said it would no longer let marketers target housing, employment and credit-related ads by ethnic affinity.</p>\n<p>The company will now add further restrictions on targeting such ads to U.S. consumers. Geographic targets, for example, will have a minimum 15-mile radius from any specific address or city center, according to Facebook.

                "html": "<p>The condition can be treated with conventional surgery that uses a woman&rsquo;s own tissue. But some surgeons have maintained that the synthetic mesh product can lead to a more permanent repair. Mesh products also are used in hernia repair and urinary incontinence treatment, but these uses carry a lesser risk in the view of surgeons and they remain on the market.</p>\n<h4>Previous Coverage</h4>\n<p>Vaginal mesh products were first cleared in 1996 by the FDA for marketing. But complications, some severe, have been extensive, leading to litigation and billions of dollars in damages over crippling conditions and the need for multiple reoperations in many patients.</p>\n<p>Boston Scientific, in a statement, said the company was &ldquo;deeply disappointed by the FDA&rsquo;s decision&rdquo; regarding their products, adding: &ldquo;Patient safety is always our highest priority and we will work closely with the agency to understand its direction and determine next steps.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The company also said it believes &ldquo;the inaccessibility of these products will severely limit treatment options for the 50% of women in the U.S. who will suffer from pelvic organ prolapse during their lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The chief executive of Denmark-based Coloplast, Kristian Villumsen, said Wednesday the company was disappointed with the decision because it reduces the treatment options for women with pelvic organ prolapses. &ldquo;We remain committed to providing alternative therapies,&rdquo; Mr. Villumsen said in a news release.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the federal agency issued a notice that serious complications were linked to mesh in some cases. In 2011, it reinforced that message by saying that the complications weren&rsquo;t rare.</p>\n<p>In the FDA&rsquo;s search of its database on complications preparing for the safety hearing this year, it found 10,391 reports of serious injuries related to surgical mesh for women&rsquo;s pelvic repair. Further, it said, the reports listed 77 deaths possibly related to the devices.</p>\n<p>An advisory panel of outside doctors recommended to the FDA at the hearing this year that it take into account women&rsquo;s reports of pain, sexual dysfunction and other conditions in making its decision about whether mesh should stay on the market.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s lives have been changed, and in some cases ruined&rdquo; by mesh, according to hearing testimony from Diana Zuckerman, president of the consumer group National Center for Health Research.</p>\n<p>Both companies at the time of the hearing said they considered mesh safe, effective and an important treatment option. They will have 10 days to submit their plan to withdraw these products from the market, the FDA said.</p>\n<p>Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA&rsquo;s medical-device center, said the FDA needed evidence that mesh worked better than surgery without mesh in order to keep the devices on the market. &ldquo;That evidence was lacking,&rdquo; said Dr. Shuren, &ldquo;and we couldn&rsquo;t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long-term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shares of Boston Scientific were down 4.3% in trading on Tuesday. American depositary receipts in Coloplast were down 2.5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Thomas M.

                "text": "The condition can be treated with conventional surgery that uses a woman\u2019s own tissue. But some surgeons have maintained that the synthetic mesh product can lead to a more permanent repair. Mesh products also are used in hernia repair and urinary incontinence treatment, but these uses carry a lesser risk in the view of surgeons and they remain on the market.\nPrevious Coverage\nVaginal mesh products were first cleared in 1996 by the FDA for marketing. But complications, some severe, have been extensive, leading to litigation and billions of dollars in damages over crippling conditions and the need for multiple reoperations in many patients.\nBoston Scientific, in a statement, said the company was \u201cdeeply disappointed by the FDA\u2019s decision\u201d regarding their products, adding: \u201cPatient safety is always our highest priority and we will work closely with the agency to understand its direction and determine next steps.\u201d\nThe company also said it believes \u201cthe inaccessibility of these products will severely limit treatment options for the 50% of women in the U.S. who will suffer from pelvic organ prolapse during their lives.\u201d\nThe chief executive of Denmark-based Coloplast, Kristian Villumsen, said Wednesday the company was disappointed with the decision because it reduces the treatment options for women with pelvic organ prolapses. \u201cWe remain committed to providing alternative therapies,\u201d Mr. Villumsen said in a news release.\nIn 2008, the federal agency issued a notice that serious complications were linked to mesh in some cases. In 2011, it reinforced that message by saying that the complications weren\u2019t rare.\nIn the FDA\u2019s search of its database on complications preparing for the safety hearing this year, it found 10,391 reports of serious injuries related to surgical mesh for women\u2019s pelvic repair. Further, it said, the reports listed 77 deaths possibly related to the devices.\nAn advisory panel of outside doctors recommended to the FDA at the hearing this year that it take into account women\u2019s reports of pain, sexual dysfunction and other conditions in making its decision about whether mesh should stay on the market.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s lives have been changed, and in some cases ruined\u201d by mesh, according to hearing testimony from Diana Zuckerman, president of the consumer group National Center for Health Research.\nBoth companies at the time of the hearing said they considered mesh safe, effective and an important treatment option. They will have 10 days to submit their plan to withdraw these products from the market, the FDA said.\nJeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA\u2019s medical-device center, said the FDA needed evidence that mesh worked better than surgery without mesh in order to keep the devices on the market. \u201cThat evidence was lacking,\u201d said Dr. Shuren, \u201cand we couldn\u2019t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long-term.\u201d\nShares of Boston Scientific were down 4.3% in trading on Tuesday. American depositary receipts in Coloplast were down 2.5%.\nWrite to Thomas M.

This composition will be a matter of intense interest to the markets for those securities, with implications for the economy and monetary policy.</p>\n<p>The composition &ldquo;is more policy-relevant than many of the things people have discussed about the balance sheet,&rdquo; such as the size, said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in an interview last month.</p>\n<p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rate-projections-could-show-greater-confidence-in-extended-pause-11552820400?mod=article_inline&mod=article_inline\">the central bank is prepared to announce</a> Wednesday, after its two-day policy meeting, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-rate-projections-could-show-greater-confidence-in-extended-pause-11552820400?mod=hp_major_pos12&mod=article_inline\">when it will end the runoff</a> of its $4 trillion portfolio later this year. Officials are likely to take up the composition question this week, though the discussions are likely to continue for at least through their next meeting, which concludes May 1.</p>\n<p>Several Fed officials in recent interviews and public statements have expressed a preference for boosting their holdings of short-term bills, but they want to do it in a way that won&rsquo;t rattle markets.</p>\n<p>The Fed purchased trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and longer-dated Treasurys between 2008 and 2014 to spur growth. Officials believe holding long-term securities stimulates financial markets and the economy by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds. They think a portfolio weighted toward short-term Treasurys <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-4-trillion-scapegoat-for-market-volatility-the-feds-shrinking-portfolio-11548671432?mod=article_inline\">provides little stimulus</a>.</p>\n<p>Before the 2008 crisis, the average maturity of the Fed&rsquo;s Treasury holdings was less than four years. Now, it&rsquo;s around nine years. The average maturity of all Treasury debt outstanding is nearly six years.</p>\n<p>After the portfolio stops shrinking, the Fed will likely continue reducing its mortgage holdings by letting them mature, currently by around $15 billion a month. It could choose to invest the proceeds from maturing mortgage bonds into Treasurys.</p>\n<p>Fed officials are considering two different approaches to the composition question. Minutes from the central bank&rsquo;s December meeting show more officials favor weighting their holdings toward shorter-maturity holdings, returning the portfolio composition to something that reflects its precrisis configuration.</p>\n<p>A few officials at the meeting supported maintaining a mix of short-, medium- and long-term securities in proportions that would reflect the outstanding Treasury market. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, in an interview in January, said she prefers this strategy.</p>\n<p>Under the theory that buying and holding longer-term securities provides more stimulus, the first approach would be less stimulative to financial markets.</p>\n<p>The key appeal of this approach is that the Fed could more easily move to stimulate growth in a downturn by shifting back into long-term securities without first increasing its holdings, as it did during the bond-buying campaigns known as &ldquo;quantitative easing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It gives you more quantitative-easing ammunition if you define quantitative easing as not just size but duration,&rdquo; said William Dudley, who served as New York Fed president from 2009 to 2018, in a recent interview.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;It would be nice to have maximum room to use that instrument. If the Fed had a shorter-duration Treasury portfolio, they&rsquo;d have more room,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Rosengren has noted the Fed will have fewer tools to respond to the next downturn because lower nominal interest rates will leave the central bank with less room to cut them.</p>\n<p>He said in a February interview the Fed should consider shortening the duration of the Treasury portfolio now &ldquo;so that whenever we have that next recession, we have the ability to lengthen the maturity and take some of the duration out of the market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Fed doesn&rsquo;t currently buy any Treasurys with maturities of one year or less, which represent 15% of outstanding Treasury securities. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s remarkable is whichever of the two approaches they choose, they&rsquo;re going to have to buy a bunch of short-term paper,&rdquo; said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS who previously worked at both the Fed and the Treasury.</p>\n<p>One key consideration is how fast to transition to any new normal. One possible argument against moving to a bill-heavy portfolio is that it might tighten monetary policy more rapidly than some officials would want right now, though doing so more slowly could alleviate this concern.</p>\n<p>Fed officials agree they should move over time to a portfolio of only Treasury holdings, but this could take many years because their mortgage bonds won&rsquo;t fully mature for decades. At the recent pace of home refinancing, the Fed could still own around $500 billion in mortgage holdings at the middle of the next decade.</p>\n<p>Officials aren&rsquo;t eager to discuss the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-feds-unwinding-will-work-1505840459?mod=article_inline\">selling mortgage bonds</a> because they don&rsquo;t want to do anything to disturb an already fragile housing market.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At some juncture there might be a more active approach [to reducing the mortgage holdings], but that is certainly not something that I see as relevant in the shorter term,&rdquo; said Fed governor Lael Brainard earlier this month.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Nick Timiraos at <a href=\"mailto:nick.timiraos@wsj.com\">nick.timiraos@wsj.com</a></p>\n<p>Appeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Fed Faces Decision on the Mix of Treasurys to Hold.'</p>",

                "text": "Specifically, they need to decide the right combination of Treasurys of varying duration to hold\u2014whether mostly short-term bills or a mix that also includes more longer-term notes and bonds. This composition will be a matter of intense interest to the markets for those securities, with implications for the economy and monetary policy.\nThe composition \u201cis more policy-relevant than many of the things people have discussed about the balance sheet,\u201d such as the size, said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in an interview last month.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell has signaled the central bank is prepared to announce Wednesday, after its two-day policy meeting, when it will end the runoff of its $4 trillion portfolio later this year. Officials are likely to take up the composition question this week, though the discussions are likely to continue for at least through their next meeting, which concludes May 1.\nSeveral Fed officials in recent interviews and public statements have expressed a preference for boosting their holdings of short-term bills, but they want to do it in a way that won\u2019t rattle markets.\nThe Fed purchased trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities and longer-dated Treasurys between 2008 and 2014 to spur growth. Officials believe holding long-term securities stimulates financial markets and the economy by lowering long-term rates and driving investors into stocks and bonds. They think a portfolio weighted toward short-term Treasurys provides little stimulus.\nBefore the 2008 crisis, the average maturity of the Fed\u2019s Treasury holdings was less than four years. Now, it\u2019s around nine years. The average maturity of all Treasury debt outstanding is nearly six years.\nAfter the portfolio stops shrinking, the Fed will likely continue reducing its mortgage holdings by letting them mature, currently by around $15 billion a month. It could choose to invest the proceeds from maturing mortgage bonds into Treasurys.\nFed officials are considering two different approaches to the composition question. Minutes from the central bank\u2019s December meeting show more officials favor weighting their holdings toward shorter-maturity holdings, returning the portfolio composition to something that reflects its precrisis configuration.\nA few officials at the meeting supported maintaining a mix of short-, medium- and long-term securities in proportions that would reflect the outstanding Treasury market. Kansas City Fed President Esther George, in an interview in January, said she prefers this strategy.\nUnder the theory that buying and holding longer-term securities provides more stimulus, the first approach would be less stimulative to financial markets.\nThe key appeal of this approach is that the Fed could more easily move to stimulate growth in a downturn by shifting back into long-term securities without first increasing its holdings, as it did during the bond-buying campaigns known as \u201cquantitative easing.\u201d\n\u201cIt gives you more quantitative-easing ammunition if you define quantitative easing as not just size but duration,\u201d said William Dudley, who served as New York Fed president from 2009 to 2018, in a recent interview.\nRelated\n\u201cIt would be nice to have maximum room to use that instrument. If the Fed had a shorter-duration Treasury portfolio, they\u2019d have more room,\u201d he said.\nMr. Rosengren has noted the Fed will have fewer tools to respond to the next downturn because lower nominal interest rates will leave the central bank with less room to cut them.\nHe said in a February interview the Fed should consider shortening the duration of the Treasury portfolio now \u201cso that whenever we have that next recession, we have the ability to lengthen the maturity and take some of the duration out of the market.\u201d\nThe Fed doesn\u2019t currently buy any Treasurys with maturities of one year or less, which represent 15% of outstanding Treasury securities. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is whichever of the two approaches they choose, they\u2019re going to have to buy a bunch of short-term paper,\u201d said Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS who previously worked at both the Fed and the Treasury.\nOne key consideration is how fast to transition to any new normal. One possible argument against moving to a bill-heavy portfolio is that it might tighten monetary policy more rapidly than some officials would want right now, though doing so more slowly could alleviate this concern.\nFed officials agree they should move over time to a portfolio of only Treasury holdings, but this could take many years because their mortgage bonds won\u2019t fully mature for decades. At the recent pace of home refinancing, the Fed could still own around $500 billion in mortgage holdings at the middle of the next decade.\nOfficials aren\u2019t eager to discuss the possibility of selling mortgage bonds because they don\u2019t want to do anything to disturb an already fragile housing market.\n\u201cAt some juncture there might be a more active approach [to reducing the mortgage holdings], but that is certainly not something that I see as relevant in the shorter term,\u201d said Fed governor Lael Brainard earlier this month.\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com\nAppeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Fed Faces Decision on the Mix of Treasurys to Hold.'",

                "text": "But in an unusual provision, the agreement also calls for the defendants to review the evidence in the case and agree that, if it were to go to trial, the state would be able to prove their guilt, this person said. It isn\u2019t clear whether Mr. Kraft and others would accept such a condition. When the charges were announced, a spokesman for Mr. Kraft denied he engaged in illegal activity.\nA spokesman for the state attorney\u2019s office said that it is the standard resolution for first-time offenders, or they go to trial. A spokeswoman for the Jupiter Police Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nMr. Kraft, whose Patriots won the Super Bowl in February, was one of more than two dozen men charged with solicitation last month in Jupiter as part of a multi-city investigation into multiple South Florida spas. One of those locations was Orchids of Asia Day Spa, which Mr. Kraft allegedly visited and received sex acts. Prosecutors charged him with two counts of soliciting prostitution, acts they say were caught on video surveillance. Mr. Kraft has pleaded not guilty.\nLegal experts have raised questions about the tactics Jupiter, Fla., police used in obtaining search warrants for an investigation they said was intended to stop a growing human trafficking problem.\nProsecutors and law-enforcement officials had described the investigation as a probe into human trafficking and portrayed the men who patronized the spas as contributing to the demand for sex slavery. In announcing the charges, Dave Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, had called human trafficking \u201cevil in our midst,\u201d echoing the rhetoric of law-enforcement officials.\nBut no one has been charged with human trafficking in the case. Prosecutors\u2019 affidavits have not detailed evidence of human trafficking at Orchids of Asia Day Spa.\n\u201cThe police are making this case that this is a major human trafficking ring, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so serious,\u201d said Duncan Levin, a former federal prosecutor and managing partner of Tucker Levin, PLLC who is not connected to the case. \u201cThe fact that they had cameras installed in the locations for so long somewhat undermines the claim that there was an extraordinary danger to the people working in the establishment.\u201d\nThe Jupiter Police Department began its investigation in October, according to affidavits and in January installed covert surveillance equipment. Men who visited the spas, including Mr. Kraft, were seen engaging in sex acts and identified after their visits on traffic stops, according to court documents. Legal experts have said the traffic stops could be argued as pretextual.\nProsecutors alleged they saw Mr. Kraft, 77 years old, enter Orchids of Asia Day Spa, located in a small strip mall, on two occasions and saw him pay cash and receive sex acts. He was identified in a traffic stop after his first visit on Jan. 19, when he was the passenger in a vehicle, and visited the spa again the next day, before the Patriots played the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game.\nAt least one of the women Mr. Kraft was alleged to have engaged with was an operator of the spa, while both were licensed, according to Florida Department of Health records.\nMr. Kraft could still face punishment from the NFL, which has said in regards to him that the league\u2019s \u201cpersonal conduct policy applies equally to everyone.\u201d The league said it would \u201ctake appropriate action as warranted based on the facts.\u201d\nThe league has previously disciplined players in cases where they were not prosecuted.\n\u201cI think Kraft\u2019s biggest problem is going to be NFL management,\u201d said David Weinstein, a Miami lawyer and former prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida. \u201cTheir standards are far lower than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nMore\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com\nAppeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Patriots Owner Kraft Is Offered Plea Deal if He Makes Admission.'",

                "html": "<p>U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton had previously sentenced onetime Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni, 47 years old, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-christie-ally-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison-for-bridgegate-role-1490805354?mod=article_inline\">to two years in prison</a>. She sentenced Mr. Baroni a second time Tuesday because a federal appeals court tossed a portion of his 2016 conviction.</p>\n<p>After a jury trial, Mr. Baroni and Bridget Kelly, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-christie-allies-guilty-on-all-counts-in-george-washington-bridge-trial-1478273769?mod=article_inline\">convicted of public-corruption charges </a>related to the closing of lanes at the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan to the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. Prosecutors said Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly closed the lanes to exact political retribution on the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse the 2013 re-election bid of Mr. Christie, a Republican.</p>\n<p>The defendants said during the trial that they believed the closed lanes were for a traffic study. Mr. Christie, who appointed Mr. Baroni to the Port Authority, was never accused of wrongdoing. Another Port Authority official, David Wildstein, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government. Mr. Wildstein, who admitted to devising the lane-closure plan, was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridgegate-architect-david-wildstein-sentenced-to-probation-1499877613?mod=article_inline\">sentenced in 2017 </a>to three years probation.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bridgegate-convictions-largely-upheld-by-appeals-court-1543335679?mod=article_inline\">most of Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly&rsquo;s convictions</a>, but tossed two civil-rights counts, for violating the travel rights of Fort Lee residents.</p>\n<p>In court documents, federal prosecutors argued for a sentence from 18 to 24 months. Prosecutors said Mr. Baroni had ignored the Fort Lee mayor&rsquo;s calls for help, had lied to a state assembly committee and had ignored problems caused by the traffic, including delayed emergency vehicles and children trying to get to school.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Defendant William E. Baroni, Jr. abused his power, defrauded a public agency, harmed ordinary citizens, and committed perjury,&rdquo; prosecutors wrote.</p>\n<p>Lawyers for Mr. Baroni, who has been out on bail, asked for a six-month sentence, followed by home confinement and community service. In a letter to Judge Wigenton, he said he regretted decisions he made during the lane closures, including ignoring the calls of the mayor of Fort Lee. He said he had made those decisions to promote Mr. Christie&rsquo;s political ambitions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What I did was wrong,&rdquo; Mr. Baroni wrote in the letter. &ldquo;I hurt thousands of people whom I&rsquo;ve never met and punishment is deserved.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to imposing the prison term, Judge Wigenton required Mr. Baroni serve one year supervised release, do 500 hours of community service and pay about $22,000 in restitution and fines.</p>\n<p>Ms. Kelly, whom the judge had initially sentenced to 18 months, hasn&rsquo;t yet been resentenced. Her lawyer said in a letter earlier this month that she intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Corinne Ramey at <a href=\"mailto:Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com\">Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton had previously sentenced onetime Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni, 47 years old, to two years in prison. She sentenced Mr. Baroni a second time Tuesday because a federal appeals court tossed a portion of his 2016 conviction.\nAfter a jury trial, Mr. Baroni and Bridget Kelly, a former aide to ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were convicted of public-corruption charges related to the closing of lanes at the George Washington Bridge, which connects Manhattan to the borough of Fort Lee, N.J. Prosecutors said Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly closed the lanes to exact political retribution on the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse the 2013 re-election bid of Mr. Christie, a Republican.\nThe defendants said during the trial that they believed the closed lanes were for a traffic study. Mr. Christie, who appointed Mr. Baroni to the Port Authority, was never accused of wrongdoing. Another Port Authority official, David Wildstein, pleaded guilty and cooperated with the government. Mr. Wildstein, who admitted to devising the lane-closure plan, was sentenced in 2017 to three years probation.\nLast year, the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld most of Mr. Baroni and Ms. Kelly\u2019s convictions, but tossed two civil-rights counts, for violating the travel rights of Fort Lee residents.\nIn court documents, federal prosecutors argued for a sentence from 18 to 24 months. Prosecutors said Mr. Baroni had ignored the Fort Lee mayor\u2019s calls for help, had lied to a state assembly committee and had ignored problems caused by the traffic, including delayed emergency vehicles and children trying to get to school.\n\u201cDefendant William E. Baroni, Jr. abused his power, defrauded a public agency, harmed ordinary citizens, and committed perjury,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nLawyers for Mr. Baroni, who has been out on bail, asked for a six-month sentence, followed by home confinement and community service. In a letter to Judge Wigenton, he said he regretted decisions he made during the lane closures, including ignoring the calls of the mayor of Fort Lee. He said he had made those decisions to promote Mr. Christie\u2019s political ambitions.\n\u201cWhat I did was wrong,\u201d Mr. Baroni wrote in the letter. \u201cI hurt thousands of people whom I\u2019ve never met and punishment is deserved.\u201d\nIn addition to imposing the prison term, Judge Wigenton required Mr. Baroni serve one year supervised release, do 500 hours of community service and pay about $22,000 in restitution and fines.\nMs. Kelly, whom the judge had initially sentenced to 18 months, hasn\u2019t yet been resentenced. Her lawyer said in a letter earlier this month that she intended to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.\nRelated\nWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com",

While the agencies have sent some documents, the Democrats said, the administration hasn&rsquo;t fulfilled the requests of the committee, which is asking for specific information about each child separated from a parent or guardian at the border.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I did not make this decision lightly,&rdquo; said committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) at Tuesday&rsquo;s meeting. &ldquo;When our own government rips vulnerable children, toddlers, and even infants from the arms of their mothers and fathers with no plan to reunite them, that is government-sponsored child abuse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>All Democratic lawmakers on the panel voted for the subpoenas, along with two Republicans, Reps. Chip Roy of Texas and Justin Amash of Michigan. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the panel, said the decision was hasty.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your decision will disincentivize entities from providing documents on a voluntary basis,&rdquo; Mr. Jordan said to Mr. Cummings. &ldquo;They will just wait now for the inevitable subpoena.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for HHS said the agency had communicated &ldquo;regularly and in good faith&rdquo; with the committee and had already supplied 792 pages of documents related to its request.</p>\n<p>At DHS, a spokesman called the vote unnecessary and a political stunt. He said the department had already submitted more than 2,600 pages in response to the committee&rsquo;s request.</p>\n<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman said that the department had documents on the subject only because it was representing DHS and HHS in litigation, and that it believed only those agencies should turn over the documents to the House.</p>\n<p>Democrats have said they would use their new control of the House of Representatives to re-examine the zero-tolerance policy that resulted in the separation last year of thousands of children from the adults with whom they arrived at the southern border, before the Trump administration declared it was reversing course.</p>\n<p>At a House Judiciary Committee hearing also on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers questioned top officials from the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Justice Department and HHS over the implementation of the policy, including which officials were aware of it and the preparations they made.Democrats described the policy as &ldquo;barbaric,&rdquo; &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; and undermining the U.S.&rsquo;s &ldquo;moral standing in the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lawmakers and officials also sparred over allegations of sexual assault against immigrant minors while in government custody. Rep. Ted Deutch (D., Fla.) said that documents from HHS and the Justice Department indicated more than 1,000 allegations reported in each of the past two years.</p>\n<p>Jonathan White, a commander in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps who was testifying about the administration&rsquo;s care for unaccompanied children and reunification efforts, said that Mr. Deutch was incorrect to accuse HHS employees, rather than contractor staff, of committing abuse.</p>\n<p>Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida asked Mr. White whether immigrants were more likely to suffer sexual assault on the journey to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Mr. White said that the route was more dangerous but that any instance of assault on people in U.S. government custody was too many.</p>\n<p>The zero-tolerance policy was implemented last year in response to a surge of largely Central American immigrants fleeing gang violence at home who crossed the border and sought asylum in the U.S. Under the policy, anyone caught crossing the border illegally would be criminally prosecuted. Because laws forbade children from being kept in jail, they were separated. Previous practice had generally been to release adults with children into the U.S. together while their cases were adjudicated.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump stopped the zero-tolerance policy <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-orders-immigrant-families-reunited-within-30-days-1530074079?mod=article_inline\">after a public outcry</a>, but confusion has continued. Last month, officials at the HHS inspector general&rsquo;s office said that the federal systems tracking children who arrived with adults were inadequate and informal, and that the policy appeared to have been in place before and after the period generally known. As a result, the inspector general said, the number of children taken into custody by HHS and subsequently released is likely <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/thousands-more-children-separated-from-parents-by-u-s-authorities-than-generally-known-watchdog-says-11547742532?mod=article_inline\">thousands more than the 2,700 figure </a>released at the time, and the total will likely never be known.</p>\n<p>Since the policy ended, the Trump administration has sought to detain families together while they wait to appear in court.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Natalie Andrews at <a href=\"mailto:Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com\">Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com</a> and Louise Radnofsky at <a href=\"mailto:louise.radnofsky@wsj.com\">louise.radnofsky@wsj.com</a></p>",

He said the department had already submitted more than 2,600 pages in response to the committee\u2019s request.\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said that the department had documents on the subject only because it was representing DHS and HHS in litigation, and that it believed only those agencies should turn over the documents to the House.\nDemocrats have said they would use their new control of the House of Representatives to re-examine the zero-tolerance policy that resulted in the separation last year of thousands of children from the adults with whom they arrived at the southern border, before the Trump administration declared it was reversing course.\nAt a House Judiciary Committee hearing also on Tuesday, Democratic lawmakers questioned top officials from the U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Justice Department and HHS over the implementation of the policy, including which officials were aware of it and the preparations they made.Democrats described the policy as \u201cbarbaric,\u201d \u201cscandalous\u201d and undermining the U.S.\u2019s \u201cmoral standing in the world.\u201d\nLawmakers and officials also sparred over allegations of sexual assault against immigrant minors while in government custody. Rep. Ted Deutch (D., Fla.) said that documents from HHS and the Justice Department indicated more than 1,000 allegations reported in each of the past two years.\nJonathan White, a commander in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps who was testifying about the administration\u2019s care for unaccompanied children and reunification efforts, said that Mr. Deutch was incorrect to accuse HHS employees, rather than contractor staff, of committing abuse.\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida asked Mr. White whether immigrants were more likely to suffer sexual assault on the journey to the U.S.\nMr. White said that the route was more dangerous but that any instance of assault on people in U.S. government custody was too many.\nThe zero-tolerance policy was implemented last year in response to a surge of largely Central American immigrants fleeing gang violence at home who crossed the border and sought asylum in the U.S. Under the policy, anyone caught crossing the border illegally would be criminally prosecuted. Because laws forbade children from being kept in jail, they were separated. Previous practice had generally been to release adults with children into the U.S. together while their cases were adjudicated.\nMr. Trump stopped the zero-tolerance policy after a public outcry, but confusion has continued. Last month, officials at the HHS inspector general\u2019s office said that the federal systems tracking children who arrived with adults were inadequate and informal, and that the policy appeared to have been in place before and after the period generally known. As a result, the inspector general said, the number of children taken into custody by HHS and subsequently released is likely thousands more than the 2,700 figure released at the time, and the total will likely never be known.\nSince the policy ended, the Trump administration has sought to detain families together while they wait to appear in court.\nWrite to Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com",

                "html": "<p>The House measure was the first of its kind to pass since lawmakers in 1976 wrote the National Emergencies Act, which allows Congress to terminate an emergency declaration. The law also limits an emergency to 180 days unless the president renews it. The measure cleared by a vote of 245-182, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-set-to-declare-national-emergency-at-border-sign-legislation-to-fund-government-11550241799?mod=article_inline\">declared a national emergency</a> over the southern border after Congress passed a spending bill that appropriates $1.38 billion for 55 miles of barriers&mdash;significantly less than the $5.7 billion he had demanded. Dissatisfied with the lower figure, the president said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/funding-and-location-of-wall-likely-to-spark-conflicts-11550276453?mod=article_inline\">he would pull together $6.7 billion</a> from the military and other sources, saying it was needed to properly secure the border.</p>\n<p>Democrats said their effort to block the president was about upholding the checks and balances in the Constitution, which bestows upon Congress the power of the purse.</p>\n<figure>An error occurred. Please try again later.<figcaption> President Trump has declared a national emergency to fund a barrier at the border with Mexico. But what constitutes a national emergency and how will the funding work? Jason Bellini reports. Photo: Getty </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Our founders had great vision. They didn&rsquo;t want a king,&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Tuesday. &ldquo;They put forth a Constitution, the heart and soul of which is the separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A White House spokesman, Judd Deere, reiterated the administration view that the president has the authority to declare a national emergency.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While Democrats continue to put American and immigrant lives in danger by willfully ignoring the horrific crisis at our border,&rdquo; Mr. Deere said in a statement, &ldquo;the president swore a Constitutional oath to protect the American people and he will use his full legal authority to do it &mdash; which, in this case, includes declaring a National Emergency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The statement didn&rsquo;t address a number of Republicans also having expressed concerns over the president sidestepping Congress.</p>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>Republicans in the Senate said they sympathize with Mr. Trump&rsquo;s desire for more money for a border wall and view migrants who enter the U.S. illegally as a legitimate concern. But many disapprove of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s declaring a national emergency as a means to address it.</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans said that Vice President Mike Pence and a Justice Department lawyer mounted a vigorous case at a closed-door lunch Tuesday about the statutory basis for Mr. Trump&rsquo;s declaration. But many Republicans left the lunch still undecided over how they would vote on the House resolution.</p>\n<p>Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said, twice, that he wasn&rsquo;t sure how the chamber would vote on the measure. Asked by a reporter if he was encouraging Republicans to vote against the House measure, Mr. McConnell responded: &ldquo;I personally couldn&rsquo;t handicap the outcome at this point.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though several Senate Republicans have yet to say how they will vote, many are wavering, citing concerns ranging from a desire for separation of powers to whether it was wise to siphon funding away from the military.</p>\n<p>Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina have committed to support the House bill. If just one more Republican adds support along with all 47 Senate Democrats, the resolution would pass the Senate by a simple majority.</p>\n<p>Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) sought to dismiss concerns that the military would lose out on funding because of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s national emergency, arguing Congress would find another way to keep military construction projects funded. But it wasn&rsquo;t clear where Republicans would find such funds, or whether Democrats would agree.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s military construction projects, we&rsquo;ll backfill that so fast,&rdquo; Mr. Shelby said. &ldquo;I predict there&rsquo;d be no trouble in the appropriations committee to backfill, make sure there&rsquo;s no cut&mdash;ultimate cut&mdash;in military construction.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Asked where the funds would come from to backfill military funding, Mr. Shelby responded: &ldquo;From money. Where do we fill everything else?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans are also worried Mr. Trump was setting a dangerous precedent. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/02/25/i-support-trumps-vision-border-security-i-would-vote-against-emergency/?utm_term=.16ba045ddead&mod=article_inline\">Mr. Tillis wrote in a Washington Post opinion article </a>on Monday: &ldquo;Republicans need to realize that this will lead inevitably to regret when a Democrat once again controls the White House, cites the precedent set by Trump, and declares his or her own national emergency to advance a policy that couldn&rsquo;t gain congressional approval.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Air Force Gen. Terrence O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the military response to the national emergency, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee as lawmakers were gearing up for the vote in the House. Gen O&rsquo;Shaughnessy refused to say whether he considered border security a national emergency or what his recommendations were to the president.</p>\n<p>But when asked what he considered the biggest national-security risk to North America, he said Russia, not the border.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=1260&size=custom_2560x1440\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=620&size=custom_2560x1440\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=140&size=custom_2560x1440 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=540&size=custom_2560x1440 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=620&size=custom_2560x1440 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=700&size=custom_2560x1440 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=860&size=custom_2560x1440 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-56374?width=1260&size=custom_2560x1440 1260w\"></img> <figcaption>   Photo:  C-SPAN  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Democrats have long cast doubt that there is an emergency on the border, recently citing Mr. Trump&rsquo;s own words in the Rose Garden earlier this month, when he said he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have to do this.&rdquo; Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday: &ldquo;An emergency by definition is something you need to do.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said he was &ldquo;leaning no&rdquo; on the resolution, citing Border Patrol agents&rsquo; reports of drugs crossing the border. &ldquo;The No. 1 responsibility of the federal government is to protect the American people,&rdquo; Mr. Grassley added.</p>\n<p>Overriding a veto by Mr. Trump would be a tall order, as it requires supermajorities in each chamber. It would likely require about 289 votes in the House, meaning many Republicans would have to join with the chamber&rsquo;s 235 Democrats. In the Senate, overturning a veto would require 67 votes if all 100 senators were present and voting. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Mr. Shelby, the Senate Appropriations chairman, said he didn&rsquo;t think the Senate could muster the votes to override a veto. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;d be hard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Natalie Andrews, Nancy A.

                "text": "The House measure was the first of its kind to pass since lawmakers in 1976 wrote the National Emergencies Act, which allows Congress to terminate an emergency declaration. The law also limits an emergency to 180 days unless the president renews it. The measure cleared by a vote of 245-182, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats.\nMr. Trump recently declared a national emergency over the southern border after Congress passed a spending bill that appropriates $1.38 billion for 55 miles of barriers\u2014significantly less than the $5.7 billion he had demanded. Dissatisfied with the lower figure, the president said he would pull together $6.7 billion from the military and other sources, saying it was needed to properly secure the border.\nDemocrats said their effort to block the president was about upholding the checks and balances in the Constitution, which bestows upon Congress the power of the purse.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\n\u201cOur founders had great vision. They didn\u2019t want a king,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Tuesday. \u201cThey put forth a Constitution, the heart and soul of which is the separation of powers.\u201d\nA White House spokesman, Judd Deere, reiterated the administration view that the president has the authority to declare a national emergency.\n\u201cWhile Democrats continue to put American and immigrant lives in danger by willfully ignoring the horrific crisis at our border,\u201d Mr. Deere said in a statement, \u201cthe president swore a Constitutional oath to protect the American people and he will use his full legal authority to do it \u2014 which, in this case, includes declaring a National Emergency.\u201d\nThe statement didn\u2019t address a number of Republicans also having expressed concerns over the president sidestepping Congress.\nRelated Coverage\nRepublicans in the Senate said they sympathize with Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for more money for a border wall and view migrants who enter the U.S. illegally as a legitimate concern. But many disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s declaring a national emergency as a means to address it.\nSenate Republicans said that Vice President Mike Pence and a Justice Department lawyer mounted a vigorous case at a closed-door lunch Tuesday about the statutory basis for Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration. But many Republicans left the lunch still undecided over how they would vote on the House resolution.\nEven Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said, twice, that he wasn\u2019t sure how the chamber would vote on the measure. Asked by a reporter if he was encouraging Republicans to vote against the House measure, Mr. McConnell responded: \u201cI personally couldn\u2019t handicap the outcome at this point.\u201d\nThough several Senate Republicans have yet to say how they will vote, many are wavering, citing concerns ranging from a desire for separation of powers to whether it was wise to siphon funding away from the military.\nRepublican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Thom Tillis of North Carolina have committed to support the House bill. If just one more Republican adds support along with all 47 Senate Democrats, the resolution would pass the Senate by a simple majority.\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) sought to dismiss concerns that the military would lose out on funding because of Mr. Trump\u2019s national emergency, arguing Congress would find another way to keep military construction projects funded. But it wasn\u2019t clear where Republicans would find such funds, or whether Democrats would agree.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s military construction projects, we\u2019ll backfill that so fast,\u201d Mr. Shelby said. \u201cI predict there\u2019d be no trouble in the appropriations committee to backfill, make sure there\u2019s no cut\u2014ultimate cut\u2014in military construction.\u201d\nAsked where the funds would come from to backfill military funding, Mr. Shelby responded: \u201cFrom money. Where do we fill everything else?\u201d\nSenate Republicans are also worried Mr. Trump was setting a dangerous precedent. Mr. Tillis wrote in a Washington Post opinion article on Monday: \u201cRepublicans need to realize that this will lead inevitably to regret when a Democrat once again controls the White House, cites the precedent set by Trump, and declares his or her own national emergency to advance a policy that couldn\u2019t gain congressional approval.\u201d\nAir Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, the commander of U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the military response to the national emergency, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee as lawmakers were gearing up for the vote in the House. Gen O\u2019Shaughnessy refused to say whether he considered border security a national emergency or what his recommendations were to the president.\nBut when asked what he considered the biggest national-security risk to North America, he said Russia, not the border.\nDemocrats have long cast doubt that there is an emergency on the border, recently citing Mr. Trump\u2019s own words in the Rose Garden earlier this month, when he said he \u201cdidn\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Tuesday: \u201cAn emergency by definition is something you need to do.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign-up\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said he was \u201cleaning no\u201d on the resolution, citing Border Patrol agents\u2019 reports of drugs crossing the border. \u201cThe No. 1 responsibility of the federal government is to protect the American people,\u201d Mr. Grassley added.\nOverriding a veto by Mr. Trump would be a tall order, as it requires supermajorities in each chamber. It would likely require about 289 votes in the House, meaning many Republicans would have to join with the chamber\u2019s 235 Democrats. In the Senate, overturning a veto would require 67 votes if all 100 senators were present and voting. Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate.\nMr. Shelby, the Senate Appropriations chairman, said he didn\u2019t think the Senate could muster the votes to override a veto. \u201cI think it\u2019d be hard.\u201d\n\u2014Natalie Andrews, Nancy A.

                "html": "<p>&ldquo;They want the remedy to work in the future, that is why they might have to address that language,&rdquo; said Andrew Vollmer, a law professor at the University of Virginia. &ldquo;I hope both will be trying to find a standard of conduct that Musk feels he can meet and that the SEC deems to be sufficiently protective of the market.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.</p>\n<h4>Share Your Thoughts</h4>\n<p><em>What government restrictions, if any, are appropriate for guiding how a chief executive communicates with investors and the public through social media and other modern communications? Join the conversation below.</em></p>\n<p>Under the settlement, Mr. Musk needed permission from company lawyers for tweets and other communications that could affect buying and selling of the auto maker&rsquo;s stock. The SEC filed a contempt motion after Mr. Musk tweeted without permission in mid-February about expected vehicle deliveries. He hours later corrected the tweet with the help of a lawyer, prompting the SEC to initiate the contempt-of-court proceedings.</p>\n<p>The SEC alleged he &ldquo;blew past&rdquo; the requirements in other instances. Mr. Musk has maintained his Feb. 16 tweet and others didn&rsquo;t violate the terms of his settlement.</p>\n<p>Rather than rule on the contempt request, Judge Alison Nathan at a hearing this month ordered the two sides to engage in a new round of talks. In particular, she said she found the preapproval language hard to pin down.</p>\n<p>Legal experts say judges and other observers should be concerned with a bigger problem: a government-imposed standard so broad it could restrict free speech.</p>\n<figure>  <h4> From the Archives </h4>  An error occurred. Please try again later.<figcaption> Securities regulators are suing Elon Musk for fraud and seeking to remove him from Tesla Inc. WSJ&rsquo;s Tim Higgins explains. Photo: AP (Originally published Sept. 28, 2018)) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;The original settlement is a dangerous precedent&mdash;having the U.S. government order an individual to have prospective public statements reviewed in advance and be subject to disapproval,&rdquo; said Mr. Vollmer, who was previously the SEC&rsquo;s deputy general counsel.</p>\n<p>Mr. Musk has at times sometimes <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-gives-musk-until-march-11-to-answer-contempt-claims-11551200381?mod=article_inline\">provoked the regulator</a>. He has accused the SEC of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1047943670350020608?lang=en&mod=article_inline\">taking the side of short sellers</a>. After the SEC accused him of violating his settlement, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1100371207491248128?mod=article_inline\">suggested its oversight was &ldquo;broken.&rdquo;</a> The tweet has since been deleted.</p>\n<p>Others say the policy was narrow enough to address problems with Mr. Musk&rsquo;s use of <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/TWTR\">Twitter</a>. &ldquo;Those steps were crucial to the settlement&mdash;the idea we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from occurring,&rdquo; said Robert Jackson, a Democratic SEC commissioner.</p>\n<p>Information is material if it likely would affect an investment decision, and has been defined by U.S. Supreme Court case law. But the words &ldquo;reasonably could contain&rdquo; appears to be novel.</p>\n<p>The SEC says the extra words make the standard broader than materiality, because the agency wanted Mr. Musk to be cautious about seeking preapproval. Cheryl Crumpton, the SEC lawyer arguing before Judge Nathan, said it was probably the first time the SEC had ever used the language in an enforcement order.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p>Ms. Crumpton said the only tweets exempt from the oversight policy would be statements that are &ldquo;obviously immaterial,&rdquo; such as interactions Mr. Musk has on Twitter with individual Tesla owners about their cars.</p>\n<p>Mr. Musk&rsquo;s lawyers say the wording is too vague to be the basis for any contempt finding, and make it hard for the Tesla CEO and his executive staff to interpret how to comply on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>For Mr. Musk, the court&rsquo;s focus on the policy&rsquo;s ambiguity is a win. As long as he and the SEC can resolve their latest dispute, Judge Nathan won&rsquo;t need to rule on whether he should be held in contempt for violating the 2018 order.</p>\n<p>Mr. Musk and Tesla have been feuding with the SEC <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-twitter-account-am-considering-taking-tesla-private-at-420-1533661152?mod=article_inline.&mod=article_inline\">since the auto executive tweeted in August that he might take the company private</a> and had &ldquo;funding secured&rdquo; to do so. In September, Mr. Musk agreed to settle the SEC&rsquo;s enforcement investigation over the tweet, agreed to pay a $20 million fine and relinquish his chairman title. He also agreed to the policy of having company officials oversee and preapprove certain tweets.</p>\n<p>The SEC&rsquo;s enforcement cases rarely involve forcing companies to undertake such particular corporate-governance steps. In another unusual example, the SEC last year <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-charges-theranos-and-founder-elizabeth-holmes-with-fraud-1521045648?mod=article_inline\">obtained a settlement with Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes</a> that stripped her of voting control over the company.</p>\n<p>The agency can seek to bar an executive from running a public company. But in Tesla&rsquo;s case, that was thought to be bad medicine, because shareholders would suffer if the company collapsed without Mr. Musk&rsquo;s vision and leadership steering it.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Dave Michaels at <a href=\"mailto:dave.michaels@wsj.com\">dave.michaels@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "\u201cThey want the remedy to work in the future, that is why they might have to address that language,\u201d said Andrew Vollmer, a law professor at the University of Virginia. \u201cI hope both will be trying to find a standard of conduct that Musk feels he can meet and that the SEC deems to be sufficiently protective of the market.\u201d\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment on the negotiations. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment.\nShare Your Thoughts\nWhat government restrictions, if any, are appropriate for guiding how a chief executive communicates with investors and the public through social media and other modern communications? Join the conversation below.\nUnder the settlement, Mr. Musk needed permission from company lawyers for tweets and other communications that could affect buying and selling of the auto maker\u2019s stock. The SEC filed a contempt motion after Mr. Musk tweeted without permission in mid-February about expected vehicle deliveries. He hours later corrected the tweet with the help of a lawyer, prompting the SEC to initiate the contempt-of-court proceedings.\nThe SEC alleged he \u201cblew past\u201d the requirements in other instances. Mr. Musk has maintained his Feb. 16 tweet and others didn\u2019t violate the terms of his settlement.\nRather than rule on the contempt request, Judge Alison Nathan at a hearing this month ordered the two sides to engage in a new round of talks. In particular, she said she found the preapproval language hard to pin down.\nLegal experts say judges and other observers should be concerned with a bigger problem: a government-imposed standard so broad it could restrict free speech.\nFrom the Archives\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\n\u201cThe original settlement is a dangerous precedent\u2014having the U.S. government order an individual to have prospective public statements reviewed in advance and be subject to disapproval,\u201d said Mr. Vollmer, who was previously the SEC\u2019s deputy general counsel.\nMr. Musk has at times sometimes provoked the regulator. He has accused the SEC of taking the side of short sellers. After the SEC accused him of violating his settlement, he suggested its oversight was \u201cbroken.\u201d The tweet has since been deleted.\nOthers say the policy was narrow enough to address problems with Mr. Musk\u2019s use of Twitter. \u201cThose steps were crucial to the settlement\u2014the idea we would have future oversight to prevent future problems from occurring,\u201d said Robert Jackson, a Democratic SEC commissioner.\nInformation is material if it likely would affect an investment decision, and has been defined by U.S. Supreme Court case law. But the words \u201creasonably could contain\u201d appears to be novel.\nThe SEC says the extra words make the standard broader than materiality, because the agency wanted Mr. Musk to be cautious about seeking preapproval. Cheryl Crumpton, the SEC lawyer arguing before Judge Nathan, said it was probably the first time the SEC had ever used the language in an enforcement order.\nRelated\nMs. Crumpton said the only tweets exempt from the oversight policy would be statements that are \u201cobviously immaterial,\u201d such as interactions Mr. Musk has on Twitter with individual Tesla owners about their cars.\nMr. Musk\u2019s lawyers say the wording is too vague to be the basis for any contempt finding, and make it hard for the Tesla CEO and his executive staff to interpret how to comply on a day-to-day basis.\nFor Mr. Musk, the court\u2019s focus on the policy\u2019s ambiguity is a win. As long as he and the SEC can resolve their latest dispute, Judge Nathan won\u2019t need to rule on whether he should be held in contempt for violating the 2018 order.\nMr. Musk and Tesla have been feuding with the SEC since the auto executive tweeted in August that he might take the company private and had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to do so. In September, Mr. Musk agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s enforcement investigation over the tweet, agreed to pay a $20 million fine and relinquish his chairman title. He also agreed to the policy of having company officials oversee and preapprove certain tweets.\nThe SEC\u2019s enforcement cases rarely involve forcing companies to undertake such particular corporate-governance steps. In another unusual example, the SEC last year obtained a settlement with Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes that stripped her of voting control over the company.\nThe agency can seek to bar an executive from running a public company. But in Tesla\u2019s case, that was thought to be bad medicine, because shareholders would suffer if the company collapsed without Mr. Musk\u2019s vision and leadership steering it.\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com",

                "html": "<p>In July 2017, Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s office obtained a search warrant for the personal email account of President Trump&rsquo;s former personal lawyer. The special counsel&rsquo;s early interest in Mr. Cohen, according to the documents, focused on Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s consulting work for foreign entities and on his personal finances.</p>\n<p>The documents also show that Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s office handed parts of the Cohen investigation in February 2018 to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who ultimately secured evidence of campaign-finance violations stemming from illegal hush-money payments Mr. Cohen arranged to two women during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen and federal prosecutors have since <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601?mod=article_inline\">implicated President Trump</a> in those crimes.</p>\n<p>In January 2018, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-arranged-130-000-payment-for-adult-film-stars-silence-1515787678?mod=ig_michaelcohen&mod=article_inline\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> that Mr. Cohen had arranged a $130,000 payment to a former adult-film star, Stephanie Clifford, to suppress her account of a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Trump has denied any such encounter with Ms. Clifford, who is known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and has denied wrongdoing in the campaign-finance case.</p>\n<p>Hundreds of pages of investigative records were made public on Tuesday after a federal judge granted a request by news organizations, including the publisher of the Journal, to unseal copies of the warrants and supporting documents behind <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-raids-trump-lawyers-office-1523306297?mod=article_inline\">the April 2018 search</a> by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s home, hotel room and office.</p>\n<p>The documents showed investigators had sought historical cellphone location data for Mr. Cohen before the April 2018 raid, including for the month leading up to the 2016 presidential election. They also revealed the FBI searched a fourth location&mdash;a TD Bank branch in New York that contained a safe-deposit box owned by Mr. Cohen and his wife.</p>\n<p>The unsealed materials shed more light on how the Cohen investigation unfolded. By late 2017, after several search warrants had been executed on the lawyer&rsquo;s email accounts, Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s office was investigating Mr. Cohen for a range of possible crimes, including bank fraud, money laundering and foreign-lobbying violations, the documents showed.</p>\n<p>Parts of the investigation related to possible bank fraud were referred to the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office in Manhattan in early February 2018. During the ensuing investigation, the FBI and Manhattan prosecutors &ldquo;obtained evidence that Mr. Cohen also committed a criminal violation of campaign finance laws,&rdquo; according to an April 2018 search-warrant application unsealed Tuesday.</p>\n<figure>An error occurred.

Prosecutors later said in a court document that Mr. Cohen &ldquo;acted in coordination with and at the direction of&rdquo; Mr. Trump in arranging the payments.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen, who also pleaded guilty to tax evasion as well as making false statements to banks and to Congress, is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in May.</p>\n<p>Manhattan federal prosecutors were allowed to redact parts of Tuesday&rsquo;s documents that dealt with campaign-finance crimes, after the government told a federal judge they related to a continuing investigation.</p>\n<p>Before prosecutors could view the documents seized in the raid, a third party appointed by a federal judge, with input from lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, reviewed the materials to determine which documents were protected by attorney-client privilege and shouldn&rsquo;t be used in the government&rsquo;s investigation.</p>\n<p>One reason the raid was necessary, investigators said, was that they hadn&rsquo;t been able to obtain the contents of Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s Trump Organization email account. Investigators also wanted to access a phone Mr. Cohen possessed with encrypted communications apps, including WhatsApp, Signal and Dust.</p>\n<h4>Further Reading</h4>\n<p>The documents released Tuesday suggest Mr. Cohen initially came under scrutiny in part because of more than $3 million he received in consulting fees from corporate clients. When Mr. Cohen opened a new checking account in the name of his consulting firm, Essential Consultants LLC, he told his bank it was a real-estate consulting company whose clients would be based in the U.S.</p>\n<p>In fact, investigators said, Mr. Cohen received &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; payments from foreign entities, including from a Kazakh bank, a South Korea-based aircraft manufacturer and an investment fund linked to a Russian oligarch. Some of these <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-paid-trump-lawyer-for-insights-on-administration-1525821278?mod=article_inline\">payments had been previously disclosed</a>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s withdrawals from the Essential Consultants account were used largely for personal purposes, investigators said, including to pay fees from the Core Club, a private social club in Manhattan.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen also used <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyer-used-private-company-pseudonyms-to-pay-porn-star-stormy-daniels-1516315731/?mod=article_inline\">Essential Consultants to send the $130,000</a> hush payment to Ms. Clifford.</p>\n<p>Tuesday&rsquo;s documents revealed new details about Mr. Cohen&rsquo;s consulting work for major corporations in the months after Mr. Trump&rsquo;s 2017 inauguration, including that <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/T\">AT&amp;T</a> Inc. hired the president&rsquo;s personal lawyer in January 2017 to consult on issues including the company&rsquo;s bid to acquire Time Warner Inc.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson has called the company&rsquo;s hiring of Mr. Cohen a &ldquo;big mistake,&rdquo; and the Justice Department told members of Congress last year that department officials had no known contact with Mr. Cohen over the merger, which had been held up by an antitrust lawsuit the Justice Department filed in November 2017. The merger closed in June of last year after a federal judge ruled it legal.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T hired Mr. Cohen to consult on net neutrality and tax reform, according to the documents.</p>\n<p>According to an FBI affidavit, another company, drugmaker Novartis AG, hired Mr. Cohen to &ldquo;gain access to relevant policy makers&rdquo; in the administration, including on efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last month that he removed from a proposed contract with Novartis language related to providing access to the government, and that he told the company he would not do lobbying work. The contract he ultimately signed with Novartis was for consulting and advisory services, according to a copy of the contract viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Corrections &amp; Amplifications </strong> <br>\n Michael Cohen signed a contract with drug company Novartis AG to provide consulting and advisory services, according to a copy of the contract viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

                "text": "In July 2017, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office obtained a search warrant for the personal email account of President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer. The special counsel\u2019s early interest in Mr. Cohen, according to the documents, focused on Mr. Cohen\u2019s consulting work for foreign entities and on his personal finances.\nThe documents also show that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office handed parts of the Cohen investigation in February 2018 to federal prosecutors in Manhattan, who ultimately secured evidence of campaign-finance violations stemming from illegal hush-money payments Mr. Cohen arranged to two women during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen and federal prosecutors have since implicated President Trump in those crimes.\nIn January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Cohen had arranged a $130,000 payment to a former adult-film star, Stephanie Clifford, to suppress her account of a sexual encounter she said she had with Mr. Trump a decade earlier. Mr. Trump has denied any such encounter with Ms. Clifford, who is known professionally as Stormy Daniels, and has denied wrongdoing in the campaign-finance case.\nHundreds of pages of investigative records were made public on Tuesday after a federal judge granted a request by news organizations, including the publisher of the Journal, to unseal copies of the warrants and supporting documents behind the April 2018 search by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of Mr. Cohen\u2019s home, hotel room and office.\nThe documents showed investigators had sought historical cellphone location data for Mr. Cohen before the April 2018 raid, including for the month leading up to the 2016 presidential election. They also revealed the FBI searched a fourth location\u2014a TD Bank branch in New York that contained a safe-deposit box owned by Mr. Cohen and his wife.\nThe unsealed materials shed more light on how the Cohen investigation unfolded. By late 2017, after several search warrants had been executed on the lawyer\u2019s email accounts, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was investigating Mr. Cohen for a range of possible crimes, including bank fraud, money laundering and foreign-lobbying violations, the documents showed.\nParts of the investigation related to possible bank fraud were referred to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan in early February 2018. During the ensuing investigation, the FBI and Manhattan prosecutors \u201cobtained evidence that Mr. Cohen also committed a criminal violation of campaign finance laws,\u201d according to an April 2018 search-warrant application unsealed Tuesday.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty in August 2018 to two campaign-finance violations connected to hush-money payments he arranged to Ms. Clifford and to a second woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also alleged an affair with Mr. Trump that he has denied. Prosecutors later said in a court document that Mr. Cohen \u201cacted in coordination with and at the direction of\u201d Mr. Trump in arranging the payments.\nMr. Cohen, who also pleaded guilty to tax evasion as well as making false statements to banks and to Congress, is expected to begin a three-year prison sentence in May.\nManhattan federal prosecutors were allowed to redact parts of Tuesday\u2019s documents that dealt with campaign-finance crimes, after the government told a federal judge they related to a continuing investigation.\nBefore prosecutors could view the documents seized in the raid, a third party appointed by a federal judge, with input from lawyers for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump, reviewed the materials to determine which documents were protected by attorney-client privilege and shouldn\u2019t be used in the government\u2019s investigation.\nOne reason the raid was necessary, investigators said, was that they hadn\u2019t been able to obtain the contents of Mr. Cohen\u2019s Trump Organization email account. Investigators also wanted to access a phone Mr. Cohen possessed with encrypted communications apps, including WhatsApp, Signal and Dust.\nFurther Reading\nThe documents released Tuesday suggest Mr. Cohen initially came under scrutiny in part because of more than $3 million he received in consulting fees from corporate clients. When Mr. Cohen opened a new checking account in the name of his consulting firm, Essential Consultants LLC, he told his bank it was a real-estate consulting company whose clients would be based in the U.S.\nIn fact, investigators said, Mr. Cohen received \u201csubstantial\u201d payments from foreign entities, including from a Kazakh bank, a South Korea-based aircraft manufacturer and an investment fund linked to a Russian oligarch. Some of these payments had been previously disclosed.\nMr. Cohen\u2019s withdrawals from the Essential Consultants account were used largely for personal purposes, investigators said, including to pay fees from the Core Club, a private social club in Manhattan.\nMr. Cohen also used Essential Consultants to send the $130,000 hush payment to Ms. Clifford.\nTuesday\u2019s documents revealed new details about Mr. Cohen\u2019s consulting work for major corporations in the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration, including that AT&T Inc. hired the president\u2019s personal lawyer in January 2017 to consult on issues including the company\u2019s bid to acquire Time Warner Inc.\nAT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson has called the company\u2019s hiring of Mr. Cohen a \u201cbig mistake,\u201d and the Justice Department told members of Congress last year that department officials had no known contact with Mr. Cohen over the merger, which had been held up by an antitrust lawsuit the Justice Department filed in November 2017. The merger closed in June of last year after a federal judge ruled it legal.\nAT&T hired Mr. Cohen to consult on net neutrality and tax reform, according to the documents.\nAccording to an FBI affidavit, another company, drugmaker Novartis AG, hired Mr. Cohen to \u201cgain access to relevant policy makers\u201d in the administration, including on efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\nMr. Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last month that he removed from a proposed contract with Novartis language related to providing access to the government, and that he told the company he would not do lobbying work. The contract he ultimately signed with Novartis was for consulting and advisory services, according to a copy of the contract viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nMichael Cohen signed a contract with drug company Novartis AG to provide consulting and advisory services, according to a copy of the contract viewed by The Wall Street Journal. An earlier version of the story cited a newly unsealed FBI affidavit that said Novartis hired Mr. Cohen to \u201cgain access to relevant policy makers\u201d in the Trump administration. Mr. Cohen testified before the House Oversight Committee last month that he removed from the contract language related to providing access to the government, and that he told the company he would not do lobbying work.

                "html": "<p>Senators appeared content with the Fed&rsquo;s stance: They asked Mr. Powell so few questions about interest rates during the nearly two-hour hearing that he volunteered to better define the &ldquo;patient&rdquo; policy in the final minute.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When I say we&rsquo;re going to be patient, what that really means is we&rsquo;re in no rush to make a judgment about changes in policy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to allow&hellip;the data to come in. I think we&rsquo;re in a very good place to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>Mr. Powell described the U.S. economy as healthy and the outlook as good, but he also pointed to headwinds from abroad. These include slower growth in China and Europe, political uncertainty over trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, and the discussions surrounding the U.K.&rsquo;s decision to leave the European Union.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals,&rdquo; Mr. Powell said. &ldquo;Right now, the predominant risks to our economy are slowing global growth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Financial markets turned volatile late last year and financial conditions, including stock and bond prices, &ldquo;are now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>While Fed officials seem unlikely to change rates soon, they appear much closer to announcing modifications concerning the runoff of the central bank&rsquo;s $4 trillion asset portfolio. They have indicated recently they are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-minutes-reveal-growth-risks-prompted-rate-pause-11550689273?mod=article_inline\">ready to end the runoff</a> later this year.</p>\n<p>Mr. Powell said Tuesday the Fed is preparing to evaluate the &ldquo;appropriate timing and approach for the end of the balance sheet runoff.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Officials began shrinking their crisis-era holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities in 2017 and plan to continue reducing their mortgage-bond holdings after the runoff ends, leaving primarily Treasurys.</p>\n<p>The central bank had been raising rates steadily over the past two years: With unemployment falling to half-century lows, many officials warned of the potential for the economy to expand beyond its long-run capacity, fueling more inflation.</p>\n<p>Officials have been surprised by both higher-than-anticipated levels of workforce participation, which have so far prevented steeper declines in the unemployment rate, and modest price pressures, which have held year-over-year inflation readings just below the Fed&rsquo;s 2% target in recent months.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>While recent energy-price declines are expected to hold down measures of overall inflation in the months ahead, Mr. Powell said those effects are likely to prove transitory. As those effects subside, &ldquo;we expect that inflation will run close to 2%,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Meantime, he said it appeared there was more slack, or excess capacity, in the job market because of a stabilization in workforce-participation rates, which had been projected to fall as baby boomers retire.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If people weren&rsquo;t coming back in, then the unemployment rate would be substantially lower,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they are, or they&rsquo;re staying&hellip;and that tells us there is more room to grow, and that certainly has implications for monetary policy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Powell defended <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/n-y-feds-john-williams-calls-for-reassessing-inflation-targeting-framework-11550848526?mod=article_inline\">a proposal that would redefine</a> the Fed&rsquo;s 2% inflation target to encourage periods of modestly higher inflation when the economy is strong to compensate for weaker inflation during downturns.</p>\n<p>He said the change would be evaluated as part of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-embarks-on-a-rethink-of-its-inflation-target-11551016801?mod=article_inline\">a broader review </a>the Fed is conducting of its framework this year. Policy makers are focused on ways to make their 2% inflation target &ldquo;highly credible,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>The Fed has only recently succeeded in seeing inflation rise closer to the target, and even then, expectations of future inflation have been drifting lower. &ldquo;We owe it to the public&rdquo; to think through better strategies to meet the Fed&rsquo;s goals, he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Powell also warned about rising federal borrowing, with budget deficits projected to surpass $1 trillion in the coming years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path,&rdquo; he said. He later added, &ldquo;The idea that deficits don&rsquo;t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currencies is just wrong.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Nick Timiraos at <a href=\"mailto:nick.timiraos@wsj.com\">nick.timiraos@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "Senators appeared content with the Fed\u2019s stance: They asked Mr. Powell so few questions about interest rates during the nearly two-hour hearing that he volunteered to better define the \u201cpatient\u201d policy in the final minute.\n\u201cWhen I say we\u2019re going to be patient, what that really means is we\u2019re in no rush to make a judgment about changes in policy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow\u2026the data to come in. I think we\u2019re in a very good place to do that.\u201d\nRelated Coverage\nMr. Powell described the U.S. economy as healthy and the outlook as good, but he also pointed to headwinds from abroad. These include slower growth in China and Europe, political uncertainty over trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing, and the discussions surrounding the U.K.\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\n\u201cOver the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cRight now, the predominant risks to our economy are slowing global growth.\u201d\nFinancial markets turned volatile late last year and financial conditions, including stock and bond prices, \u201care now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year,\u201d he said.\nWhile Fed officials seem unlikely to change rates soon, they appear much closer to announcing modifications concerning the runoff of the central bank\u2019s $4 trillion asset portfolio. They have indicated recently they are ready to end the runoff later this year.\nMr. Powell said Tuesday the Fed is preparing to evaluate the \u201cappropriate timing and approach for the end of the balance sheet runoff.\u201d\nOfficials began shrinking their crisis-era holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities in 2017 and plan to continue reducing their mortgage-bond holdings after the runoff ends, leaving primarily Treasurys.\nThe central bank had been raising rates steadily over the past two years: With unemployment falling to half-century lows, many officials warned of the potential for the economy to expand beyond its long-run capacity, fueling more inflation.\nOfficials have been surprised by both higher-than-anticipated levels of workforce participation, which have so far prevented steeper declines in the unemployment rate, and modest price pressures, which have held year-over-year inflation readings just below the Fed\u2019s 2% target in recent months.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nWhile recent energy-price declines are expected to hold down measures of overall inflation in the months ahead, Mr. Powell said those effects are likely to prove transitory. As those effects subside, \u201cwe expect that inflation will run close to 2%,\u201d he said.\nMeantime, he said it appeared there was more slack, or excess capacity, in the job market because of a stabilization in workforce-participation rates, which had been projected to fall as baby boomers retire.\n\u201cIf people weren\u2019t coming back in, then the unemployment rate would be substantially lower,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are, or they\u2019re staying\u2026and that tells us there is more room to grow, and that certainly has implications for monetary policy.\u201d\nMr. Powell defended a proposal that would redefine the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target to encourage periods of modestly higher inflation when the economy is strong to compensate for weaker inflation during downturns.\nHe said the change would be evaluated as part of a broader review the Fed is conducting of its framework this year. Policy makers are focused on ways to make their 2% inflation target \u201chighly credible,\u201d he said.\nThe Fed has only recently succeeded in seeing inflation rise closer to the target, and even then, expectations of future inflation have been drifting lower. \u201cWe owe it to the public\u201d to think through better strategies to meet the Fed\u2019s goals, he said.\nMr. Powell also warned about rising federal borrowing, with budget deficits projected to surpass $1 trillion in the coming years.\n\u201cIt is widely agreed that federal government debt is on an unsustainable path,\u201d he said. He later added, \u201cThe idea that deficits don\u2019t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currencies is just wrong.\u201d\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",

                "html": "<p>People tracking the negotiations said the talks appear to be in their final stages, following a rocky patch after Chinese leaders were unnerved by President Trump&rsquo;s decision to abruptly break off nuclear-disarmament talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.</p>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the endgame,&rdquo; said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p>If the two sides continue to make progress, he said, they should be able to finish a trade deal by the end of April&mdash;or about one month later than previously expected.</p>\n<p>The two sides are aiming for a package deal that includes substantial increases in U.S. exports to China, and Chinese pledges to boost protection of intellectual property, end pressure on U.S. companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partners and reduce subsidies for Chinese firms.</p>\n<p>But the two sides still have important issues to resolve including how to enforce a deal and the pace at which the U.S. and China will roll back the tariffs imposed over the past year. The U.S. has levied tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, covering about half the value of Chinese exports to the U.S. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, about 90% of U.S. exports to China.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-in-no-rush-to-make-trade-deal-with-china-11552505809?mod=article_inline\">vowed last week</a> to walk away from a deal he considered insufficient. But behind the scenes, the president has been pressing Mr. Lighthizer to finish a deal, people familiar with the discussions said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When can you get a deal done?&rdquo; Mr. Trump asked the trade representative in a March 12 exchange, these people said. &ldquo;Two or three weeks,&rdquo; Mr. Lighthizer replied. Earlier in the day, Mr. Lighthizer had told the Senate Finance Committee, &ldquo;Our hope is we are in the final weeks of an agreement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A deal also appeared to be at hand late in February. U.S. negotiators were optimistic that a pact could be sealed at a summit between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mr. Trump&rsquo;s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida by the end of March.</p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-china-trade-deal-isnt-imminent-ambassador-branstad-says-11552031163?mod=article_inline\">timetable unraveled</a> after Chinese negotiators saw red flags in the failed Hanoi summit between Messrs. Trump and Kim. They feared Mr. Trump could press their leader with take-it-or-leave it demands at Mar-a-Lago, and concluded that a deal should be locked down before the two leaders met face to face.</p>\n<p>In addition, the two sides have been negotiating the text in English, creating a delay as language had to be translated into Chinese. Mr. Liu also had limited authority, forcing him to seek approval of deal provisions from Mr. Xi and other senior Communist party officials, those following the talks said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There should have been an agreed-upon Chinese text before Liu He left Washington&rdquo; in the last round of talks in late February, said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who consults with the White House on trade.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>Negotiators for China and the U.S. are still working to resolve one of the most stubborn sticking points: how to ensure China makes good on its promises to ease burdens on U.S. companies operating in China.</p>\n<p>Mr. Lighthizer has sketched out key provisions in Congressional testimony, describing a protocol in which the two sides would hold consultations on disputes, starting with lower-level officials. If those officials didn&rsquo;t resolve the problem, Messrs. Lighthizer and Liu would get involved. If no agreement is reached, the U.S. could impose tariffs, Mr. Lighthizer has said.</p>\n<p>But he hasn&rsquo;t publicly discussed another U.S. priority&mdash;that China agree not to retaliate against U.S. tariffs imposed for violations of the pact, at least in some circumstances. Beijing hasn&rsquo;t approved that request.</p>\n<p>Another big issue is the pace at which the two sides would remove tariffs now in force. The U.S. wants to roll them back slowly, after China reaches certain milestones. Beijing wants the tariffs quickly lifted.</p>\n<p>U.S. negotiators have divided the tariffs into two kinds. They are more willing to roll back the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-lay-out-line-on-china-trade-1537213209?mod=article_inline\">10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods</a>, which took effect in September as the U.S. tried to put more pressure on China&mdash;or at least some of those levies..</p>\n<p>But they want to keep in place the 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods levied, in two stages, in July and August. Those tariffs was meant to compensate the U.S. for what the White House calculated was the harm to U.S. companies caused by China&rsquo;s forced technology transfers.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is also pressing China to ease its restrictions on cross-border data flows, people familiar with the negotiations said. Those talks include permitting U.S. companies to set up cloud computing operations in China and market their services there, rather than being limited to licensing technology to Chinese firms. Negotiations on those subjects are moving slowly, the people involved said.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Bob Davis at <a href=\"mailto:bob.davis@wsj.com\">bob.davis@wsj.com</a></p>\n<p>Appeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'China, U.S. Set For Next Round Of Talks.'</p>",

                "text": "People tracking the negotiations said the talks appear to be in their final stages, following a rocky patch after Chinese leaders were unnerved by President Trump\u2019s decision to abruptly break off nuclear-disarmament talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in February.\nRelated Coverage\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the endgame,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nIf the two sides continue to make progress, he said, they should be able to finish a trade deal by the end of April\u2014or about one month later than previously expected.\nThe two sides are aiming for a package deal that includes substantial increases in U.S. exports to China, and Chinese pledges to boost protection of intellectual property, end pressure on U.S. companies to transfer technology to their Chinese partners and reduce subsidies for Chinese firms.\nBut the two sides still have important issues to resolve including how to enforce a deal and the pace at which the U.S. and China will roll back the tariffs imposed over the past year. The U.S. has levied tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, covering about half the value of Chinese exports to the U.S. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, about 90% of U.S. exports to China.\nMr. Trump vowed last week to walk away from a deal he considered insufficient. But behind the scenes, the president has been pressing Mr. Lighthizer to finish a deal, people familiar with the discussions said.\n\u201cWhen can you get a deal done?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the trade representative in a March 12 exchange, these people said. \u201cTwo or three weeks,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer replied. Earlier in the day, Mr. Lighthizer had told the Senate Finance Committee, \u201cOur hope is we are in the final weeks of an agreement.\u201d\nA deal also appeared to be at hand late in February. U.S. negotiators were optimistic that a pact could be sealed at a summit between Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida by the end of March.\nThat timetable unraveled after Chinese negotiators saw red flags in the failed Hanoi summit between Messrs. Trump and Kim. They feared Mr. Trump could press their leader with take-it-or-leave it demands at Mar-a-Lago, and concluded that a deal should be locked down before the two leaders met face to face.\nIn addition, the two sides have been negotiating the text in English, creating a delay as language had to be translated into Chinese. Mr. Liu also had limited authority, forcing him to seek approval of deal provisions from Mr. Xi and other senior Communist party officials, those following the talks said.\n\u201cThere should have been an agreed-upon Chinese text before Liu He left Washington\u201d in the last round of talks in late February, said Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who consults with the White House on trade.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nNegotiators for China and the U.S. are still working to resolve one of the most stubborn sticking points: how to ensure China makes good on its promises to ease burdens on U.S. companies operating in China.\nMr. Lighthizer has sketched out key provisions in Congressional testimony, describing a protocol in which the two sides would hold consultations on disputes, starting with lower-level officials. If those officials didn\u2019t resolve the problem, Messrs. Lighthizer and Liu would get involved. If no agreement is reached, the U.S. could impose tariffs, Mr. Lighthizer has said.\nBut he hasn\u2019t publicly discussed another U.S. priority\u2014that China agree not to retaliate against U.S. tariffs imposed for violations of the pact, at least in some circumstances. Beijing hasn\u2019t approved that request.\nAnother big issue is the pace at which the two sides would remove tariffs now in force. The U.S. wants to roll them back slowly, after China reaches certain milestones. Beijing wants the tariffs quickly lifted.\nU.S. negotiators have divided the tariffs into two kinds. They are more willing to roll back the 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which took effect in September as the U.S. tried to put more pressure on China\u2014or at least some of those levies..\nBut they want to keep in place the 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods levied, in two stages, in July and August. Those tariffs was meant to compensate the U.S. for what the White House calculated was the harm to U.S. companies caused by China\u2019s forced technology transfers.\nThe U.S. is also pressing China to ease its restrictions on cross-border data flows, people familiar with the negotiations said. Those talks include permitting U.S. companies to set up cloud computing operations in China and market their services there, rather than being limited to licensing technology to Chinese firms. Negotiations on those subjects are moving slowly, the people involved said.\nWrite to Bob Davis at bob.davis@wsj.com\nAppeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'China, U.S. Set For Next Round Of Talks.'",

And here&rsquo;s how the hearing unfolded:</p>\n<p>Pharma CEOs End Hearing Citing Difficulty Cutting List Prices</p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical executives wrapped up their appearances at the Senate drug-price hearing Tuesday by saying it would be difficult for them to cut U.S. list prices in the absence of new legislation and policy changes.</p>\n<p>Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) told the executives at the end of the nearly 3 1/2-hour hearing: &ldquo;If you lowered list prices it would help.&rdquo; Earlier, he said list prices matter, because some patients pay either full price or a percentage that is based on the list price, rather than on net prices after rebates that manufacturers pay to middlemen.</p>\n<p>But Merck CEO Ken Frazier said: &ldquo;No one can unilaterally lower list prices without running into financial and operating disadvantages.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He and other executives said under the current system, higher list prices actually help them compete with rivals for better insurance coverage, because they result in higher rebates paid to pharmacy-benefit managers and other middlemen. PBMs and insurers determine placements on preferred-drug lists, known as formularies, based on rebate negotiations. Some drugmakers favor eliminating the rebate system.</p>\n<p>Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said if the company cut its U.S. list prices, &ldquo;We would lose formulary placement if we were doing that in isolation, especially in very competitive areas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/AZN\">AstraZeneca</a> CEO Pascal Soriot said: &ldquo;The government has to step up and change the rules. Rebates have to go.&rdquo; Earlier he said that if rebates were eliminated in both government and private drug-benefit plans, &ldquo;we would definitely reduce list prices.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Peter Loftus</p>\n<p>Medicaid Best Price Is Barrier to Value-Based Pricing</p>\n<p>The requirement for drug makers to offer Medicaid the best price among almost all other payers is a barrier to agreeing on value-based contracts, says Merck&rsquo;s Kenneth Frazier. That&rsquo;s because such contracts could mean the price for some units of a drug is zero.</p>\n<p>Such contracts tie the amount paid by insurers to the performance of the drug, rather than setting a single price for the drug. &ldquo;If for example a drug didn&rsquo;t work you might reimburse a payer for that unit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That becomes a problem for value-based pricing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Denise Roland</p>\n<p>Merck CEO Critiques the &ldquo;Villainizing of an Industry&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), asked the executives what to do about firms that jack up drug prices of drugs that may be off patent&mdash;firms that don&rsquo;t have much, if any, funding for research and development.</p>\n<p>Merck &amp; Co. Chief Executive Ken Frazier said these companies&rsquo; behavior is &ldquo;abusive.&rdquo; As a contrast, he referenced his own company&rsquo;s off-patent chemotherapy treatment called TICE BCG. Merck&rsquo;s raised the price by $5 over the past decade as other companies stopped production and Merck had to double its supply. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how we make money at Merck. We make money at Merck by inventing new drugs that didn&rsquo;t exist before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s those people that contributed to the villainizing of an industry when the public can&rsquo;t distinguish those people from the research-based companies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>Senators Question AbbVie CEO About Humira</p>\n<p>Senators are asking pointed questions of AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez about the biggest-selling medicine in the world, Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and gut disorders. Humira generated $19.9 billion in global sales for AbbVie in 2018, up 8% from the year before.</p>\n<p>AbbVie and its former parent company, <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/ABT\">Abbott Laboratories</a>, <a data-changepercent=\"-0.10\" data-channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/203724446/composite\" data-symbol=\"ABT\" href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/ABT?mod=chiclets\"> ABT -0.10% </a> have more than tripled the U.S. list price for Humira over the past 10 years, to $5,174 for a box of two pre-filled syringes, from $1,524 in 2009, according to drug-price data provider Elsevier.</p>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>AbbVie also has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/biosimilar-humira-goes-on-sale-in-europe-widening-gap-with-u-s-1539687603?mod=article_inline\">guarded its U.S. market exclusivity</a> for Humira by taking out about 136 U.S. patents covering various aspects of the drug and its manufacturing. Some of the patents don&rsquo;t expire until 2034. The original U.S. patent expired in 2016.</p>\n<p>AbbVie has struck several deals with other companies that are expected to keep competing, lower-priced copycat versions off the U.S. market until 2023. In contrast, competing copies of Humira have already gone on sale in Europe.</p>\n<p>An exchange between Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Mr. Gonzalez illustrated the bipartisan political heat that drug companies are facing.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cornyn said he supports drugmakers getting some exclusivity to earn a profit off their innovations, but he asked Mr. Gonzalez why there are so many patents for one drug.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, remember Humira is like nine different drugs, 10 different drugs,&rdquo; Mr. Gonzalez replied, referring to the various diseases it treats.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Cornyn said it is the same molecule treating different diseases. Mr. Gonzalez said AbbVie ran many clinical trials testing the drug&rsquo;s use in different diseases.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m concerned about is, I support drug companies recovering a profit but at some point that exclusivity has to end so that the patients get access to those drugs at a much cheaper cost,&rdquo; Mr. Cornyn said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cornyn also pressed Mr. Gonzalez to admit that AbbVie sued <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/AMGN\">Amgen</a> for patent infringement to block Amgen from selling a copy of Humira. Mr. Gonzalez said they have reached a settlement deal to allow Amgen on the market in 2023.</p>\n<p>In other questioning, Mr. Gonzalez said AbbVie expects a net price increase of only 0.9% for Humira in 2019, despite a 6.2% increase in its list price last month.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Peter Loftus</p>\n<figure>An error occurred.

WSJ&rsquo;s Jason Bellini takes a look at some of the unconventional steps Americans are taking to access the lifesaving drug. </figcaption></figure>\n<p>The Curious Case of Duexis</p>\n<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) flagged painkiller Duexis as an example of an expensive branded drug that is essentially a combination of two generic drugs. He says Duexis costs $2,400 to $2,600 a month, even though its components&mdash;ibuprofen and famotidine&mdash;can be bought over the counter for $200.</p>\n<p>Duexis is not made by any of the companies represented at Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, but it does represent <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/drugmakers-turn-cheap-generics-into-expensive-pills-1477849345?mod=article_inline\">a broader phenomenon</a>, albeit among smaller drug makers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If taxpayers are paying that money for something that over the counter is $200 a month and we are paying $2,600 a month it&rsquo;s like the taxpayer has &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; written over his face,&rdquo; said Mr. Cassidy.</p>\n<p>The company that makes it, <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/HZNP\">Horizon Pharma</a> PLC, has argued that combining the constituents into a single pill made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Horizon added Tuesday that there is no approved generic equivalent to Duexis and that the Food and Drug Administration advises against substituting Duexis with the single ingredient products ibuprofen and famotidine.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Denise Roland</p>\n<p>Next Up? Maybe PBMs</p>\n<p>Sens. Grassley and Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.) have urged pharma execs not to use their testimony to deflect blame to pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, that administer prescription drug insurance for employers, insurers and the government.</p>\n<p>PBM executives could soon be sitting in the same chairs as the CEOs of Merck and Pfizer are today. The committee is planning to have PBM executives testify at a future hearing similar to today&rsquo;s, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The committee is looking at holding a hearing with PBMs soon and is in discussions with executives about testifying,&rdquo; said a Republican committee staffer. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s finalized though.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Joseph Walker</p>\n<p>PBMs Watching Carefully</p>\n<p>Pharmacy-benefit managers weren&rsquo;t invited to Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, but they were watching carefully.</p>\n<p>The industry trade group Pharmaceutical Care Management Association asserted during the hearing that the proposed Trump Administration rebate rule would increase medicare drug premiums by 25%, cost taxpayers $196 billion, and give drug makers a $40 billion &ldquo;windfall.&rdquo; The <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/TWTR\">Twitter</a> post came after several senators and drug company CEOs said they support the administration&rsquo;s effort to curb the use of rebates in Medicare.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Charley Grant</p>\n<p>The Power of the States</p>\n<p>Mr. Frazier, responding to a question by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), said state governments negotiating drug prices &ldquo;could very well&rdquo; lead to lower prices for patients, depending on the system set up by the state.</p>\n<p>As a point of comparison, he said that when his company deals with foreign government with nationalized health systems, he said prices aren&rsquo;t negotiated but rather forced upon the company. &ldquo;Those prices are imposed,&rdquo; Mr. Frazier said.</p>\n<p>States are increasingly considering&mdash;and passing&mdash;legislation that addresses the growing cost of prescription drugs, with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-states-wage-battles-on-high-drug-prices-drugmakers-fight-back-1495013402?mod=article_inline\">varying success</a>.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>The Role of Rebates</p>\n<p>Mr. Frazier and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla echoed earlier comments from AstraZeneca&rsquo;s CEO Pascal Soriot that if U.S policy banned drug rebates then drug list prices would come down.</p>\n<p>Rebates are discounts negotiated to insurers and other middlemen behind the scenes. Drug makers argue that these rebates mean the prices they really get for their drugs, known as net prices, are much more modest than the public list prices.</p>\n<p>Mr. Frazier said past efforts by Merck to lower its list prices put the company at a competitive disadvantage. He didn&rsquo;t go into detail, but the implication is that Merck suffered because lower list prices meant it couldn&rsquo;t offer the same level of rebates as its rivals. He said if the playing field was level, list prices would come down across the board.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Denise Roland</p>\n<p>The Effect of the Tax Bill</p>\n<p>Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, where many drugmakers are located, asked the executives whether their companies lowered the price of their drugs as a result of the tax overhaul that went into effect in January 2018.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>None of the companies said the tax overhaul directly led to the companies decreasing drug prices. Several said they used the tax benefits on other things, such as investing in research and development. Mr. Bourla said that prices went down in 2018, which was likely a reference to the company&rsquo;s average net price of Pfizer&rsquo;s portfolio of drugs.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>The Criticism Starts</p>\n<p>Mr. Grassley kicked the hearing off with an opening statement that took issue with how drug companies have, in his view, shirked responsibility for growing cost of medicines. &ldquo;Most members of Congress are sick and tired at the blame game,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Next up was Mr. Wyden, who criticized the companies one by one.</p>\n<p>He began with Abbvie Inc., and how Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez&rsquo;s compensation package is tied to sales of top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. &ldquo;AbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring,&rdquo; a reference to a character in J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings novels.</p>\n<p>Mr. Wyden awarded Pfizer Inc. &ldquo;first prize for emptiest gesture on pricing&rdquo; in 2018 for temporarily freezing planned price increases after criticism of the company by President Trump only to increase some drugs earlier this year.</p>\n<p>On Merck &amp; Co., Mr. Wyden criticized the company for announcing price cuts last year of drugs that provided &ldquo;essentially no revenue&rdquo; while leaving unchanged some of its top-sellers, including cancer drug Keytruda.</p>\n<p>He said <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/SNY\">Sanofi</a> S.A. was &ldquo;wringing more and more cash out of people with an incurable disease,&rdquo; and was critical of how the drugmaker has priced its insulin products that are used by diabetic patients.</p>\n<p>Then, Mr. Wyden called out how AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Mr. Soriot once said his $12 million annual salary made him, &ldquo;the lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry&rdquo; which Mr. Soriot said was &ldquo;annoying.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mr. Wyden referenced the company&rsquo;s price increases earlier this year, just days after Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said the industry should self-police on pricing.</p>\n<p>Finally, Sen. Mr. criticized <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/BMY\">Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> for spending more than three times on dividends, stock buybacks, marketing, sales and administrative costs what it spent on research and development in 2017.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>A Risk to Research</p>\n<p>Responding to a question from Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) about what keeps him awake at night, Merck &amp; Co. CEO Ken Frazier responded he is worried about the elimination of a &ldquo;predictable market&rdquo; that allows for capital to be invested&mdash;and risked&mdash;to develop drugs. (<a href=\"http://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/measuring-risks-and-rewards-drug-development-new-research-mit-shows-success-rates-clinical-trials-are-higher-previously-thought?mod=article_inline\">Recent research</a> from Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that just 14 percent of drugs in clinical trials eventually reach approval by U.S. regulators).</p>\n<p>Mr. Frazier said he is concerned that when issues in drug pricing lead the public to think there needs to be &ldquo;outrageous solutions&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps a reference to government price controls&mdash;the future development of drugs could be jeopardized.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>A Pointed Question From Wyden</p>\n<p>AbbVie&rsquo;s Mr. Gonzalez said the drugmaker earns a profit on sales of its drugs in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-u-s-pays-more-than-other-countries-for-drugs-1448939481?mod=article_inline\">other countries</a> even though drug prices are lower than in the U.S.</p>\n<p>If that&rsquo;s the case, Mr. Wyden asked, why can&rsquo;t AbbVie charge lower prices in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fundamental issue is this: our system is built around a variety of pricing around the world,&rdquo; Mr. Gonzalez said. &ldquo;The overall system supports our R&amp;D model. If a market the size of the U.S. were to collapse to the lower end of that pricing model I can just tell you AbbVie would not be able to invest in R&amp;D at the level it is today.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Peter Loftus</p>\n<p>Yes, But...</p>\n<p>Sen. Grassley asked all seven executives if they consider public outcry when pricing a drug. All seven executives said they do, while several hastened to add they consider other factors.</p>\n<p>None, however, admitted to considering the potential of a congressional investigation when pricing a drug.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Charley Grant</p>\n<p>The Criticism Starts</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca Dangles Prospect of Steep Price Cuts</p>\n<p>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Mr. Soriot told senators that the company would be prepared to reduce its list prices by an equivalent amount to the behind-the-scenes discounts that it offers insurers and other middlemen, less the fees attached to them. That would be an extraordinary cut in prices.</p>\n<p>Still, that promise would only hold under sweeping changes to the drug-pricing system, according to his testimony. Currently, the rebates the drug companies offer to insurers are a key part of their negotiating leverage. In the absence of such changes, Mr. Soriot said he supported a policy switch that would direct some of those rebates to funding a cap on out-of-pocket costs for patients.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Denise Roland</p>\n<p>High Interest From the Public</p>\n<p>Demand for seats from the general public at today&rsquo;s hearing is much greater than the supply. Members of the public began lining up outside the Senate office building more than 90 minutes before the hearing was set to begin. For the vast majority of them, the waiting was for naught.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Charley Grant</p>\n<p>Merck Weighs In on Competition From Generic Drugs</p>\n<p>Merck &amp; Co. supports eliminating the use of drug company co-pay coupons when a branded drug faces generic competition, according to prepared remarks from Mr. Frazier, its chief executive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This slows the use of generics and violates the spirit of the Hatch-Waxman drug price competition law,&rdquo; Mr. Frazier said, referring to the 1984 landmark federal law that established modern generic drug regulation.</p>\n<p>Health plans might steer patients to generics with lower copays, so manufacturers of branded drugs may try to counter this with copay coupons that bring down the price for patients. Drugmakers regularly provide the assistance, a practice that health plans combat using so-called &ldquo;copay accumulator&rdquo; programs. The accumulator programs limit the assistance applied toward a patient&rsquo;s deductible.</p>\n<p>Some research has found coupons increase branded sales by more than 60%, through reducing generic sales, and that during five years following the entry of a generic, coupons increase total spending by consumers and insurers up to $120 million per drug.</p>\n<p>In his prepared remarks, Mr. Frazier also said Merck supports ways to encourage generic competition, including a version of the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, or CREATES Act, that has been re-introduced by Mr. Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). The legislation is designed to address several strategies that branded manufacturers use to deny samples of its drugs to generic companies looking to develop cheaper alternatives. In the past, the branded-drug industry had been opposed to the CREATES Act.</p>\n<p>Addressing the slow development of the U.S. biosimilar market, Mr. Frazier said that Renflexis&mdash;its biosimilar product to <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/JNJ\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>&rsquo;s <a data-changepercent=\"-0.30\" data-channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/201724570/composite\" data-symbol=\"JNJ\" href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/JNJ?mod=chiclets\"> JNJ -0.30% </a> Remicade that launched some 18 months ago&mdash;holds just &ldquo;a tiny fraction of the market&rdquo; despite launching at a 35% discount to the price of the J&amp;J drug. Biosimilars, cheaper versions of branded biologic drugs, have faced an uphill climb unseating <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-faces-resistance-from-big-pharma-in-the-u-s-11547206203?mod=article_inline\">incumbents in the U.S.</a></p>\n<p>Frazier said that Merck has a history of &ldquo;responsible pricing.&rdquo; He said from 2010 to 2017, the company&rsquo;s average net price increase across its portfolio each year was in the low to mid-single digits, and that in 2017 fell by almost 2%. That same year the average discount for its medicines was more than 45% lower than the list price.</p>\n<p>&mdash;Jared S. Hopkins</p>\n<p>AbbVie CEO Mum on Humira Pricing in Prepared Remarks</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/ABBV\">AbbVie</a>&rsquo;s <a data-changepercent=\"0.63\" data-channel=\"/zigman2/quotes/202428675/composite\" data-symbol=\"ABBV\" href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/ABBV?mod=chiclets\"> ABBV 0.63% </a> Mr. Gonzalez is expected to propose changes in the Medicare Part D prescription benefit design to limit patients&rsquo; out-of-pocket costs.</p>\n<p>But in prepared remarks for his appearance at Tuesday&rsquo;s hearing, Mr. Gonzalez provided few details about AbbVie&rsquo;s own pricing practices.</p>\n<p>His three-page statement makes no mention of the company&rsquo;s rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira&mdash;the highest-selling drug in the world&mdash;whose price AbbVie has raised repeatedly this decade.</p>\n<p>Mr. Gonzalez argued in favor of passing on to patients the rebates that drugmakers like AbbVie pay to Part D plan administrators. Drug companies have said these rebates keep net pricing growth lower than list price growth, but that industry middlemen don&rsquo;t always pass along the savings to patients.</p>\n<p>AbbVie is &ldquo;prepared to step up and discuss how companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of a patient&rsquo;s out-of-pocket expenses, as we do in other areas covered by commercial insurance,&rdquo; Mr. Gonzalez said in the prepared remarks.

J&amp;J had $40.7 billion in global pharmaceutical revenue last year, up 12% from 2017, according to company data.</p>\n<p>In an eight-page statement, Ms. Taubert said J&amp;J sets prices for its medicines based on their potential to reduce other costs in the health-care system. J&amp;J also considers a new drug&rsquo;s improvement over existing treatments, the ability to fund research for future drugs, and ensuring affordable access to its medicines.</p>\n<p>J&amp;J last month raised list prices on more than 25 prescription drugs by amounts ranging from 3.9% to 6.9%, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which tracks drug prices. They include the antipsychotic Invega, the blood thinner Xarelto, and Stelara for immune disorders. J&amp;J said it doesn&rsquo;t expect additional price actions this year, and the average list price increase across its pharmaceutical products will be 4.2% for the year.</p>\n<p>In 2017, J&amp;J was one of the first drug companies to begin disclosing average <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-prescription-unit-list-prices-rose-8-5-last-year-1488226977?mod=article_inline\">pricing trends</a> for its drugs.</p>\n<p>Ms. Taubert said J&amp;J supports various policy changes to curb drug costs. She said J&amp;J favors a cap on out-of-pocket costs for patients covered by Medicare&rsquo;s Part D prescription benefit, and changes in another part of Medicare to curb the cost of drugs administered in doctor&rsquo;s offices and hospitals.</p>\n<p>Ms. Taubert said eliminating rebates that drugmakers pay to industry middlemen &ldquo;could result in lower list prices, provided these rebates and discounts are not replaced with equally high fees or other payments demanded by middlemen. We also strongly advocate that beneficiary copays be based on net price.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&mdash;Peter Loftus</p>\n<p><strong>Corrections &amp; Amplifications </strong> <br>\n AstraZeneca said if drug rebates were eliminated, it would cut its prices by an amount equivalent to the rebates less certain administrative fees. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it would reduce list prices by more than the rebate. (Feb. 26)</p>",

                "text": "Here\u2019s an article previewing the hearing. And here\u2019s how the hearing unfolded:\nPharma CEOs End Hearing Citing Difficulty Cutting List Prices\nPharmaceutical executives wrapped up their appearances at the Senate drug-price hearing Tuesday by saying it would be difficult for them to cut U.S. list prices in the absence of new legislation and policy changes.\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) told the executives at the end of the nearly 3 1/2-hour hearing: \u201cIf you lowered list prices it would help.\u201d Earlier, he said list prices matter, because some patients pay either full price or a percentage that is based on the list price, rather than on net prices after rebates that manufacturers pay to middlemen.\nBut Merck CEO Ken Frazier said: \u201cNo one can unilaterally lower list prices without running into financial and operating disadvantages.\u201d\nHe and other executives said under the current system, higher list prices actually help them compete with rivals for better insurance coverage, because they result in higher rebates paid to pharmacy-benefit managers and other middlemen. PBMs and insurers determine placements on preferred-drug lists, known as formularies, based on rebate negotiations. Some drugmakers favor eliminating the rebate system.\nSanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said if the company cut its U.S. list prices, \u201cWe would lose formulary placement if we were doing that in isolation, especially in very competitive areas.\u201d\nAstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said: \u201cThe government has to step up and change the rules. Rebates have to go.\u201d Earlier he said that if rebates were eliminated in both government and private drug-benefit plans, \u201cwe would definitely reduce list prices.\u201d\n\u2014Peter Loftus\nMedicaid Best Price Is Barrier to Value-Based Pricing\nThe requirement for drug makers to offer Medicaid the best price among almost all other payers is a barrier to agreeing on value-based contracts, says Merck\u2019s Kenneth Frazier. That\u2019s because such contracts could mean the price for some units of a drug is zero.\nSuch contracts tie the amount paid by insurers to the performance of the drug, rather than setting a single price for the drug. \u201cIf for example a drug didn\u2019t work you might reimburse a payer for that unit,\u201d he said. \u201cThat becomes a problem for value-based pricing.\u201d\n\u2014Denise Roland\nMerck CEO Critiques the \u201cVillainizing of an Industry\u201d\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), asked the executives what to do about firms that jack up drug prices of drugs that may be off patent\u2014firms that don\u2019t have much, if any, funding for research and development.\nMerck & Co. Chief Executive Ken Frazier said these companies\u2019 behavior is \u201cabusive.\u201d As a contrast, he referenced his own company\u2019s off-patent chemotherapy treatment called TICE BCG. Merck\u2019s raised the price by $5 over the past decade as other companies stopped production and Merck had to double its supply. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we make money at Merck. We make money at Merck by inventing new drugs that didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s those people that contributed to the villainizing of an industry when the public can\u2019t distinguish those people from the research-based companies.\u201d\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nSenators Question AbbVie CEO About Humira\nSenators are asking pointed questions of AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez about the biggest-selling medicine in the world, Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and gut disorders. Humira generated $19.9 billion in global sales for AbbVie in 2018, up 8% from the year before.\nAbbVie and its former parent company, Abbott Laboratories, ABT -0.10% have more than tripled the U.S. list price for Humira over the past 10 years, to $5,174 for a box of two pre-filled syringes, from $1,524 in 2009, according to drug-price data provider Elsevier.\nRelated Coverage\nAbbVie also has guarded its U.S. market exclusivity for Humira by taking out about 136 U.S. patents covering various aspects of the drug and its manufacturing. Some of the patents don\u2019t expire until 2034. The original U.S. patent expired in 2016.\nAbbVie has struck several deals with other companies that are expected to keep competing, lower-priced copycat versions off the U.S. market until 2023. In contrast, competing copies of Humira have already gone on sale in Europe.\nAn exchange between Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Mr. Gonzalez illustrated the bipartisan political heat that drug companies are facing.\nMr. Cornyn said he supports drugmakers getting some exclusivity to earn a profit off their innovations, but he asked Mr. Gonzalez why there are so many patents for one drug.\n\u201cWell, remember Humira is like nine different drugs, 10 different drugs,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez replied, referring to the various diseases it treats.\nBut Mr. Cornyn said it is the same molecule treating different diseases. Mr. Gonzalez said AbbVie ran many clinical trials testing the drug\u2019s use in different diseases.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about is, I support drug companies recovering a profit but at some point that exclusivity has to end so that the patients get access to those drugs at a much cheaper cost,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said.\nMr. Cornyn also pressed Mr. Gonzalez to admit that AbbVie sued Amgen for patent infringement to block Amgen from selling a copy of Humira. Mr. Gonzalez said they have reached a settlement deal to allow Amgen on the market in 2023.\nIn other questioning, Mr. Gonzalez said AbbVie expects a net price increase of only 0.9% for Humira in 2019, despite a 6.2% increase in its list price last month.\n\u2014Peter Loftus\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nThe Curious Case of Duexis\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) flagged painkiller Duexis as an example of an expensive branded drug that is essentially a combination of two generic drugs. He says Duexis costs $2,400 to $2,600 a month, even though its components\u2014ibuprofen and famotidine\u2014can be bought over the counter for $200.\nDuexis is not made by any of the companies represented at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, but it does represent a broader phenomenon, albeit among smaller drug makers.\n\u201cIf taxpayers are paying that money for something that over the counter is $200 a month and we are paying $2,600 a month it\u2019s like the taxpayer has \u2018stupid\u2019 written over his face,\u201d said Mr. Cassidy.\nThe company that makes it, Horizon Pharma PLC, has argued that combining the constituents into a single pill made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen.\nA spokesman for Horizon added Tuesday that there is no approved generic equivalent to Duexis and that the Food and Drug Administration advises against substituting Duexis with the single ingredient products ibuprofen and famotidine.\n\u2014Denise Roland\nNext Up? Maybe PBMs\nSens. Grassley and Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.) have urged pharma execs not to use their testimony to deflect blame to pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, that administer prescription drug insurance for employers, insurers and the government.\nPBM executives could soon be sitting in the same chairs as the CEOs of Merck and Pfizer are today. The committee is planning to have PBM executives testify at a future hearing similar to today\u2019s, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\u201cThe committee is looking at holding a hearing with PBMs soon and is in discussions with executives about testifying,\u201d said a Republican committee staffer. \u201cNothing\u2019s finalized though.\u201d\n\u2014Joseph Walker\nPBMs Watching Carefully\nPharmacy-benefit managers weren\u2019t invited to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, but they were watching carefully.\nThe industry trade group Pharmaceutical Care Management Association asserted during the hearing that the proposed Trump Administration rebate rule would increase medicare drug premiums by 25%, cost taxpayers $196 billion, and give drug makers a $40 billion \u201cwindfall.\u201d The Twitter post came after several senators and drug company CEOs said they support the administration\u2019s effort to curb the use of rebates in Medicare.\n\u2014Charley Grant\nThe Power of the States\nMr. Frazier, responding to a question by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), said state governments negotiating drug prices \u201ccould very well\u201d lead to lower prices for patients, depending on the system set up by the state.\nAs a point of comparison, he said that when his company deals with foreign government with nationalized health systems, he said prices aren\u2019t negotiated but rather forced upon the company. \u201cThose prices are imposed,\u201d Mr. Frazier said.\nStates are increasingly considering\u2014and passing\u2014legislation that addresses the growing cost of prescription drugs, with varying success.\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nThe Role of Rebates\nMr. Frazier and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla echoed earlier comments from AstraZeneca\u2019s CEO Pascal Soriot that if U.S policy banned drug rebates then drug list prices would come down.\nRebates are discounts negotiated to insurers and other middlemen behind the scenes. Drug makers argue that these rebates mean the prices they really get for their drugs, known as net prices, are much more modest than the public list prices.\nMr. Frazier said past efforts by Merck to lower its list prices put the company at a competitive disadvantage. He didn\u2019t go into detail, but the implication is that Merck suffered because lower list prices meant it couldn\u2019t offer the same level of rebates as its rivals. He said if the playing field was level, list prices would come down across the board.\n\u2014Denise Roland\nThe Effect of the Tax Bill\nSen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, where many drugmakers are located, asked the executives whether their companies lowered the price of their drugs as a result of the tax overhaul that went into effect in January 2018.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nNone of the companies said the tax overhaul directly led to the companies decreasing drug prices. Several said they used the tax benefits on other things, such as investing in research and development. Mr. Bourla said that prices went down in 2018, which was likely a reference to the company\u2019s average net price of Pfizer\u2019s portfolio of drugs.\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nThe Criticism Starts\nMr. Grassley kicked the hearing off with an opening statement that took issue with how drug companies have, in his view, shirked responsibility for growing cost of medicines. \u201cMost members of Congress are sick and tired at the blame game,\u201d he said.\nNext up was Mr. Wyden, who criticized the companies one by one.\nHe began with Abbvie Inc., and how Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez\u2019s compensation package is tied to sales of top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. \u201cAbbVie protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring,\u201d a reference to a character in J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings novels.\nMr. Wyden awarded Pfizer Inc. \u201cfirst prize for emptiest gesture on pricing\u201d in 2018 for temporarily freezing planned price increases after criticism of the company by President Trump only to increase some drugs earlier this year.\nOn Merck & Co., Mr. Wyden criticized the company for announcing price cuts last year of drugs that provided \u201cessentially no revenue\u201d while leaving unchanged some of its top-sellers, including cancer drug Keytruda.\nHe said Sanofi S.A. was \u201cwringing more and more cash out of people with an incurable disease,\u201d and was critical of how the drugmaker has priced its insulin products that are used by diabetic patients.\nThen, Mr. Wyden called out how AstraZeneca\u2019s Mr. Soriot once said his $12 million annual salary made him, \u201cthe lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry\u201d which Mr. Soriot said was \u201cannoying.\u201d\nFor Johnson & Johnson, Mr. Wyden referenced the company\u2019s price increases earlier this year, just days after Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said the industry should self-police on pricing.\nFinally, Sen. Mr. criticized Bristol-Myers Squibb for spending more than three times on dividends, stock buybacks, marketing, sales and administrative costs what it spent on research and development in 2017.\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nA Risk to Research\nResponding to a question from Sen. Pat Roberts (R., Kan.) about what keeps him awake at night, Merck & Co. CEO Ken Frazier responded he is worried about the elimination of a \u201cpredictable market\u201d that allows for capital to be invested\u2014and risked\u2014to develop drugs. (Recent research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that just 14 percent of drugs in clinical trials eventually reach approval by U.S. regulators).\nMr. Frazier said he is concerned that when issues in drug pricing lead the public to think there needs to be \u201coutrageous solutions\u201d\u2014perhaps a reference to government price controls\u2014the future development of drugs could be jeopardized.\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nA Pointed Question From Wyden\nAbbVie\u2019s Mr. Gonzalez said the drugmaker earns a profit on sales of its drugs in other countries even though drug prices are lower than in the U.S.\nIf that\u2019s the case, Mr. Wyden asked, why can\u2019t AbbVie charge lower prices in the U.S.?\n\u201cThe fundamental issue is this: our system is built around a variety of pricing around the world,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cThe overall system supports our R&D model. If a market the size of the U.S. were to collapse to the lower end of that pricing model I can just tell you AbbVie would not be able to invest in R&D at the level it is today.\u201d\n\u2014Peter Loftus\nYes, But...\nSen. Grassley asked all seven executives if they consider public outcry when pricing a drug. All seven executives said they do, while several hastened to add they consider other factors.\nNone, however, admitted to considering the potential of a congressional investigation when pricing a drug.\n\u2014Charley Grant\nThe Criticism Starts\nAstraZeneca Dangles Prospect of Steep Price Cuts\nAstraZeneca\u2019s Mr. Soriot told senators that the company would be prepared to reduce its list prices by an equivalent amount to the behind-the-scenes discounts that it offers insurers and other middlemen, less the fees attached to them. That would be an extraordinary cut in prices.\nStill, that promise would only hold under sweeping changes to the drug-pricing system, according to his testimony. Currently, the rebates the drug companies offer to insurers are a key part of their negotiating leverage. In the absence of such changes, Mr. Soriot said he supported a policy switch that would direct some of those rebates to funding a cap on out-of-pocket costs for patients.\n\u2014Denise Roland\nHigh Interest From the Public\nDemand for seats from the general public at today\u2019s hearing is much greater than the supply. Members of the public began lining up outside the Senate office building more than 90 minutes before the hearing was set to begin. For the vast majority of them, the waiting was for naught.\n\u2014Charley Grant\nMerck Weighs In on Competition From Generic Drugs\nMerck & Co. supports eliminating the use of drug company co-pay coupons when a branded drug faces generic competition, according to prepared remarks from Mr. Frazier, its chief executive.\n\u201cThis slows the use of generics and violates the spirit of the Hatch-Waxman drug price competition law,\u201d Mr. Frazier said, referring to the 1984 landmark federal law that established modern generic drug regulation.\nHealth plans might steer patients to generics with lower copays, so manufacturers of branded drugs may try to counter this with copay coupons that bring down the price for patients. Drugmakers regularly provide the assistance, a practice that health plans combat using so-called \u201ccopay accumulator\u201d programs. The accumulator programs limit the assistance applied toward a patient\u2019s deductible.\nSome research has found coupons increase branded sales by more than 60%, through reducing generic sales, and that during five years following the entry of a generic, coupons increase total spending by consumers and insurers up to $120 million per drug.\nIn his prepared remarks, Mr. Frazier also said Merck supports ways to encourage generic competition, including a version of the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act, or CREATES Act, that has been re-introduced by Mr. Grassley and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.). The legislation is designed to address several strategies that branded manufacturers use to deny samples of its drugs to generic companies looking to develop cheaper alternatives. In the past, the branded-drug industry had been opposed to the CREATES Act.\nAddressing the slow development of the U.S. biosimilar market, Mr. Frazier said that Renflexis\u2014its biosimilar product to Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JNJ -0.30% Remicade that launched some 18 months ago\u2014holds just \u201ca tiny fraction of the market\u201d despite launching at a 35% discount to the price of the J&J drug. Biosimilars, cheaper versions of branded biologic drugs, have faced an uphill climb unseating incumbents in the U.S.\nFrazier said that Merck has a history of \u201cresponsible pricing.\u201d He said from 2010 to 2017, the company\u2019s average net price increase across its portfolio each year was in the low to mid-single digits, and that in 2017 fell by almost 2%. That same year the average discount for its medicines was more than 45% lower than the list price.\n\u2014Jared S. Hopkins\nAbbVie CEO Mum on Humira Pricing in Prepared Remarks\nAbbVie\u2019s ABBV 0.63% Mr. Gonzalez is expected to propose changes in the Medicare Part D prescription benefit design to limit patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs.\nBut in prepared remarks for his appearance at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Mr. Gonzalez provided few details about AbbVie\u2019s own pricing practices.\nHis three-page statement makes no mention of the company\u2019s rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira\u2014the highest-selling drug in the world\u2014whose price AbbVie has raised repeatedly this decade.\nMr. Gonzalez argued in favor of passing on to patients the rebates that drugmakers like AbbVie pay to Part D plan administrators. Drug companies have said these rebates keep net pricing growth lower than list price growth, but that industry middlemen don\u2019t always pass along the savings to patients.\nAbbVie is \u201cprepared to step up and discuss how companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of a patient\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses, as we do in other areas covered by commercial insurance,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said in the prepared remarks. He said the government should also consider allowing Part D patients to purchase insurance to cover more of their out-of-pocket costs.\nMr. Gonzalez touted AbbVie\u2019s pricing of the hepatitis C drug Mavyret, which carries a lower list price than some competing drugs.\nHe is likely to face questions from senators about Humira. AbbVie has obtained dozens of U.S. patents that it expects will keep competing copycat versions of Humira off the U.S. market until about 2023, two decades after the drug\u2019s introduction. Critics have said AbbVie abused the patent system by taking out so many patents, but AbbVie has said it is protecting its investments in an innovative drug.\n\u2014Peter Loftus\nJohnson & Johnson Details Price Increases\nJohnson & Johnson JNJ -0.30% said Tuesday it provided about $21 billion in discounts and rebates for its prescription medicines in 2018, amounting to a 47% reduction from its list prices.\nThe head of J&J\u2019s pharmaceutical division, Jennifer Taubert, said in prepared remarks for Tuesday\u2019s hearing that while the company\u2019s aggregate list price rose 6.3% in 2018, the rebates and discounts swung its net pricing to a decline of 6.8%. J&J had $40.7 billion in global pharmaceutical revenue last year, up 12% from 2017, according to company data.\nIn an eight-page statement, Ms. Taubert said J&J sets prices for its medicines based on their potential to reduce other costs in the health-care system. J&J also considers a new drug\u2019s improvement over existing treatments, the ability to fund research for future drugs, and ensuring affordable access to its medicines.\nJ&J last month raised list prices on more than 25 prescription drugs by amounts ranging from 3.9% to 6.9%, according to Rx Savings Solutions, which tracks drug prices. They include the antipsychotic Invega, the blood thinner Xarelto, and Stelara for immune disorders. J&J said it doesn\u2019t expect additional price actions this year, and the average list price increase across its pharmaceutical products will be 4.2% for the year.\nIn 2017, J&J was one of the first drug companies to begin disclosing average pricing trends for its drugs.\nMs. Taubert said J&J supports various policy changes to curb drug costs. She said J&J favors a cap on out-of-pocket costs for patients covered by Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription benefit, and changes in another part of Medicare to curb the cost of drugs administered in doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals.\nMs. Taubert said eliminating rebates that drugmakers pay to industry middlemen \u201ccould result in lower list prices, provided these rebates and discounts are not replaced with equally high fees or other payments demanded by middlemen. We also strongly advocate that beneficiary copays be based on net price.\u201d\n\u2014Peter Loftus\nCorrections & Amplifications\nAstraZeneca said if drug rebates were eliminated, it would cut its prices by an amount equivalent to the rebates less certain administrative fees. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it would reduce list prices by more than the rebate. (Feb. 26)",

Protests erupted this month after <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fires-in-venezuelas-el-guri-complex-could-have-sparked-blackout-11552667168?mod=article_inline\">a dayslong nationwide blackout </a>that left residents without lights or water, spoiling what little food people had in their refrigerators.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Something new is happening in the barrios,&rdquo; said Father Alfredo Infante, a Jesuit priest in La Vega. &ldquo;They feel connected to Guaid&oacute; in a way they haven&rsquo;t with other opposition leaders. He comes from a poor background, and looks like he belongs in the barrio.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Across barrios, fading murals celebrating former leader Hugo Ch&aacute;vez compete with fresh graffiti demanding &ldquo;Fuera Maduro,&rdquo; or Maduro Out. Many blame government brutality for the shift, a violent crackdown that pits the government against the very people who put it in power.</p>\n<p>Security forces killed 50 people so far this year, mostly in the barrios, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas group that tracks government abuse. Some 653 other people have been arrested this year at protests or for speaking against the government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never seen so much repression as this year,&rdquo; said Gonzalo Himiob, a director at Foro Penal. The homes of some opposition leaders have been marked with spray paint by barrio gangs, he said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Himiob and others blame the country&rsquo;s special forces police, known as FAES, a unit known for extrajudicial executions of suspected criminals and, increasingly, political activists.</p>\n<p>Members of these armed forces wear ski masks and are believed responsible for most of the estimated 3,717 extrajudicial killings in the past two years, mostly of suspected criminals in barrios, according to Families of Victims Committee, or Cofavic, a local human-rights group.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_IM_20190315161220.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_P_20190315161220.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_D_20190315161220.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_G_20190315161220.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_P_20190315161220.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_J_20190315161220.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL430_VENBAR_M_20190315161220.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Members of the Venezuela&rsquo;s special forces police, known as FAES, in a Caracas slum during an anticrime operation in January.</h4>   Photo:  Roman Camacho/SOPA Images/ZUMA PRESS  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the slums of Carora, in Lara state, at least five youths who attended opposition protests on Jan. 23 were killed by special forces, according to witnesses interviewed by Cofavic.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re hearing more cases of people who are targeted because they took part in protests,&rdquo; said Liliana Ortega, the head of Cofavic. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a form of social control to inhibit or discourage these areas from rising up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After Mr. Guaid&oacute; declared himself interim president, street vendor Jhonny Godoy celebrated outside his home in La Vega, a sprawling Caracas slum.</p>\n<p>The 29-year-old evangelical Christian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj9zoqNj6tI&mod=article_inline\">posted a video of himself </a>waving a Venezuelan flag and shouting: &ldquo;Who are we? Venezuelans. What do we want? Maduro gone!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two days later, on Jan. 25, masked police dragged Mr. Godoy from his house, his mother protesting, and took him to nearby alley. He was shot in the foot and stomach and had a diaper stuffed in his mouth, which neighbors interpreted as a message to other would-be rebels considering speaking out against Mr. Maduro.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I heard lots of shots, and my son cry out &lsquo;Jehova, Jehova,&rsquo;&rdquo; Cecilia Buitrago, Mr. Godoy&rsquo;s mother, t<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1103107285000302592?mod=article_inline\">old Mr. Guaid&oacute; in a meeting </a>shortly after the killing.</p>\n<p>The corpse was returned to the family two days later, and Mr. Godoy&rsquo;s mother remains in hiding.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Symbolically, it is a huge blow to the government to lose the support of the barrios,&rdquo; said John Polga -Hecimovich, a political-science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy. In practical terms, it probably means more repression. Barrios took a high-profile role in Venezuela&rsquo;s recent history.</p>\n<p>In February 1989, a barrio uprising over increases in transport prices led to a crackdown by army and police that killed hundreds.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The massacre inspired a previously unknown Lt. Col. Hugo Ch&aacute;vez to attempt an overthrow of then-President Carlos Andr&eacute;s P&eacute;rez in a failed 1992 coup.</p>\n<p>Once Mr. Ch&aacute;vez took power in 1999, he championed the barrios. One government program, Barrio Adentro, built health-care clinics staffed by Cuban doctors. Local clinics saved residents long trips to public hospitals.</p>\n<p>The barrios, in turn, saved Mr. Ch&aacute;vez in 2002. Thousands of residents staged street protests to demand his return after a faction of the armed forces briefly pushed him from power. El Comandante, as he was known, was so popular in barrios that few opposition politicians dared campaign there.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_M_20190315160159.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_H_20190315160159.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_D_20190315160159.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_G_20190315160159.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_H_20190315160159.jpg 620w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_P_20190315160159.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_J_20190315160159.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL413_VENBAR_M_20190315160159.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Residents in La Vega gathered for a public meeting.</h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>The economic crisis has left the barrios in far worse shape.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the poorest 20% of the nation&rsquo;s population had 3.35% of the wealth.

As is common, many in Ms. Pi&ntilde;ango&rsquo;s family have left the country and send her money.</p>\n<p>At the El Araguare preschool, only a dozen or so students remain in a class that started with 35 in September. On a recent day, there were two, said their teacher Mercedes Garc&iacute;a. &ldquo;School seems like a low priority when families are struggling to eat,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Working men like Angelo Chacon have lost jobs in construction, now at a standstill. He and others are trying to grow food on the slum&rsquo;s adjacent hillsides.</p>\n<p>He recently showed off his crops. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the beans.&rdquo; His tomato crop is dying because the slum is short of water.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_M_20190315160159.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_H_20190315160159.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_D_20190315160159.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_G_20190315160159.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_H_20190315160159.jpg 620w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_P_20190315160159.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_J_20190315160159.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL418_VENBAR_M_20190315160159.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Angelo Chacon, tending his field, is among those in La Vega who are growing their own crops to survive Venezuela&rsquo;s economic crisis.</h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Without enough money for even basics, the owners of beauty shops have mostly closed their doors. Domingo Mojoto, 76, had a storefront on La Vega&rsquo;s main street. He was the district&rsquo;s biggest meat and produce seller, but closed down about 18 months ago after years of price controls and declining wages hurt sales.</p>\n<p>These days, Mr. Mojoto wakes up at 1:30 a.m., has a quick cup of coffee and heads to a nearby mountain spring. He fills up about 20 18-liter drums to sell in La Vega. Any later, he said, and the line for water gets too long.</p>\n<p>An old joke in Venezuela: When people in the barrios couldn&rsquo;t afford beer, a government revolt will follow. Beer consumption, excluding restaurants and bars, declined nearly 90%, to 751,000 liters in 2018 from 9.2 million liters in 2014, according to data from Polar, the country&rsquo;s biggest food company.</p>\n<p>The Maduro government still has supporters, despite the national troubles. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t close my eyes and not see people eating out of the trash,&rdquo; said Seudi Guanipa, 33, an accountant. But she mistrusts the opposition. The blackout was the work of the U.S., she said, repeating a government allegation.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_16RH_20190315161716.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_1000V_20190315161716.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_360V_20190315161716.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_4RH_20190315161716.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_1000V_20190315161716.jpg 620w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_574RV_20190315161716.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_750RV_20190315161716.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL432_VENBAR_16H_20190315161716.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Yulitza Ramos, left, with her daughter Milagros at home in La Vega. The girl&rsquo;s classes have been canceled because of the water shortage.</h4> </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Yet those who agree with Ms. Guanipa have become a rarity these days.</p>\n<p>Venezuela&rsquo;s opposition has made slow inroads into the barrios. In early February, anti-Maduro groups held their first open-air town-hall style meeting in La Vega. It was disrupted by pro-government supporters who blocked nearby roads.</p>\n<p>Neighbors banged pots and pans, and the government backers retreated. At a second meeting, Mr. Guaid&oacute;&rsquo;s supporters spoke out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maduro had a fake election last year, and that is why he is illegitimate,&rdquo; Erick Machado told an applauding crowd of about 120 people.</p>\n<p>Days later, government special forces raided the home of one of the organizers of the meetings, Jos&eacute; Becerrit. Mr. Becerrit, 52, happened to be at a protest. His brother, who was home, said the police commander told him they had orders to &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; Mr. Becerrit.</p>\n<p>Since then, Mr. Becerrit has been in hiding. He said by phone that police stripped his home of a TV and other belongings, including his cologne.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The government says we face a danger of a U.S. invasion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it is the government that&rsquo;s declared a war on the barrios.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_M_20190315160202.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_H_20190315160202.jpg\" srcset=\"https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_D_20190315160202.jpg 140w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_G_20190315160202.jpg 540w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_H_20190315160202.jpg 620w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_P_20190315160202.jpg 700w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_J_20190315160202.jpg 860w,\nhttps://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-DL421_VENBAR_M_20190315160202.jpg 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Red-paint graffiti says &ldquo;Fuera Maduro,&rdquo; or Maduro Out, a message appearing in poor neighborhoods that are turning against Venezuela President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro.</h4>   Photo:  federico parra/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>&mdash;Maolis Castro contributed to this article.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>David Luhnow at <a href=\"mailto:david.luhnow@wsj.com\">david.luhnow@wsj.com</a></p>\n<p>Appeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Venezuela&rsquo;s Poor, a Maduro Power Base, Turn on Regime.'</p>",

                "text": "Support for Mr. Maduro among Venezuela\u2019s poorest fifth of the population has gone from roughly 40% in early 2016 to 18% in February, according to Datanalisis, a respected pollster in Venezuela.\nWith the U.S. and other countries supporting opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim to the presidency, Mr. Maduro\u2019s loss of support among even impoverished Venezuelans strips him of a crucial base, leaving him to rely on the loyalty of his armed forces and paramilitary groups.\nThe country\u2019s ramshackle slums, known as barrios, hug the hillsides of every large city in Venezuela and make up roughly half the national population.\nSince January, activists have railed against Mr. Maduro in town-hall meetings that have sprung up in many barrios. Protests erupted this month after a dayslong nationwide blackout that left residents without lights or water, spoiling what little food people had in their refrigerators.\n\u201cSomething new is happening in the barrios,\u201d said Father Alfredo Infante, a Jesuit priest in La Vega. \u201cThey feel connected to Guaid\u00f3 in a way they haven\u2019t with other opposition leaders. He comes from a poor background, and looks like he belongs in the barrio.\u201d\nAcross barrios, fading murals celebrating former leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez compete with fresh graffiti demanding \u201cFuera Maduro,\u201d or Maduro Out. Many blame government brutality for the shift, a violent crackdown that pits the government against the very people who put it in power.\nSecurity forces killed 50 people so far this year, mostly in the barrios, according to Foro Penal, a Caracas group that tracks government abuse. Some 653 other people have been arrested this year at protests or for speaking against the government.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen so much repression as this year,\u201d said Gonzalo Himiob, a director at Foro Penal. The homes of some opposition leaders have been marked with spray paint by barrio gangs, he said.\nMr. Himiob and others blame the country\u2019s special forces police, known as FAES, a unit known for extrajudicial executions of suspected criminals and, increasingly, political activists.\nMembers of these armed forces wear ski masks and are believed responsible for most of the estimated 3,717 extrajudicial killings in the past two years, mostly of suspected criminals in barrios, according to Families of Victims Committee, or Cofavic, a local human-rights group.\nIn the slums of Carora, in Lara state, at least five youths who attended opposition protests on Jan. 23 were killed by special forces, according to witnesses interviewed by Cofavic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hearing more cases of people who are targeted because they took part in protests,\u201d said Liliana Ortega, the head of Cofavic. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of social control to inhibit or discourage these areas from rising up.\u201d\nAfter Mr. Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president, street vendor Jhonny Godoy celebrated outside his home in La Vega, a sprawling Caracas slum.\nThe 29-year-old evangelical Christian posted a video of himself waving a Venezuelan flag and shouting: \u201cWho are we? Venezuelans. What do we want? Maduro gone!\u201d\nTwo days later, on Jan. 25, masked police dragged Mr. Godoy from his house, his mother protesting, and took him to nearby alley. He was shot in the foot and stomach and had a diaper stuffed in his mouth, which neighbors interpreted as a message to other would-be rebels considering speaking out against Mr. Maduro.\n\u201cI heard lots of shots, and my son cry out \u2018Jehova, Jehova,\u2019\u201d Cecilia Buitrago, Mr. Godoy\u2019s mother, told Mr. Guaid\u00f3 in a meeting shortly after the killing.\nThe corpse was returned to the family two days later, and Mr. Godoy\u2019s mother remains in hiding.\n\u201cSymbolically, it is a huge blow to the government to lose the support of the barrios,\u201d said John Polga -Hecimovich, a political-science professor at the U.S. Naval Academy. In practical terms, it probably means more repression. Barrios took a high-profile role in Venezuela\u2019s recent history.\nIn February 1989, a barrio uprising over increases in transport prices led to a crackdown by army and police that killed hundreds.\u201d\nThe massacre inspired a previously unknown Lt. Col. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to attempt an overthrow of then-President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in a failed 1992 coup.\nOnce Mr. Ch\u00e1vez took power in 1999, he championed the barrios. One government program, Barrio Adentro, built health-care clinics staffed by Cuban doctors. Local clinics saved residents long trips to public hospitals.\nThe barrios, in turn, saved Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in 2002. Thousands of residents staged street protests to demand his return after a faction of the armed forces briefly pushed him from power. El Comandante, as he was known, was so popular in barrios that few opposition politicians dared campaign there.\nThe economic crisis has left the barrios in far worse shape.\nIn 2014, the poorest 20% of the nation\u2019s population had 3.35% of the wealth. Now, it is 1.41%. The share of wealth going to the richest 10%, which includes those high in government, doubled to 61% from 30% over the same period, according to a wide-ranging study of poverty by the Andres Bello Catholic University.\nVenezuela has become the most unequal country in the hemisphere next to Haiti, the study found.\nIn wealthy eastern Caracas, five-star restaurants cater to customers with access to dollars, often high-ranking officials. A pizza pie may cost the equivalent of a month\u2019s wage of barrio residents.\nCommon Luxuries\nHyperinflation has sharply reduced consumer purchases.\nSource: Datanalisis\nLast year, Venezuelans were incensed by an online video showing Mr. Maduro and his wife enjoying a meal at an Istanbul restaurant run by the celebrity chef known as Salt Bae.\n\u201cThe army and top officials here don\u2019t suffer. It\u2019s the barrios that suffer,\u201d said Yasiri Paredes, 32, who runs a food kitchen serving free food in the La Vega barrio. She also is the cousin of Mr. Godoy, the man shot in the alley.\nDuring the blackout that dimmed the capital for five days, top restaurants in Caracas ran on portable generators. But in La Vega, the network of food kitchens like the one run by Ms. Paredes temporarily closed, leaving hundreds of children hungry,\nDuring the blackout, Eloina Pe\u00f1a, 55, sold out the entire inventory of a small bodega she runs in La Vega, fearing the food would spoil. Now she wonders how she will restock. \u201cThe government has us cornered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we just stay quiet, we\u2019ll be accepting these humiliations.\u201d\nSections of La Vega, home to about 120,000 residents, have been without water for nearly 10 months. The occasional water truck that meanders up the steep hillside sometimes goes only to the homes of government supporters, according to residents.\nWhen the Fe y Alegr\u00eda Andy Aparicio parish school had a small fire on its patio last year. firefighters had no available truck to help. Teachers and students used water, dirt and sand to put it out, school official said.\nVenezuela\u2019s rate of hyperinflation, estimated by national economists to now be as high as 2 million percent, is best measured in everyday barrio life.\nYulitza Ramos, 32, has seven children, and her boyfriend makes the equivalent of $6 a month, enough to buy about 2 kilos of rice at black-market prices. They get a box of subsidized food from the government once a month, but it\u2019s not nearly enough. \u201cI used to be able to provide for my kids,\u201d she said, \u201cand now we don\u2019t have enough to eat. I feel like a failure as a mother.\u201d\nHer daughter Milagro, 12, skipped school for a week recently because she had no shoes. \u201cMy mother told me it was either shoes or food,\u201d the girl said.\nAt a local Catholic school, director Martha Pi\u00f1ango also has trouble buying food. A year ago, a kilo of chicken cost the school 140 bolivars, according to receipts. By year's end, the price was the equivalent of 72,000,000 bolivars.\nFrom November to January, the price of a kilo of carrots jumped from 400 bolivars to 4,000. A kilo of onions rose from 600 to 3,720.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for the school to keep going,\u201d Ms. Pi\u00f1ango said.\nOf 40 teachers at the school, 11 have left since September. Some have left the country. Others can\u2019t afford public transportation for the commute. Ms. Pi\u00f1ango\u2019s entire monthly wage can buy four bottles of shampoo. As is common, many in Ms. Pi\u00f1ango\u2019s family have left the country and send her money.\nAt the El Araguare preschool, only a dozen or so students remain in a class that started with 35 in September. On a recent day, there were two, said their teacher Mercedes Garc\u00eda. \u201cSchool seems like a low priority when families are struggling to eat,\u201d she said.\nWorking men like Angelo Chacon have lost jobs in construction, now at a standstill. He and others are trying to grow food on the slum\u2019s adjacent hillsides.\nHe recently showed off his crops. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthat\u2019s where I\u2019ve got the beans.\u201d His tomato crop is dying because the slum is short of water.\nWithout enough money for even basics, the owners of beauty shops have mostly closed their doors. Domingo Mojoto, 76, had a storefront on La Vega\u2019s main street. He was the district\u2019s biggest meat and produce seller, but closed down about 18 months ago after years of price controls and declining wages hurt sales.\nThese days, Mr. Mojoto wakes up at 1:30 a.m., has a quick cup of coffee and heads to a nearby mountain spring. He fills up about 20 18-liter drums to sell in La Vega. Any later, he said, and the line for water gets too long.\nAn old joke in Venezuela: When people in the barrios couldn\u2019t afford beer, a government revolt will follow. Beer consumption, excluding restaurants and bars, declined nearly 90%, to 751,000 liters in 2018 from 9.2 million liters in 2014, according to data from Polar, the country\u2019s biggest food company.\nThe Maduro government still has supporters, despite the national troubles. \u201cI can\u2019t close my eyes and not see people eating out of the trash,\u201d said Seudi Guanipa, 33, an accountant. But she mistrusts the opposition. The blackout was the work of the U.S., she said, repeating a government allegation.\nYet those who agree with Ms. Guanipa have become a rarity these days.\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition has made slow inroads into the barrios. In early February, anti-Maduro groups held their first open-air town-hall style meeting in La Vega. It was disrupted by pro-government supporters who blocked nearby roads.\nNeighbors banged pots and pans, and the government backers retreated. At a second meeting, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s supporters spoke out.\n\u201cMaduro had a fake election last year, and that is why he is illegitimate,\u201d Erick Machado told an applauding crowd of about 120 people.\nDays later, government special forces raided the home of one of the organizers of the meetings, Jos\u00e9 Becerrit. Mr. Becerrit, 52, happened to be at a protest. His brother, who was home, said the police commander told him they had orders to \u201cdisappear\u201d Mr. Becerrit.\nSince then, Mr. Becerrit has been in hiding. He said by phone that police stripped his home of a TV and other belongings, including his cologne.\n\u201cThe government says we face a danger of a U.S. invasion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is the government that\u2019s declared a war on the barrios.\u201d\n\u2014Maolis Castro contributed to this article.\nWrite to David Luhnow at david.luhnow@wsj.com\nAppeared in the March 20, 2019, print edition as 'Venezuela\u2019s Poor, a Maduro Power Base, Turn on Regime.'",

They said similar defendants who had been convicted of failing to report information received punishments much more lenient than those Mr. Manafort is potentially facing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The defendants in those cases are not presented to the world as hardened criminals who are &lsquo;a grave risk&rsquo; of being recidivists after age 70,&rdquo; Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s attorneys wrote.</p>\n<h4>Related</h4>\n<p>Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s team didn&rsquo;t charge Mr. Manafort with involvement in Russia&rsquo;s 2016 efforts, but did say they were examining his interactions <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/manaforts-lawyers-reveal-new-details-of-his-links-to-ukrainian-associate-11546984555?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=19&mod=article_inline\">with his former associate in Ukraine</a>, Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence.</p>\n<p>Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s team didn&rsquo;t address in detail Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s interactions with Mr. Kilimnik. They did attach more than a dozen letters of support from family and friends, extolling Mr. Manafort as a loving father&mdash;who skipped dinner with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush to attend his daughter&rsquo;s graduation from the Brownies to the Girl Scouts&mdash;and as someone who offered financial and emotional support to many of those around him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He is deeply remorseful, has suffered almost unprecedented public shame, and he and his family will have to live with the collateral consequences of his conduct for the rest of their lives,&rdquo; Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s legal team wrote.</p>\n<p>His daughter Andrea Shand recalled that she gave birth to her son shortly before Mr. Manafort was indicted. In the weeks that followed, she described him as being a supportive grandfather even as he was facing mounting legal problems.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I remember stumbling bleary eyed and exhausted into the living room with my son to find my dad sitting in his chair reading the indictment against him for the very first time. He took one look at me, put down the indictment, scooped up my son and told me to go back to bed,&rdquo; she recalled.</p>\n<p>Another former colleague, political consultant and lobbyist Doug Davenport, said that Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s troubles began when he joined Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign&mdash;and suggested that he was being targeted for political reasons.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Paul was simply an easy lightning rod to go after for detractors of candidate&mdash;and now President&mdash;Trump. Unfortunately, a man&rsquo;s life hangs in peril just because he chose to come out of political retirement and to try to help a non-establishment political candidate,&rdquo; Mr. Davenport wrote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s attorneys said Mr. Manafort suffers from &ldquo;severe anxiety, panic attacks, and a constant feeling of claustrophobia,&rdquo; since he has been in solitary confinement for around nine months.</p>\n<p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington found earlier this month that Mr. Manafort had <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-rules-paul-manafort-made-false-statements-in-violation-of-plea-agreement-11550101738?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=article_inline\">lied to investigators about multiple issues</a> after reaching his plea deal.

The total amount of jail time Mr. Manafort will face is dependent on how the judges rule\u2014but his attorneys in Washington asked for a sentence substantially below the 10-year maximum penalty his two convictions carry under the law.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nThe dueling filings paint very different portraits of Mr. Manafort.\n\u201cManafort chose repeatedly and knowingly to violate the law\u2014whether the laws proscribed garden-variety crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and bank fraud, or more esoteric laws that he nevertheless was intimately familiar with,\u201d Mr. Mueller\u2019s team wrote.\nMr. Manafort\u2019s team responded: \u201cThe Special Counsel\u2019s attempt to portray him as a lifelong and irredeemable felon is beyond the pale and grossly overstates the facts before this Court.\u201d\nThe attorneys blamed the political environment for Mr. Manafort\u2019s treatment, and said he would not likely have been prosecuted if Mr. Mueller had not been appointed to investigate Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and any links to the Trump campaign. They said similar defendants who had been convicted of failing to report information received punishments much more lenient than those Mr. Manafort is potentially facing.\n\u201cThe defendants in those cases are not presented to the world as hardened criminals who are \u2018a grave risk\u2019 of being recidivists after age 70,\u201d Mr. Manafort\u2019s attorneys wrote.\nRelated\nMr. Mueller\u2019s team didn\u2019t charge Mr. Manafort with involvement in Russia\u2019s 2016 efforts, but did say they were examining his interactions with his former associate in Ukraine, Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the FBI has linked to Russian intelligence.\nMr. Manafort\u2019s team didn\u2019t address in detail Mr. Manafort\u2019s interactions with Mr. Kilimnik. They did attach more than a dozen letters of support from family and friends, extolling Mr. Manafort as a loving father\u2014who skipped dinner with then-Vice President George H.W. Bush to attend his daughter\u2019s graduation from the Brownies to the Girl Scouts\u2014and as someone who offered financial and emotional support to many of those around him.\n\u201cHe is deeply remorseful, has suffered almost unprecedented public shame, and he and his family will have to live with the collateral consequences of his conduct for the rest of their lives,\u201d Mr. Manafort\u2019s legal team wrote.\nHis daughter Andrea Shand recalled that she gave birth to her son shortly before Mr. Manafort was indicted. In the weeks that followed, she described him as being a supportive grandfather even as he was facing mounting legal problems.\n\u201cI remember stumbling bleary eyed and exhausted into the living room with my son to find my dad sitting in his chair reading the indictment against him for the very first time. He took one look at me, put down the indictment, scooped up my son and told me to go back to bed,\u201d she recalled.\nAnother former colleague, political consultant and lobbyist Doug Davenport, said that Mr. Manafort\u2019s troubles began when he joined Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign\u2014and suggested that he was being targeted for political reasons.\n\u201cPaul was simply an easy lightning rod to go after for detractors of candidate\u2014and now President\u2014Trump. Unfortunately, a man\u2019s life hangs in peril just because he chose to come out of political retirement and to try to help a non-establishment political candidate,\u201d Mr. Davenport wrote.\nMr. Manafort\u2019s attorneys said Mr. Manafort suffers from \u201csevere anxiety, panic attacks, and a constant feeling of claustrophobia,\u201d since he has been in solitary confinement for around nine months.\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington found earlier this month that Mr. Manafort had lied to investigators about multiple issues after reaching his plea deal. That ruling relieved the government of its obligations under the deal, including any leniency in exchange for his cooperation in Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nIn the filing, Mr. Manafort\u2019s team sought to play down the importance of Mr. Manafort\u2019s lies, and asked the judge \u201cto consider the narrow scope of those topics against more than 50 hours that he spent answering the government\u2019s questions.\u201d\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com",

Staff-level engagement ramped up again this year amid planning for a second Trump-Kim summit.</p>\n<p>Keeping talks on a leader-to-leader level allows Mr. Kim to retain the benefits of meeting Mr. Trump, such as burnishing his reputation, while avoiding staff-level discussions on the practicalities of removing his weapons.</p>\n<h4>Related Coverage</h4>\n<p>While U.S. officials take credit for a reduction of tensions including a halt in Korean missile tests, they concede Mr. Kim made no progress toward denuclearization since the last summit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kim Jong Un has concluded that Trump is a good guy to talk to, while conversations at a lower level are a waste of time,&rdquo; said Mr. Wi.</p>\n<p>Another Kim strategy can be termed &ldquo;self-directed denuclearization,&rdquo; said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice minister of Foreign Affairs. In this case, Mr. Kim offers to dismantle nuclear facilities of his choosing, often of unclear value, such as the Punggye-ri test site destroyed in 2018. The symbolic acts give the appearance of progress while avoiding <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-north-korean-diplomat-warns-of-deception-at-coming-hanoi-summit-11550586970?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2&mod=article_inline\">a comprehensive denuclearization framework</a>, handing over a nuclear inventory or allowing inspections.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim&rsquo;s emergence as a calculating negotiator is the latest turn for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-punk-kid-to-21st-century-tyrant-kim-jong-un-seizes-his-moment-1528467258?mod=article_inline\">the 30-something ruler</a> who came to power in the world&rsquo;s most secretive state after his father&rsquo;s death in 2011.</p>\n<p>He killed family members to consolidate power and sped up the nuclear weapons program.

Mr. Kim has said a &ldquo;state nuclear force&rdquo; completed in 2017 puts North Korea on equal footing with the U.S., and defines denuclearization to include the elimination of the U.S. threat as well.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kim has called for lifting sanctions as well as relationship-improving measures, such as a framework to formally end the Korean War.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pompeo said recently that sanctions would remain in force until the threat of nuclear attack was substantially reduced. That marked a shift from the previous U.S. position of demanding total denuclearization before any sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump has sought to entice Mr. Kim to drop his arms by holding out <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-trump-kim-summit-host-vietnam-blazes-trail-for-north-korea-11550843491?mod=article_inline\">the possibility of economic prosperity</a> through investment. The bet is that Mr. Kim, who lived in Switzerland as boy, isn&rsquo;t a tyrant by choice and, if given the chance, might chart a new path for his country.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He may surprise some but he won&rsquo;t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him &amp; fully understand how capable he is,&rdquo; Mr. Trump tweeted on Feb. 8.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55972?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Chinese President Xi Jinping holds a welcoming ceremony for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before their talks in Beijing on Jan. 8.</h4>   Photo:  Xinhua/Reuters  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Supporters have praised Mr. Trump&rsquo;s personal engagement as a bold diplomatic bid to break a decadeslong cycle of threats, broken promises and failed diplomacy that has left the U.S. mired in an unresolved conflict for decades. Mr. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader.</p>\n<p>Skeptics say that the Trump administration is being naive about Mr. Kim, who ordered the execution of his uncle, the assassination of his half-brother and is keeping some 100,000 political prisoners locked up in harsh gulags.</p>\n<p>They say Mr. Kim has no intention of giving up weapons he risked annihilation to build, and is instead using the summits to build global acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state. In his best-case scenario, he will wriggle out of sanctions and get other concessions. In his worst case, he will buy more time to perfect his intercontinental ballistic missile technology.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Kim sees no downside to the talks. He will just show up and see what he can get,&rdquo; said Van Jackson, an Obama administration official and author of a book on North Korea.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55980?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>Missiles are displayed in a military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea, in April 2017.

Before, Mr. Trump was calling him &ldquo;little rocket man.&rdquo; After, Mr. Kim emerged with Mr. Trump saying he had a &ldquo;great personality.&rdquo; More recently, Mr. Trump said <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-says-he-and-kim-jong-un-fell-in-love-1538336604?mod=article_inline\">&ldquo;we fell in love.&rdquo;</a></p>\n<p>Also, Mr. Kim succeeded in getting the U.S. to accept a slower-paced approach to denuclearization, a shift from the do-it-now approach the White House pushed last year.</p>\n<p>Owing to North Korea&rsquo;s isolation and secrecy, Mr. Kim knows more about Mr. Trump than the other way around, another potential negotiating advantage. For example, Mr. Kim knows Mr. Trump is describing his dealings with North Korea as a foreign-policy success ahead of a contentious re-election campaign.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, North Korea is so secretive that even Mr. Kim&rsquo;s age is debated.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Politically Trump is facing a tough domestic situation and Kim Jong Un knows that, and will try to take advantage of that,&rdquo; said Kim Sung-han, the former South Korean vice minister.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55982?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>A banner depicts Messrs.

                "text": "Where Mr. Kim offered concessions before the first summit, he has tried to set conditions for this second meeting on Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi. In the New Year\u2019s speech where he offered to meet again, Mr. Kim also warned that if the U.S. \u201cpersists in imposing sanctions\u201d he would take a \u201cnew path\u201d\u2014a phrase that could mean anything from ending dialogue to more missile tests, observers say.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nCrowds of onlookers gathered in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday hoping for a glimpse of Mr. Kim as he arrived in the city after a 2\u00bd-day journey by train and road from Pyongyang. Security officials closed roads in the downtown area near where Mr. Kim and his delegation are staying.\nA near recluse during his first years in power, Mr. Kim has continued the diplomatic outreach he began around the first summit, meeting the leaders of China and South Korea and exchanging letters with Mr. Trump.\nHe has also continued to process nuclear bomb material, reports show, suggesting he could keep making weapons if talks fail.\nFlaunting the notion that U.S.-led sanctions are crimping Mr. Kim\u2019s style, his propaganda agency published video in recent days of a Mercedes Maybach S 600 luxury limo tooling around Pyongyang\u2014newly acquired, according to NK News, a site that monitors North Korea.\n\u201cKim Jong Un is showing confidence that he believes he can control events,\u201d said Jung H. Pak, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and former Central Intelligence Agency senior analyst on North Korea.\n\u201cThe perception that he is in a position of strength doesn\u2019t bode well for dialogue,\u201d she said.\nOne negotiating tactic adopted by Mr. Kim is to deal directly with Mr. Trump while keeping Mr. Trump\u2019s staff at bay, said Wi Sung-lac, a South Korean envoy to previous talks with North Korea.\nFor example, North Korea rebuffed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a follow-up meeting after the first summit, accusing him of taking a \u201cgangster like\u201d attitude, and a later meeting in New York was canceled. Staff-level engagement ramped up again this year amid planning for a second Trump-Kim summit.\nKeeping talks on a leader-to-leader level allows Mr. Kim to retain the benefits of meeting Mr. Trump, such as burnishing his reputation, while avoiding staff-level discussions on the practicalities of removing his weapons.\nRelated Coverage\nWhile U.S. officials take credit for a reduction of tensions including a halt in Korean missile tests, they concede Mr. Kim made no progress toward denuclearization since the last summit.\n\u201cKim Jong Un has concluded that Trump is a good guy to talk to, while conversations at a lower level are a waste of time,\u201d said Mr. Wi.\nAnother Kim strategy can be termed \u201cself-directed denuclearization,\u201d said Kim Sung-han, a former South Korean vice minister of Foreign Affairs. In this case, Mr. Kim offers to dismantle nuclear facilities of his choosing, often of unclear value, such as the Punggye-ri test site destroyed in 2018. The symbolic acts give the appearance of progress while avoiding a comprehensive denuclearization framework, handing over a nuclear inventory or allowing inspections.\nMr. Kim\u2019s emergence as a calculating negotiator is the latest turn for the 30-something ruler who came to power in the world\u2019s most secretive state after his father\u2019s death in 2011.\nHe killed family members to consolidate power and sped up the nuclear weapons program. In 2017, he engaged Mr. Trump in a harrowing nuclear standoff that led to their first summit, in Singapore last June.\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nFor the young leader, the talks mark a crucial chance to recalibrate relations with the U.S. and help ensure the long-term survival of the regime founded by his grandfather. Mr. Kim has said a \u201cstate nuclear force\u201d completed in 2017 puts North Korea on equal footing with the U.S., and defines denuclearization to include the elimination of the U.S. threat as well.\nMr. Kim has called for lifting sanctions as well as relationship-improving measures, such as a framework to formally end the Korean War.\nMr. Pompeo said recently that sanctions would remain in force until the threat of nuclear attack was substantially reduced. That marked a shift from the previous U.S. position of demanding total denuclearization before any sanctions relief.\nMr. Trump has sought to entice Mr. Kim to drop his arms by holding out the possibility of economic prosperity through investment. The bet is that Mr. Kim, who lived in Switzerland as boy, isn\u2019t a tyrant by choice and, if given the chance, might chart a new path for his country.\n\u201cHe may surprise some but he won\u2019t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Feb. 8.\nSupporters have praised Mr. Trump\u2019s personal engagement as a bold diplomatic bid to break a decadeslong cycle of threats, broken promises and failed diplomacy that has left the U.S. mired in an unresolved conflict for decades. Mr. Trump is the first sitting U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader.\nSkeptics say that the Trump administration is being naive about Mr. Kim, who ordered the execution of his uncle, the assassination of his half-brother and is keeping some 100,000 political prisoners locked up in harsh gulags.\nThey say Mr. Kim has no intention of giving up weapons he risked annihilation to build, and is instead using the summits to build global acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state. In his best-case scenario, he will wriggle out of sanctions and get other concessions. In his worst case, he will buy more time to perfect his intercontinental ballistic missile technology.\n\u201cKim sees no downside to the talks. He will just show up and see what he can get,\u201d said Van Jackson, an Obama administration official and author of a book on North Korea.\nMr. Kim came out of the first summit better than he went in. Before, Mr. Trump was calling him \u201clittle rocket man.\u201d After, Mr. Kim emerged with Mr. Trump saying he had a \u201cgreat personality.\u201d More recently, Mr. Trump said \u201cwe fell in love.\u201d\nAlso, Mr. Kim succeeded in getting the U.S. to accept a slower-paced approach to denuclearization, a shift from the do-it-now approach the White House pushed last year.\nOwing to North Korea\u2019s isolation and secrecy, Mr. Kim knows more about Mr. Trump than the other way around, another potential negotiating advantage. For example, Mr. Kim knows Mr. Trump is describing his dealings with North Korea as a foreign-policy success ahead of a contentious re-election campaign.\nOn the other hand, North Korea is so secretive that even Mr. Kim\u2019s age is debated.\n\u201cPolitically Trump is facing a tough domestic situation and Kim Jong Un knows that, and will try to take advantage of that,\u201d said Kim Sung-han, the former South Korean vice minister.\nDespite the obstacles, even some North Korea watchers who are skeptical of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling support his willingness to try direct engagement with Mr. Kim.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with my colleagues when they say, \u2018Oh, no you can\u2019t meet with Kim Jong Un, it will give him too much credibility,\u2019 \u201d said David Kang, who runs the Institute for Korean Studies at the University of Southern California. \u201cIn my view the more you talk to the North Koreans the better.\u201d\nWrite to John Lyons at john.lyons@wsj.com\nAppeared in the February 27, 2019, print edition as 'A Confident Kim Enters Nuclear Summit.'",

                "html": "<p>The RealReal Inc., a larger competitor to Fashionphile, is preparing for an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the situation. And on Monday, a retail chain owned by <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/SE/XSTO/HM.B\">H&amp;M Group</a> began allowing shoppers in Sweden to buy and sell previously owned goods.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Resale is at the nexus of a lot of trends,&rdquo; said Oliver Chen, a senior equity analyst at <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/COWN\">Cowen</a> Inc. &ldquo;You have a new generation who is interested in sustainability and recycling. But most of all, shoppers just want bargains.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Chen says items in the secondary market sell for 30% to 90% less than the retail price of similar new items.</p>\n<h4>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</h4>\n<p>Would you consider buying pre-owned luxury goods or selling what&rsquo;s in your closet? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p>\n<p>The U.S. luxury resale market totaled $6 billion in 2018, according to the consulting firm Bain &amp; Co. But the overall U.S. recommerce market for clothing, accessories and footwear is far larger and growing fast. It is expected to reach $51 billion by 2023, up from $24 billion last year, according to <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/UK/XLON/DATA\">GlobalData</a> PLC, which prepared the research for a report published by online reseller ThredUP.</p>\n<p>For Neiman Marcus, the investment in Fashionphile&mdash;the terms of which weren&rsquo;t disclosed&mdash;is its second attempt at cracking what some call the &ldquo;preloved&rdquo; market. A partnership with The RealReal ended in 2016, a year after it launched. Chanel had expressed displeasure with the arrangement, according to people familiar with the situation. A Neiman Marcus executive previously told The Wall Street Journal that the partnership didn&rsquo;t make sense at the time for the retailer or its customers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are at a different point in time than we were three years ago,&rdquo; said Neiman Marcus Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck. &ldquo;The resale industry has grown faster and is now something our customers are much more engaged in.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted by Neiman Marcus, half its customers buy or sell preowned luxury goods.</p>\n<p>Neiman Marcus plans to introduce Fashionphile &ldquo;salons&rdquo; to some of its stores, where customers can drop off handbags, jewelry and other accessories. Unlike some of its competitors that operate on a consignment model, Fashionphile pays sellers on the spot for their goods once they have been authenticated. To buy the secondhand goods, shoppers will have to visit Fashionphile&rsquo;s website or one of its four boutiques.</p>\n<p>Mr. van Raemdonck said the move is part of a strategy to increase Neiman Marcus&rsquo;s reach. &ldquo;We want customers to think of us for all the categories we sell, but also those we don&rsquo;t currently offer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Recommerce is one of those areas.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo; Chanel will one day recognize that resale isn&rsquo;t going away. &rdquo;</p>\n<p> &mdash;Fashionphile President Sarah Davis </p>\n<p>The hope is that once they receive the cash, shoppers will spend it buying new items at Neiman Marcus. The retailer plans to test different types of incentives to encourage customers to do that, but Mr. van Raemdonck declined to elaborate.</p>\n<p>One challenge for luxury resellers has been opposition from brands, who worry that the secondary market degrades their image. Chanel is suing The RealReal for <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/keeping-chanel-on-top-in-the-post-lagerfeld-era-11550856539?mod=article_inline\">allegedly selling counterfeit products</a>. The RealReal denies the claims.</p>\n<p>Mr. van Raemdonck said Neiman Marcus won&rsquo;t sell any secondhand products in its stores. By allowing customers to drop off their preowned goods, it is simply providing a service they want, he said.</p>\n<p>A previous lawsuit by Chanel against Fashionphile was settled when the reseller agreed to change some wording on its website to make it clear it isn&rsquo;t affiliated with Chanel, according to Ben Hemminger, Fashionphile&rsquo;s chief executive.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Chanel will one day recognize that resale isn&rsquo;t going away,&rdquo; said Sarah Davis, Fashionphile&rsquo;s president, who started the company in 1999 after selling her own luxury handbags on <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/EBAY\">eBay</a> Inc.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I always wanted to own things that I couldn&rsquo;t afford, but I realized that I could afford them if I bought them secondhand,&rdquo; Ms. Davis said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Hemminger said Fashionphile is on track to sell $200 million worth of goods this year, up 50% from a year ago. That is smaller than RealReal and other luxury resellers such as Vestiaire Collective, according to analyst estimates. Unlike those players, Fashionphile only sells handbags and accessories, not clothing.</p>\n<p>Fashionphile says the average bag sells for $1,400. It has sold trendy items such as Chanel handbags designed in collaboration with the musician Pharrell Williams as well as Chanel Classic Flap bags.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Fashionphile shares with us the mentality that they will only sell the best products,&rdquo; Mr. van Raemdonck said. &ldquo;Other players might be bigger, but they are truly luxury.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Suzanne Kapner at <a href=\"mailto:Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com\">Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com</a></p>",

                "text": "The RealReal Inc., a larger competitor to Fashionphile, is preparing for an initial public offering, according to people familiar with the situation. And on Monday, a retail chain owned by H&M Group began allowing shoppers in Sweden to buy and sell previously owned goods.\n\u201cResale is at the nexus of a lot of trends,\u201d said Oliver Chen, a senior equity analyst at Cowen Inc. \u201cYou have a new generation who is interested in sustainability and recycling. But most of all, shoppers just want bargains.\u201d\nMr. Chen says items in the secondary market sell for 30% to 90% less than the retail price of similar new items.\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nWould you consider buying pre-owned luxury goods or selling what\u2019s in your closet? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\nThe U.S. luxury resale market totaled $6 billion in 2018, according to the consulting firm Bain & Co. But the overall U.S. recommerce market for clothing, accessories and footwear is far larger and growing fast. It is expected to reach $51 billion by 2023, up from $24 billion last year, according to GlobalData PLC, which prepared the research for a report published by online reseller ThredUP.\nFor Neiman Marcus, the investment in Fashionphile\u2014the terms of which weren\u2019t disclosed\u2014is its second attempt at cracking what some call the \u201cpreloved\u201d market. A partnership with The RealReal ended in 2016, a year after it launched. Chanel had expressed displeasure with the arrangement, according to people familiar with the situation. A Neiman Marcus executive previously told The Wall Street Journal that the partnership didn\u2019t make sense at the time for the retailer or its customers.\n\u201cWe are at a different point in time than we were three years ago,\u201d said Neiman Marcus Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck. \u201cThe resale industry has grown faster and is now something our customers are much more engaged in.\u201d\nAccording to a survey conducted by Neiman Marcus, half its customers buy or sell preowned luxury goods.\nNeiman Marcus plans to introduce Fashionphile \u201csalons\u201d to some of its stores, where customers can drop off handbags, jewelry and other accessories. Unlike some of its competitors that operate on a consignment model, Fashionphile pays sellers on the spot for their goods once they have been authenticated. To buy the secondhand goods, shoppers will have to visit Fashionphile\u2019s website or one of its four boutiques.\nMr. van Raemdonck said the move is part of a strategy to increase Neiman Marcus\u2019s reach. \u201cWe want customers to think of us for all the categories we sell, but also those we don\u2019t currently offer,\u201d he said. \u201cRecommerce is one of those areas.\u201d\n\u201c Chanel will one day recognize that resale isn\u2019t going away. \u201d\n\u2014Fashionphile President Sarah Davis\nThe hope is that once they receive the cash, shoppers will spend it buying new items at Neiman Marcus. The retailer plans to test different types of incentives to encourage customers to do that, but Mr. van Raemdonck declined to elaborate.\nOne challenge for luxury resellers has been opposition from brands, who worry that the secondary market degrades their image. Chanel is suing The RealReal for allegedly selling counterfeit products. The RealReal denies the claims.\nMr. van Raemdonck said Neiman Marcus won\u2019t sell any secondhand products in its stores. By allowing customers to drop off their preowned goods, it is simply providing a service they want, he said.\nA previous lawsuit by Chanel against Fashionphile was settled when the reseller agreed to change some wording on its website to make it clear it isn\u2019t affiliated with Chanel, according to Ben Hemminger, Fashionphile\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cChanel will one day recognize that resale isn\u2019t going away,\u201d said Sarah Davis, Fashionphile\u2019s president, who started the company in 1999 after selling her own luxury handbags on eBay Inc.\n\u201cI always wanted to own things that I couldn\u2019t afford, but I realized that I could afford them if I bought them secondhand,\u201d Ms. Davis said.\nMr. Hemminger said Fashionphile is on track to sell $200 million worth of goods this year, up 50% from a year ago. That is smaller than RealReal and other luxury resellers such as Vestiaire Collective, according to analyst estimates. Unlike those players, Fashionphile only sells handbags and accessories, not clothing.\nFashionphile says the average bag sells for $1,400. It has sold trendy items such as Chanel handbags designed in collaboration with the musician Pharrell Williams as well as Chanel Classic Flap bags.\n\u201cFashionphile shares with us the mentality that they will only sell the best products,\u201d Mr. van Raemdonck said. \u201cOther players might be bigger, but they are truly luxury.\u201d\nWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com",

The smaller companies tried more than once to strike a deal only to see the agreement fall apart over terms or fears that the Justice Department would object.\nWireless operators have tried different combinations to shrink the number of national U.S. players from four providers down to three, but so far they have all been foiled. The Obama administration blocked AT&T\u2019s 2011 bid for T-Mobile, saying the market was too concentrated.\nT-Mobile and Sprint executives last year decided to make their case to the Trump administration, saying that without a merger they risked falling behind Verizon and AT&T as the industry upgrades to fifth-generation networks. Combining the smaller companies would arm them with a swath of wireless-spectrum licenses considered ideal for 5G.\nT-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere responded to The Wall Street Journal article in a tweet, saying \u201cThe premise of this story, as summarized in the first paragraph, is simply untrue. Out of respect for the process, we have no further comment.\u201d\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nSprint Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure tweeted, \u201cWe continue to have discussions with regulators about our proposed merger with @TMobile. That process is ongoing and we have no further comment.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokesman didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nSeveral state attorneys general also are reviewing the deal. Some state antitrust officials have expressed concerns similar to those from the Justice Department and have prepared to sue the companies independently if federal officials don\u2019t join them in challenging the merger, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nPublic filings show the Federal Communications Commission is also prodding the companies for more data about several elements of their proposed combination, including the calculated cost savings and how they would use wireless infrastructure to provide home broadband service.\nThe different groups of government officials are operating on similar timelines and a final decision is still likely several weeks away, people familiar with the matter said.\nDiscussions between the companies and government officials are continuing.

But a new study published this past December in the Journals of Gerontology offers hope for those who are struggling.

In 1970, 29% of the population, or 39 million adults aged 18 or older, were single.</p>\n<p>And yet single people still face a stigma. Bella DePaulo, a social scientist and author of &ldquo;Singled Out,&rdquo; has been studying singles since the late 1990s and has coined the phrase &ldquo;singlism&rdquo; to describe the ways in which people discriminate against singles. The stereotyping includes the assumptions that singles are miserable, lonely or selfish; that they are desperate to get married; that there must be something wrong with someone who is single.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some single people internalize all that, even if they like being single,&rdquo; Dr. DePaulo says. &ldquo;They even sometimes think that liking single life is itself a sign that something is wrong with them.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Society is organized around couples&mdash;they get breaks on everything from club memberships to tickets and events. And it can be a drag for singles when people offer advice or insist on fixing them up. &ldquo;I think the phrase &lsquo;fix you up&rsquo; is telling,&rdquo; says Dr. DePaulo. &ldquo;It seems to suggest that you are broken, and that coupling will mend you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She says the hardest time to be single is around the age of 30. That&rsquo;s when the expectation to be married becomes most intense. Friends and relatives are marrying, or are already married, and single people often feel like the odd person out. This feeling is most acute in single people who socialize primarily with couples. &ldquo;Couples often demote their single friends to lunch or daytime events or children&rsquo;s birthday parties, basically treating them as if they are not fully adult,&rdquo; Dr. DePaulo says.</p>\n<p>It is possible for single people to adjust their attitude and become happier. In a not-yet-published study done at Simon Fraser University, in greater Vancouver, British Columbia, psychologists gave single people one of two made-up articles to read, one reporting that singles are generally happy in life and one reporting that they are not. People who read the happy version of the article reported higher levels of life satisfaction and lower desire to find a relationship than those who read the more negative version. Basically, &ldquo;if you have a fear of being single this undermines your well-being,&rdquo; says Yuthika Girme, a social psychologist and lead researcher on the study.</p>\n<p>So how can you be happiest being single? Focus on creating a full life now, for yourself, rather than finding a partner. Surround yourself with other happily single people. Watch the language you or others use to refer to singlehood. (Ever walked into a restaurant alone and had the host ask: &ldquo;Table for just one?&rdquo;) Be proud of the life you&rsquo;ve created.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Happiness is in your hands right now,&rdquo; says Jennifer Taitz, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and author of &ldquo;How to Be Single and Happy.&rdquo; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t depend on external circumstances beyond your control, such as finding a mate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Tomaszewski, who divorced in 2010, transformed her single life after two of her best friends moved to Europe several years ago. At first, she was jealous of their freedom and troubled by how unhappy she was. Her dating life felt like a series of dead ends and her social life was unsatisfying. &ldquo;I decided in that moment to stop living for other people, to stop living with room to grow into the relationship that I may or may not eventually be a part of,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was time to start living for myself, 100%.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Tomaszewski began treating herself as she would a partner. She bought herself lavish birthday gifts and took herself out to dinner for holidays. And she began making her bed&mdash;just as she did when she was in a relationship and stayed at a man&rsquo;s house overnight. &ldquo;Now, when I get home I look at it and think: &lsquo;Aw, that&rsquo;s so sweet. I care about me.&rsquo;&rdquo; She went to therapy, ate healthier and began getting massages. &ldquo;That little bit of one-on-one physical and emotional care keeps me feeling content,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p>Previously, Ms. Tomaszewski says, she viewed time alone as something sad. She began thinking of it as quality time with herself. Now, if she finds herself alone for a weekend, she treats herself to a session with a personal trainer, takes a workshop on how to journal or goes to an art museum. &ldquo;I am nurturing my soul right now, just as I would nurture a relationship,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p>Although she feels ready to meet a partner, she says it will have to happen naturally, such as a friendship that grows into something more. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not waiting for a man,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My life is full. I&rsquo;m my partner, and we are killing it.&rdquo;</p>\n<h4>Living a Happier Life</h4>\n<p>How can single people lead a happier life? Here are some tips:</p>\n<p><strong>Start now.</strong> Don&rsquo;t wait until you have a partner to travel, buy the house, take a risky career move, learn a cool new hobby.</p>\n<p><strong>Assess your life.</strong> What areas do you need to work on? Physical health? Emotional well-being? Finances? Friends? Make a list, rate each area, and prioritize. &ldquo;Look at what you are doing that is creating the action you don&rsquo;t want, then ask yourself what different action you could take,&rdquo; says Lauren Mackler, a Boston psychotherapist and relationship coach and author of &ldquo;Solemate: Master the Art of Aloneness and Transform Your Life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t ruminate on being single.</strong> It will make you feel worse. Research shows that single people who were told they will end up alone scored lower on cognitive tests than those told they will find a partner.</p>\n<p><strong>Build a support network.</strong> Research shows that single people have more friends than married people, but they still believe they have a lack of social support, says Yuthika Girme, a social psychologist. &ldquo;Be honest. Open up. Don&rsquo;t be ashamed to ask for help if you need it,&rdquo; she says.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side.</strong> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what people&rsquo;s stories are,&rdquo; says Dr. Girme. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compare.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule time to do things, or see people, that make you happy.</strong> &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just expect joy to fall into your life,&rdquo; says Jennifer Taitz, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and author of &ldquo;How to Be Single and Happy.&rdquo; You need to plan for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Be spontaneous.</strong> Learn to go do things you enjoy by yourself on the spur of the moment.</p>\n<p><strong>Be fully present.</strong> Whatever you&rsquo;re doing&mdash;working out at the gym, walking in the park, having brunch with friends&mdash;don&rsquo;t constantly check to see if there&rsquo;s someone attractive around to meet.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat yourself as you would a partner you love.</strong> Buy yourself a gift or make yourself a nice dinner. Soothe yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep a list of people you admire</strong> from the past and present who lived great single lives, and use it for inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Elizabeth Bernstein at <a href=\"mailto:elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.com\">elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.com</a> or follow her on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram at EBernsteinWSJ.</p>\n<h4>More From Bonds</h4>",

                "text": "\u201cIt was constant socializing and constant distraction,\u201d says Ms. Tomaszewski, now a 36-year-old Pilates instructor in Chicago. \u201cI became desperate and depressed, looking for someone\u2014anyone\u2014to save me from being alone.\u201d\nYes, it can be tough to be single. But a new study published this past December in the Journals of Gerontology offers hope for those who are struggling. Singles today are more satisfied with their lives than singles in the past, the study found. And people who are single become more satisfied with their lives as they grow older, according to researchers from the German Centre of Gerontology in Berlin, who analyzed data from the German Ageing Survey, a nationally representative sample of people between the ages or 40 and 85. Experts say the findings ring true for Western countries broadly.\nThis is important news, because one of the biggest demographic trends of the past 50 years is the rise of singles: In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey reported that more than 120 million U.S. residents, or almost 48% of adults aged 18 or older, were divorced, widowed or had never been married. In 1970, 29% of the population, or 39 million adults aged 18 or older, were single.\nAnd yet single people still face a stigma. Bella DePaulo, a social scientist and author of \u201cSingled Out,\u201d has been studying singles since the late 1990s and has coined the phrase \u201csinglism\u201d to describe the ways in which people discriminate against singles. The stereotyping includes the assumptions that singles are miserable, lonely or selfish; that they are desperate to get married; that there must be something wrong with someone who is single.\n\u201cSome single people internalize all that, even if they like being single,\u201d Dr. DePaulo says. \u201cThey even sometimes think that liking single life is itself a sign that something is wrong with them.\u201d\nSociety is organized around couples\u2014they get breaks on everything from club memberships to tickets and events. And it can be a drag for singles when people offer advice or insist on fixing them up. \u201cI think the phrase \u2018fix you up\u2019 is telling,\u201d says Dr. DePaulo. \u201cIt seems to suggest that you are broken, and that coupling will mend you.\u201d\nShe says the hardest time to be single is around the age of 30. That\u2019s when the expectation to be married becomes most intense. Friends and relatives are marrying, or are already married, and single people often feel like the odd person out. This feeling is most acute in single people who socialize primarily with couples. \u201cCouples often demote their single friends to lunch or daytime events or children\u2019s birthday parties, basically treating them as if they are not fully adult,\u201d Dr. DePaulo says.\nIt is possible for single people to adjust their attitude and become happier. In a not-yet-published study done at Simon Fraser University, in greater Vancouver, British Columbia, psychologists gave single people one of two made-up articles to read, one reporting that singles are generally happy in life and one reporting that they are not. People who read the happy version of the article reported higher levels of life satisfaction and lower desire to find a relationship than those who read the more negative version. Basically, \u201cif you have a fear of being single this undermines your well-being,\u201d says Yuthika Girme, a social psychologist and lead researcher on the study.\nSo how can you be happiest being single? Focus on creating a full life now, for yourself, rather than finding a partner. Surround yourself with other happily single people. Watch the language you or others use to refer to singlehood. (Ever walked into a restaurant alone and had the host ask: \u201cTable for just one?\u201d) Be proud of the life you\u2019ve created.\n\u201cHappiness is in your hands right now,\u201d says Jennifer Taitz, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and author of \u201cHow to Be Single and Happy.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend on external circumstances beyond your control, such as finding a mate.\u201d\nMs. Tomaszewski, who divorced in 2010, transformed her single life after two of her best friends moved to Europe several years ago. At first, she was jealous of their freedom and troubled by how unhappy she was. Her dating life felt like a series of dead ends and her social life was unsatisfying. \u201cI decided in that moment to stop living for other people, to stop living with room to grow into the relationship that I may or may not eventually be a part of,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was time to start living for myself, 100%.\u201d\nMs. Tomaszewski began treating herself as she would a partner. She bought herself lavish birthday gifts and took herself out to dinner for holidays. And she began making her bed\u2014just as she did when she was in a relationship and stayed at a man\u2019s house overnight. \u201cNow, when I get home I look at it and think: \u2018Aw, that\u2019s so sweet. I care about me.\u2019\u201d She went to therapy, ate healthier and began getting massages. \u201cThat little bit of one-on-one physical and emotional care keeps me feeling content,\u201d she says.\nPreviously, Ms. Tomaszewski says, she viewed time alone as something sad. She began thinking of it as quality time with herself. Now, if she finds herself alone for a weekend, she treats herself to a session with a personal trainer, takes a workshop on how to journal or goes to an art museum. \u201cI am nurturing my soul right now, just as I would nurture a relationship,\u201d she says.\nAlthough she feels ready to meet a partner, she says it will have to happen naturally, such as a friendship that grows into something more. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting for a man,\u201d she says. \u201cMy life is full. I\u2019m my partner, and we are killing it.\u201d\nLiving a Happier Life\nHow can single people lead a happier life? Here are some tips:\nStart now. Don\u2019t wait until you have a partner to travel, buy the house, take a risky career move, learn a cool new hobby.\nAssess your life. What areas do you need to work on? Physical health? Emotional well-being? Finances? Friends? Make a list, rate each area, and prioritize. \u201cLook at what you are doing that is creating the action you don\u2019t want, then ask yourself what different action you could take,\u201d says Lauren Mackler, a Boston psychotherapist and relationship coach and author of \u201cSolemate: Master the Art of Aloneness and Transform Your Life.\u201d\nDon\u2019t ruminate on being single. It will make you feel worse. Research shows that single people who were told they will end up alone scored lower on cognitive tests than those told they will find a partner.\nBuild a support network. Research shows that single people have more friends than married people, but they still believe they have a lack of social support, says Yuthika Girme, a social psychologist. \u201cBe honest. Open up. Don\u2019t be ashamed to ask for help if you need it,\u201d she says.\nRemember that the grass is not always greener on the other side. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what people\u2019s stories are,\u201d says Dr. Girme. \u201cDon\u2019t compare.\u201d\nSchedule time to do things, or see people, that make you happy. \u201cYou can\u2019t just expect joy to fall into your life,\u201d says Jennifer Taitz, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles and author of \u201cHow to Be Single and Happy.\u201d You need to plan for it.\nBe spontaneous. Learn to go do things you enjoy by yourself on the spur of the moment.\nBe fully present. Whatever you\u2019re doing\u2014working out at the gym, walking in the park, having brunch with friends\u2014don\u2019t constantly check to see if there\u2019s someone attractive around to meet.\nTreat yourself as you would a partner you love. Buy yourself a gift or make yourself a nice dinner. Soothe yourself.\nKeep a list of people you admire from the past and present who lived great single lives, and use it for inspiration.\nWrite to Elizabeth Bernstein at elizabeth.bernstein@wsj.com or follow her on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram at EBernsteinWSJ.\nMore From Bonds",

Yet, as we&rsquo;re seeing in the current policy debates in Washington, the parties haven&rsquo;t caught up with their own new realities. In fact, they are facing a kind of identity crisis, in which they are pushing policy prescriptions that aren&rsquo;t really in tune with their changed rank-and-file membership.</p>\n<p>The Democrats, once the party seen, at least in stereotype, as the home of lunch-pail, working-class union members in the Rust Belt, now are a party dominated by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/midterm-results-point-to-a-new-divide-in-politics-education-1541865601?mod=article_inline\">higher-educated</a>, higher-income voters, particularly women, on the coasts, combined with progressive <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-overlooked-key-to-democratic-victories-diversity-in-the-suburbs-1542801601?mod=article_inline\">young voters and minorities</a>.</p>\n<h4>Newsletter Sign-up</h4>\n<p>And the Republicans, once the party seen in stereotype as the party of the country club and the Chamber of Commerce, now are dominated by <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-places-that-made-trump-president-1478902160?mod=article_inline\">working-class</a> and middle-class Americans, particularly men, as well as older citizens in exurban, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-manufacturing-towns-once-solidly-blue-are-now-a-gop-haven-1532013368?mod=article_inline\">small-town and rural America</a>.</p>\n<p>This shift is well illustrated by two groups my Journal colleagues have been tracking closely in recent years: college-educated white women, and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-yawning-divide-that-explains-american-politics-1540910719?mod=article_inline\">men without a college degree</a>. In the 1990s, these two groups voted almost identically: They were just right of center, almost in the middle of the political and ideological spectrum.</p>\n<p>Now they have veered off in dramatically different directions. Last fall, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-educated-women-are-moving-away-from-gop-1514293200?mod=article_inline\">college-educated white women</a> favored Democrats in House races by 33 percentage points, while white men without a college degree favored Republicans by 42 points. These two groups also are rough proxies for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump voters in the 2016 presidential elections.</p>\n<p>As the rank-and-file has shifted, so has the geographical center of the two parties. Among Republicans, New York liberals and California conservatives once coexisted as powerful internal blocs. Indeed, since World War II, Republicans five times picked a presidential nominee from California ( Richard Nixon three times, Ronald Reagan twice), and had a serious California contender as late as 1996 in former Gov. Pete Wilson. Twice they chose New York&rsquo;s Thomas Dewey.</p>\n<figure> <img alt=\"\" data-enlarge=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=1260&size=1.5\" sizes=\"(max-width: 140px) 100px,\n(max-width: 540px) 500px,\n(max-width: 620px) 580px,\n(max-width: 700px) 660px,\n(max-width: 860px) 820px,\n1260px\" src=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=620&size=1.5\" srcset=\"https://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=140&size=1.5 140w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=540&size=1.5 540w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=620&size=1.5 620w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=700&size=1.5 700w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=860&size=1.5 860w,\nhttps://images.wsj.net/im-55899?width=1260&size=1.5 1260w\"></img> <figcaption> <h4>The realignment of voters was on display in the results of both the 2016 and 2018 elections.</h4>   Photo:  andrew kelly/Reuters  </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Now California and New York rarely produce a Republican candidate who can win statewide, much less lead the party nationally. The party is weak on the two coasts, and is centered in the interior of the country.</p>\n<p>Democrats, meanwhile, regularly nominated presidential candidates from the heartland and the South&mdash;Missouri&rsquo;s Harry Truman, Texas&rsquo; Lyndon Johnson, South Dakota&rsquo;s George McGovern, Georgia&rsquo;s Jimmy Carter, Arkansas&rsquo; Bill Clinton, Tennessee&rsquo;s Al Gore. Each of those states has since turned Republican red.</p>\n<p>The problem for the two parties is that these changes are creating some ideological and policy whiplash. Republicans, traditionally dominated by business interests, used to be the party of free trade and open movement of workers across borders. But the new, middle-America Republican party under President Trump has become the party of tariffs and border walls.</p>\n<p>And when the core of the party is older, working-class Americans, can Republicans really advocate cutting entitlements, as former House Speaker Paul Ryan did in the wake of a big tax cut?</p>\n<figure>An error occurred. Please try again later.<figcaption> Now that there's a tentative deal in Congress to avoid another government shutdown, how will Democrats use their majority in the House to advance their own agenda? WSJ's Gerald F. Seib takes a look at possible areas of focus. Photo: AP </figcaption></figure>\n<p>And for Democrats, can the party that increasingly represents wealthier Americans really be the party that stands for a 70% top tax rate and an across-the-board wealth tax on the most well-heeled? And can the party that considers climate change an existential threat really speak to the coal miners and auto workers that used to form part of its core constituency?</p>\n<p>A lot of this realignment is captured in the immigration issue. To vastly overgeneralize, Democrats are the party that embraces diversity. Republicans are the party that fears diversity is changing the face and the economy of America in harmful ways.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, better than most, has understood the change within his own party, while also accelerating it. The new GOP is, for now at least, the party of Trump.</p>\n<p>For their part, Democrats have some tough choices: Do they pursue a more moderate policy path that tries to meld the impulses of the old Rust Belt version of their party with the new coastal and millennial sentiments? A couple of presidential contenders&mdash;Sens. Sherrod Brown and Amy Klobuchar&mdash;are trying to do that. Others&mdash;Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker &mdash;play more to the new, progressive, millennial version of the party.</p>\n<p>Footnote: The odd constituency out in the realigned world may be the business community, which now finds neither party particularly in sync with its free-market view of the world.</p>\n<h4>More</h4>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Gerald F.

                "text": "This realignment was on display in the results of both the 2016 and 2018 elections. Yet, as we\u2019re seeing in the current policy debates in Washington, the parties haven\u2019t caught up with their own new realities. In fact, they are facing a kind of identity crisis, in which they are pushing policy prescriptions that aren\u2019t really in tune with their changed rank-and-file membership.\nThe Democrats, once the party seen, at least in stereotype, as the home of lunch-pail, working-class union members in the Rust Belt, now are a party dominated by higher-educated, higher-income voters, particularly women, on the coasts, combined with progressive young voters and minorities.\nNewsletter Sign-up\nAnd the Republicans, once the party seen in stereotype as the party of the country club and the Chamber of Commerce, now are dominated by working-class and middle-class Americans, particularly men, as well as older citizens in exurban, small-town and rural America.\nThis shift is well illustrated by two groups my Journal colleagues have been tracking closely in recent years: college-educated white women, and men without a college degree. In the 1990s, these two groups voted almost identically: They were just right of center, almost in the middle of the political and ideological spectrum.\nNow they have veered off in dramatically different directions. Last fall, college-educated white women favored Democrats in House races by 33 percentage points, while white men without a college degree favored Republicans by 42 points. These two groups also are rough proxies for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump voters in the 2016 presidential elections.\nAs the rank-and-file has shifted, so has the geographical center of the two parties. Among Republicans, New York liberals and California conservatives once coexisted as powerful internal blocs. Indeed, since World War II, Republicans five times picked a presidential nominee from California ( Richard Nixon three times, Ronald Reagan twice), and had a serious California contender as late as 1996 in former Gov. Pete Wilson. Twice they chose New York\u2019s Thomas Dewey.\nNow California and New York rarely produce a Republican candidate who can win statewide, much less lead the party nationally. The party is weak on the two coasts, and is centered in the interior of the country.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, regularly nominated presidential candidates from the heartland and the South\u2014Missouri\u2019s Harry Truman, Texas\u2019 Lyndon Johnson, South Dakota\u2019s George McGovern, Georgia\u2019s Jimmy Carter, Arkansas\u2019 Bill Clinton, Tennessee\u2019s Al Gore. Each of those states has since turned Republican red.\nThe problem for the two parties is that these changes are creating some ideological and policy whiplash. Republicans, traditionally dominated by business interests, used to be the party of free trade and open movement of workers across borders. But the new, middle-America Republican party under President Trump has become the party of tariffs and border walls.\nAnd when the core of the party is older, working-class Americans, can Republicans really advocate cutting entitlements, as former House Speaker Paul Ryan did in the wake of a big tax cut?\nAn error occurred. Please try again later.\nAnd for Democrats, can the party that increasingly represents wealthier Americans really be the party that stands for a 70% top tax rate and an across-the-board wealth tax on the most well-heeled? And can the party that considers climate change an existential threat really speak to the coal miners and auto workers that used to form part of its core constituency?\nA lot of this realignment is captured in the immigration issue. To vastly overgeneralize, Democrats are the party that embraces diversity. Republicans are the party that fears diversity is changing the face and the economy of America in harmful ways.\nMr. Trump, better than most, has understood the change within his own party, while also accelerating it. The new GOP is, for now at least, the party of Trump.\nFor their part, Democrats have some tough choices: Do they pursue a more moderate policy path that tries to meld the impulses of the old Rust Belt version of their party with the new coastal and millennial sentiments? A couple of presidential contenders\u2014Sens. Sherrod Brown and Amy Klobuchar\u2014are trying to do that. Others\u2014Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker \u2014play more to the new, progressive, millennial version of the party.\nFootnote: The odd constituency out in the realigned world may be the business community, which now finds neither party particularly in sync with its free-market view of the world.\nMore\nWrite to Gerald F.

(Originally publishing July 27, 2018) </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Antitrust observers are now watching closely to see whether the ruling affects the government&rsquo;s willingness to challenge traditional horizontal mergers between major head-to-head competitors, such as <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/TMUS\">T-Mobile US</a> Inc.&rsquo;s proposed acquisition of <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/S\">Sprint</a> Corp., a deal that remains under review at the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion,&rdquo; a Justice Department spokesman said of Tuesday&rsquo;s AT&amp;T ruling. &ldquo;The Department has no plans to seek further review.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The government argued that even though AT&amp;T and Time Warner weren&rsquo;t direct rivals, their combination would form an integrated giant with the power to force higher pay-television prices.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s principal theory focused on the fact that a postmerger AT&amp;T would be both a leading pay-television service provider, including through its DirecTV subsidiary, and an owner of sought-after programming, via Time Warner&rsquo;s portfolio, which included the Turner networks and HBO.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T would be able to force rival pay-television systems to pay more for Turner networks such as TNT and CNN after the acquisition, the department argued. AT&amp;T disputed the claim, saying that it wouldn&rsquo;t have the leverage to raise prices because it would lose money if Turner didn&rsquo;t appear widely on pay-television lineups around the U.S.</p>\n<p>From day one, the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/dojs-behind-the-scenes-struggles-with-judge-in-at-t-case-1533682305?mod=article_inline\">Justice Department struggled</a> in litigating its case, drawing repeated criticism from Judge Leon as he presided over the trial.</p>\n<p>In his 172-page ruling, Judge Leon said a postmerger AT&amp;T wasn&rsquo;t likely to have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-is-set-to-decide-whether-at-t-and-time-warner-can-merge-1528832942?mod=article_inline\">anticompetitive leverage</a> against its rivals or more muscle to force higher prices.</p>\n<p>Justice Department officials continued to believe the lawsuit was justified, arguing Judge Leon ignored <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/doj-says-judge-ignored-economics-common-sense-in-allowing-at-t-time-warner-deal-1533585058?mod=article_inline\">economics and common sense</a>.</p>\n<p>The D.C. Circuit, in siding with AT&amp;T on Tuesday, credited Turner&rsquo;s post-lawsuit pledge to arbitrate any fee disputes with rivals in case of an impasse. That part of the ruling could have broader ramifications because it highlighted that merger partners facing an antitrust challenge can potentially weaken the government&rsquo;s case by making promises to limit or forgo pricing increases in the near term.</p>\n<p>The court also said the marketplace was becoming more competitive, with streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu making inroads on traditional pay-television services such as AT&amp;T&rsquo;s.</p>\n<p>The appeals court ruling wasn&rsquo;t a full-throated endorsement of Judge Leon&rsquo;s approach. The D.C. Circuit said that the trial judge &ldquo;made some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore.&rdquo; But the panel said that none of Judge Leon&rsquo;s possible errors were substantial enough to undermine his decision in AT&amp;T&rsquo;s favor.</p>\n<p>The 34-page decision focused heavily on the particular facts of the case, and the panel said it wasn&rsquo;t making new law that insulated vertical mergers from challenge. Such deals can create an array of harms other than higher prices, &ldquo;including decreased product quality and reduced innovation,&rdquo; the court said. But in the AT&amp;T case, the Justice Department presented insufficient evidence to carry the day, it said.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has continued to question whether the department had political motivations for suing, in light of President Trump&rsquo;s pledge as a candidate that he would block the deal if he won the White House.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department denied that politics played any role. That issue wasn&rsquo;t part of the case, as Judge Leon cut off the company&rsquo;s ability to raise the matter.</p>\n<p>After completing the Time Warner acquisition last summer, AT&amp;T rebranded the assets as WarnerMedia.</p>\n<p>The telecom giant is planning a WarnerMedia streaming service for later this year, and the unit&rsquo;s initial performance for AT&amp;T has been strong, in part because of box-office successes at the Warner Bros. studio division.</p>\n<p>But there also have been challenges, including a continuing carriage dispute with <a href=\"https://quotes.wsj.com/DISH\">Dish Network</a> that has resulted in a blackout of HBO on the satellite service as well as Dish&rsquo;s streaming product, Sling TV.</p>\n<p>Dish was a critic of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s Time Warner acquisition and testified at trial for the Justice Department. The post-trial standoff marked the first time <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hbo-and-cinemax-arent-available-on-dish-network-due-to-a-dispute-1541051079?mod=article_inline\">HBO has ever gone dark</a> on a pay-television provider.</p>\n<p>Dish blamed the merger for the blackout, while HBO accused Dish of being unreasonable, rejecting the claim that AT&amp;T&rsquo;s new ownership role caused the impasse.</p>\n<p><strong>Write to </strong>Brent Kendall at <a href=\"mailto:brent.kendall@wsj.com\">brent.kendall@wsj.com</a></p>",

That part of the ruling could have broader ramifications because it highlighted that merger partners facing an antitrust challenge can potentially weaken the government\u2019s case by making promises to limit or forgo pricing increases in the near term.\nThe court also said the marketplace was becoming more competitive, with streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu making inroads on traditional pay-television services such as AT&T\u2019s.\nThe appeals court ruling wasn\u2019t a full-throated endorsement of Judge Leon\u2019s approach. The D.C. Circuit said that the trial judge \u201cmade some problematic statements, which the government identifies and this court cannot ignore.\u201d But the panel said that none of Judge Leon\u2019s possible errors were substantial enough to undermine his decision in AT&T\u2019s favor.\nThe 34-page decision focused heavily on the particular facts of the case, and the panel said it wasn\u2019t making new law that insulated vertical mergers from challenge. Such deals can create an array of harms other than higher prices, \u201cincluding decreased product quality and reduced innovation,\u201d the court said. But in the AT&T case, the Justice Department presented insufficient evidence to carry the day, it said.\nAT&T has continued to question whether the department had political motivations for suing, in light of President Trump\u2019s pledge as a candidate that he would block the deal if he won the White House.\nThe Justice Department denied that politics played any role. That issue wasn\u2019t part of the case, as Judge Leon cut off the company\u2019s ability to raise the matter.\nAfter completing the Time Warner acquisition last summer, AT&T rebranded the assets as WarnerMedia.\nThe telecom giant is planning a WarnerMedia streaming service for later this year, and the unit\u2019s initial performance for AT&T has been strong, in part because of box-office successes at the Warner Bros. studio division.\nBut there also have been challenges, including a continuing carriage dispute with Dish Network that has resulted in a blackout of HBO on the satellite service as well as Dish\u2019s streaming product, Sling TV.\nDish was a critic of AT&T\u2019s Time Warner acquisition and testified at trial for the Justice Department. The post-trial standoff marked the first time HBO has ever gone dark on a pay-television provider.\nDish blamed the merger for the blackout, while HBO accused Dish of being unreasonable, rejecting the claim that AT&T\u2019s new ownership role caused the impasse.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",
