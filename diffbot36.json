                "html": "<p>iStock</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission gave Staples the green light to buy one of the two wholesalers that sell to independent office supply dealers. The decision, passed by a party-line 3-2 vote, hardly made a blip in the news cycle. But it sheds enormous insight into the origins of the big-get-bigger U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>Small and independent businesses have been disappearing in this country for long enough that their decline has come to seem inevitable. And indeed, it often is treated that way in media stories and policy debates. Many economists assure us that small businesses are simply not as efficient as big ones, and point to their demise as evidence that this collective belief is correct. But like so many of the stories we&rsquo;re told about the economy, this one doesn&rsquo;t hold up under exposure to reality. There&rsquo;s something else driving the eradication of independent businesses: The government is systematically structuring markets so that that even the most competitive ones face almost impossibly long odds.</p>\n<p>The office supply industry is a perfect case study. Despite the pervasiveness of Staples and Amazon, independent dealers account for about 20 to 25 percent of the market, according to the National Office Products Alliance. There are hundreds scattered across the country. There&rsquo;s probably one in your area, though you wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily know it, because these dealers generally do not have storefronts. Most office supplies are purchased not by individuals, but by companies, government agencies, school districts, and the like. To serve these customers, independent dealers rely on sales representatives, warehouses, and delivery trucks.</p>\n<p>These businesses are significant to local economies. Many employ a few dozen or a few hundred people. &ldquo;I have drivers who&rsquo;ve worked for me for 30-plus years,&rdquo; said Kim Leazer, who owns Forms &amp; Supply, Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re also highly competitive. Most have offered next-day delivery for 30 years or more, and many have had e-commerce since before Amazon existed. They routinely win contracts from school districts and mid-sized companies, evidence of their ability to beat larger rivals on price. According to one <a href=\"https://www.opsoftware.com/OP/docs/AmazonPricingComparison.pdf\">study</a>, had a California school district purchased supplies from Amazon Business&mdash;Amazon&rsquo;s business- and government-facing platform&mdash;rather than its local independent office dealer, the district would have paid about 10 percent more. And the independents offer a high level of service and customization. &ldquo;My driver will put the paper by the copy machine even if it&rsquo;s on the third-floor,&rdquo; Leazer added.</p>\n<p>In short, there&rsquo;s nothing inherent in their size that keeps these independent businesses from competing against the giants on quality and cost. Which brings us back to the Staples merger.</p>\n<p>There are only two office-supply wholesalers in the U.S.: Essendant and S.P. Richards. For independent office supply dealers, those two firms are their only tethers to the supply chain. Now the FTC has let Staples (and its parent company, the private equity firm Sycamore Partners) buy Essendant, taking control of one of those lifelines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They have given our biggest competitor ownership of our biggest supplier,&rdquo; said David Guernsey, who started Guernsey, Inc., a Virginia-based office supply company, more than 45 years ago. &ldquo;We have never been exposed to anything like this before.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One big risk for independent dealers is that this merger will allow Staples to crawl inside their businesses and look around. That&rsquo;s because Essendant does more than ship products to these dealers; it&rsquo;s intimately involved in their operations. When a dealer is competing for a contract, for example, Essendant often knows the details of the bid, including the service terms the dealer is offering to set itself apart. And it knows its pricing, because dealers typically work closely with Essendant to secure the best prices from manufacturers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If I were [Staples] bidding against [an independent dealer] for one of these deals, I&rsquo;d love to have that information,&rdquo; said Guernsey.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Dealers are rightfully concerned this data will be weaponized against them,&rdquo; noted Rohit Chopra, one of the two dissenting FTC commissioners. The majority did not dispute his assessment, writing in their decision that &ldquo;Staples would gain access to the competitively sensitive information of Essendant&rsquo;s dealer customers &hellip; which could enable Staples to engage in anticompetitive conduct.&rdquo; But rather than block the deal, the FTC imposed a flimsy remedy, ordering Sycamore Partners to set up a &ldquo;firewall&rdquo; between Staples and Essendant.</p>\n<p>Many in the industry are skeptical that a firewall is enforceable, given the ability of employees to share information verbally. Indeed, the idea of a &ldquo;firewall&rdquo; did not even originate with the FTC. Sandy Douglas, the CEO of Staples, floated the idea last fall as opposition to the merger gained momentum.</p>\n<p>A second risk is that Staples will raise the prices that Essendant charges independent dealers, who would then have to pass the increases along to their customers. Faced with higher prices, some of these customers might switch to Staples. Remarkably, the FTC majority insists this won&rsquo;t happen because Staples is not a significant player in the market for these customers, who are mostly mid-sized businesses and local government agencies. Yet Staples, which saw its revenue in North America plunge 10 percent between 2013 and 2016 as consumers flocked to Amazon, has been openly going after these very customers. &ldquo;Staples Inc. is overhauling its marketing as part of a high-stakes pivot away from what it was built on&mdash;selling low-priced office supplies at big stores&mdash;and toward a stronger focus on selling a wide range of products and services to businesses,&rdquo; Bloomberg reported in 2017. Buying Essendant appears to be part of this strategy.</p>\n<p>The FTC also insists that the ability of independent dealers to switch to the one remaining independent wholesaler, S.P. Richards, will keep Staples from abusing its power over them. For an office supply dealer, though, switching wholesalers is less like swapping toothpastes and more like undergoing a kidney transplant. S.P. Richards can absorb only so many dealers at a time, and it doesn&rsquo;t have a presence in every region of the country. Even if it did, the FTC, established by Congress to safeguard competition, would be essentially consigning independent dealers to a monopoly supplier, with little leverage to negotiate.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no guarantee that S.P. Richards will remain independent, either. In fact, its parent, Genuine Parts Co., has been looking to offload it. One potential suitor is Office Depot, which is contending with many of the same dynamics as Staples is.</p>\n<p>A third risk is the one that Chopra raised most forcefully in his dissent: the FTC failed to investigate what Sycamore Partners might have in mind for Essendant. Sycamore is a notorious private equity firm that, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, &ldquo;often buys struggling retailers and sells off their most valuable pieces.&rdquo; A recent <a href=\"https://www.retaildive.com/news/the-road-to-bankruptcy/540617/\">study</a> by Retail Dive found that more than 15 percent of retailers acquired by private equity firms over the past 15 years have filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>A final risk, perhaps the most serious, is that this merger will accelerate Amazon&rsquo;s push to dominate the office supply market, including its bid to capture the spending of thousands of cities and school districts, which my organization <a href=\"https://ilsr.org/amazon-and-local-government-purchasing/\">reported</a> on last year. While Staples and Office Depot offer little to differentiate themselves from Amazon among these customers, independent dealers have distinct strengths that Amazon cannot match. Yet the FTC seems happy to weaken them as viable competitors.</p>\n<p>More than anything, the FTC&rsquo;s approval of this merger shows its lack of regard&mdash;arguably even contempt&mdash;for the ecology of industries: the mix of businesses of different sizes, operating from various vantage points, in relationships with one another both cooperative and competitive. A healthy ecology is regenerative and naturally optimizing; a monoculture is not. Another term for this is &ldquo;market structure.&rdquo; Before Robert Bork and the Reagan administration turned antitrust enforcement on its head, a healthy market structure was an important lens for evaluating mergers.</p>\n<p>Today this lens has largely been abandoned in favor making decisions based on narrowly modeling a merger&rsquo;s potential to increase &ldquo;efficiency.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s not clear that even these models can deter the FTC&rsquo;s predilection for approving mergers. &ldquo;I believe that staff identified significant evidence of likely harm to competition,&rdquo; in this merger, wrote Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter in her dissent.</p>\n<p>Slaughter&rsquo;s dissent rightfully situates the approval of this merger in the context of a &ldquo;great debate&rdquo; that is &ldquo;taking place in Washington policy circles and even around the country at family dinner tables&rdquo; about &ldquo;the consequences for America citizens of fewer and more dominant companies controlling large swaths of industries.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That debate has advanced far enough to produce a 3-2 decision in a case that might have been 5-0 not that long ago. But it must advance even further, and quickly, if we are to salvage an economy that includes independent businesses.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I look at the younger people in this industry and I fear for them,&rdquo; says Guernsey. &ldquo;It will be much harder for them to succeed.&rdquo;</p>",

The majority did not dispute his assessment, writing in their decision that \u201cStaples would gain access to the competitively sensitive information of Essendant\u2019s dealer customers \u2026 which could enable Staples to engage in anticompetitive conduct.\u201d But rather than block the deal, the FTC imposed a flimsy remedy, ordering Sycamore Partners to set up a \u201cfirewall\u201d between Staples and Essendant.\nMany in the industry are skeptical that a firewall is enforceable, given the ability of employees to share information verbally. Indeed, the idea of a \u201cfirewall\u201d did not even originate with the FTC. Sandy Douglas, the CEO of Staples, floated the idea last fall as opposition to the merger gained momentum.\nA second risk is that Staples will raise the prices that Essendant charges independent dealers, who would then have to pass the increases along to their customers. Faced with higher prices, some of these customers might switch to Staples. Remarkably, the FTC majority insists this won\u2019t happen because Staples is not a significant player in the market for these customers, who are mostly mid-sized businesses and local government agencies. Yet Staples, which saw its revenue in North America plunge 10 percent between 2013 and 2016 as consumers flocked to Amazon, has been openly going after these very customers. \u201cStaples Inc. is overhauling its marketing as part of a high-stakes pivot away from what it was built on\u2014selling low-priced office supplies at big stores\u2014and toward a stronger focus on selling a wide range of products and services to businesses,\u201d Bloomberg reported in 2017. Buying Essendant appears to be part of this strategy.\nThe FTC also insists that the ability of independent dealers to switch to the one remaining independent wholesaler, S.P. Richards, will keep Staples from abusing its power over them. For an office supply dealer, though, switching wholesalers is less like swapping toothpastes and more like undergoing a kidney transplant. S.P. Richards can absorb only so many dealers at a time, and it doesn\u2019t have a presence in every region of the country. Even if it did, the FTC, established by Congress to safeguard competition, would be essentially consigning independent dealers to a monopoly supplier, with little leverage to negotiate.\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that S.P. Richards will remain independent, either. In fact, its parent, Genuine Parts Co., has been looking to offload it. One potential suitor is Office Depot, which is contending with many of the same dynamics as Staples is.\nA third risk is the one that Chopra raised most forcefully in his dissent: the FTC failed to investigate what Sycamore Partners might have in mind for Essendant. Sycamore is a notorious private equity firm that, according to the Wall Street Journal, \u201coften buys struggling retailers and sells off their most valuable pieces.\u201d A recent study by Retail Dive found that more than 15 percent of retailers acquired by private equity firms over the past 15 years have filed for bankruptcy.\nA final risk, perhaps the most serious, is that this merger will accelerate Amazon\u2019s push to dominate the office supply market, including its bid to capture the spending of thousands of cities and school districts, which my organization reported on last year. While Staples and Office Depot offer little to differentiate themselves from Amazon among these customers, independent dealers have distinct strengths that Amazon cannot match. Yet the FTC seems happy to weaken them as viable competitors.\nMore than anything, the FTC\u2019s approval of this merger shows its lack of regard\u2014arguably even contempt\u2014for the ecology of industries: the mix of businesses of different sizes, operating from various vantage points, in relationships with one another both cooperative and competitive. A healthy ecology is regenerative and naturally optimizing; a monoculture is not. Another term for this is \u201cmarket structure.\u201d Before Robert Bork and the Reagan administration turned antitrust enforcement on its head, a healthy market structure was an important lens for evaluating mergers.\nToday this lens has largely been abandoned in favor making decisions based on narrowly modeling a merger\u2019s potential to increase \u201cefficiency.\u201d And it\u2019s not clear that even these models can deter the FTC\u2019s predilection for approving mergers. \u201cI believe that staff identified significant evidence of likely harm to competition,\u201d in this merger, wrote Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter in her dissent.\nSlaughter\u2019s dissent rightfully situates the approval of this merger in the context of a \u201cgreat debate\u201d that is \u201ctaking place in Washington policy circles and even around the country at family dinner tables\u201d about \u201cthe consequences for America citizens of fewer and more dominant companies controlling large swaths of industries.\u201d\nThat debate has advanced far enough to produce a 3-2 decision in a case that might have been 5-0 not that long ago. But it must advance even further, and quickly, if we are to salvage an economy that includes independent businesses.\n\u201cI look at the younger people in this industry and I fear for them,\u201d says Guernsey. \u201cIt will be much harder for them to succeed.\u201d",

Either way, if <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/senate-republicans-trump-national-emergency-border-1189065\">reporting</a> on Vice President Mike Pence&rsquo;s Tuesday meeting with the Senate GOP Caucus is accurate, there could be more support on a percentage-basis when the resolution is taken up in the Senate.</p>\n<p>One of the most vocal critics of the administration in that meeting was Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is known for his libertarian family brand.

I think this will even be true among Republican voters in Republican primaries. It may not feel that way right now. In fact, I&rsquo;m sure these conservative lawmakers are being strongly encouraged by their supportive constituents to back and defend Donald Trump against his detractors. In the end, though, I suspect that there will be almost no penalty for having bucked Trump after he is gone. Trump&rsquo;s role in the party will be scrubbed even more thoroughly than George W.

                "html": "<p>iStock</p>\n<p>What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people&mdash;who will already pass enormous economic and social capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)&mdash;are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?</p>\n<p>Paying half a million dollars&ndash;or in one case, $1.2 million&mdash;and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html\">charged</a> 50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kids spots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tier schools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople.</p>\n<p>Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barring some sort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children&rsquo;s only path to success and sustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities.</p>\n<p>The main story at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat&mdash;and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford a scheme like that. But the <em>motivations </em>behind this crime are the same that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of money spent on a cottage industry around preparing students for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or posh secondary schools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges.</p>\n<p>But this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It&rsquo;s not exactly clear why these parents didn&rsquo;t just bribe schools the legal way: write a big check to the school at the same time their kids were applying. (See, for example, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/12/college-admissions-scam-kushner-harvard-acceptance-under-scrutiny/3147027002/\">Jared Kushner</a>.) As our Editor in Chief Paul Glastris <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/433840-washington-monthly-editor-paul-glastris-on-college-admission-cheating\">said</a> Wednesday morning on Hill TV, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in the school.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>Washington Monthly editor-in-chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/glastris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@glastris</a> says college admissions scam is an &quot;illustration&quot; of higher education problems. <a href=\"https://t.co/vUdBwvoXs3\">https://t.co/vUdBwvoXs3</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RsQOv2piYW\">pic.twitter.com/RsQOv2piYW</a></p> <p>&mdash; HILLTV (@HillTVLive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillTVLive/status/1105873453494734848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfare story that I think has stronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent.</p>\n<p>Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that&rsquo;s not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools&rsquo; attention. Kushner&rsquo;s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today&rsquo;s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, the <a href=\"http://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/never-mind-1-percent-lets-talk-about-001-percent\">income cutoff</a> for the top 1 percent was $386,000, seven times the national median. The top .01 percent&rsquo;s was $7 million, eighteen times larger.</p>\n<p>This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvard <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/harvard-gets-largest-ever-donation-1410148865\">received </a>an individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/business/philip-knight-of-nike-to-give-400-million-to-stanford-scholars.html\">$400 million</a> individual donation. It might be safe to say that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child&rsquo;s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe these schools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits.</p>\n<p>This scandal is indicative of the state of higher education these days&mdash;overly obsessed with the most selective schools that don&rsquo;t actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed students <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/shut-up-about-harvard/\">don&rsquo;t go</a> to elite schools. But the way our economic system is set up, there&rsquo;s good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages these schools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into the schools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It&rsquo;s a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.</p>",

                "text": "iStock\nWhat kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people\u2014who will already pass enormous economic and social capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)\u2014are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?\nPaying half a million dollars\u2013or in one case, $1.2 million\u2014and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutors charged 50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kids spots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tier schools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople.\nTheir kids have every advantage in the world. Barring some sort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children\u2019s only path to success and sustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities.\nThe main story at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat\u2014and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford a scheme like that. But the motivations behind this crime are the same that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of money spent on a cottage industry around preparing students for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or posh secondary schools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges.\nBut this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It\u2019s not exactly clear why these parents didn\u2019t just bribe schools the legal way: write a big check to the school at the same time their kids were applying. (See, for example, Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul Glastris said Wednesday morning on Hill TV, \u201cIt\u2019s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in the school.\u201d\nWashington Monthly editor-in-chief @glastris says college admissions scam is an \"illustration\" of higher education problems. https://t.co/vUdBwvoXs3 pic.twitter.com/RsQOv2piYW\n\u2014 HILLTV (@HillTVLive) March 13, 2019\nWhile this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfare story that I think has stronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent.\nHalf a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that\u2019s not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools\u2019 attention. Kushner\u2019s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today\u2019s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, the income cutoff for the top 1 percent was $386,000, seven times the national median. The top .01 percent\u2019s was $7 million, eighteen times larger.\nThis yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvard received an individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a $400 million individual donation. It might be safe to say that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child\u2019s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe these schools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits.\nThis scandal is indicative of the state of higher education these days\u2014overly obsessed with the most selective schools that don\u2019t actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed students don\u2019t go to elite schools. But the way our economic system is set up, there\u2019s good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages these schools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into the schools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It\u2019s a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.",

                "html": "<p>Anthony Crider/Flickr</p>\n<p>Alt-right members preparing to enter Emancipation Park holding Nazi, Confederate, and Gadsden &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; flags.</p>\n<p>When a person makes the decision to kill dozens to draw attention to their political ideas, our first instinct is to ignore them and refuse to listen. Elevating their ideas only gives them what they want and encourages further attacks. But when ever larger numbers of violent incidents arise from people with the same ideology, it behooves us to treat those ideas and those who promulgate them with the appropriate level of attentive alarm.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, I have read (or at least skimmed) the manifesto of the white supremacist terrorist who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-shooting.html\">murdered</a> dozens of Muslims peacefully assembled in prayer at mosques yesterday in New Zealand. But you don&rsquo;t have to, because there&rsquo;s nothing in that document that isn&rsquo;t already mainstreamed in the discourse of Breitbart, alt-right Trump supporters, QAnon conspiracy forums, the broader right-wing memeverse, and Fox News anchors like Tucker Carlson. The only difference is that while most modern conservatives modify their language in the form of vague threats or promises of disenfranchisement, expulsion, and political oppression of minorities and people of color, terrorists like the New Zealand killer put those ideas into immediate, murderous action.</p>\n<p>While much has already been written about the terrorist&rsquo;s idolization of various conservative figures, from Republican President Donald Trump to Tea Party USA head Candace Owens, we should pay more attention to his rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Central to both the killer&rsquo;s ideology and that of the mainstream conservative movement is the notion of &ldquo;replacement.&rdquo; This idea of <em>replacement</em> is a slight but significant shift from white supremacist concerns of the past.</p>\n<p>The preservation of the white race has long been a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/adam-serwer-madison-grant-white-nationalism/583258/\">central piece</a> of far-right ideology, usually expressed in terms of fear of race mixing. Traditionally, white supremacist ideology has been more aligned with maintaining the &ldquo;purity&rdquo; and dominance of whatever changing ethnic subgroupings happened to be coded as &ldquo;white&rdquo; in a given era. Certainly, in the context of slavery and Jim Crow, whites were fearful of slave revolts and labor competition from African-Americans.</p>\n<p>But the modern experience of far-right racism has even more existential overtones because of a combination of declining white birth rates and increasing immigration. The intense fear among an alarming number of white people has caused violent white supremacy to increasingly overlap with mainstream conservative rhetoric. Many have come to fear the slow elimination of <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/whiteness-is-a-racial-construct-its-time-to-take-it-apart/article32301637/\">this false construct</a> we call &ldquo;whiteness&rdquo; through gradual demographic replacement. It was only in the 1980s that neo-nazi ideology <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Words\">started adopting</a> the 14 words explicitly invoking the very &ldquo;existence&rdquo; of white people and the protection of white children.</p>\n<p>Those who value whiteness as an existential identity treat this apparent decline as an existential threat. Those arrogant enough to believe that western democratic ideals are culturally&mdash;or, even more preposterously, biologically&mdash;coded into whiteness and will disappear if the white population declines believe that human freedom depends on demographic preservation. White evangelicals&mdash;the ones who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/01/02/walls-around-trump-are-crumbling-evangelicals-may-be-his-last-resort/?utm_term=.b5b248acddcb\">constitute</a> Trump&rsquo;s most unshakeable base&mdash;have been taught to believe that white protestant America represents puritan John Winthrop&rsquo;s &ldquo;city on a hill,&rdquo; the last keeper of the true Christian faith, the &ldquo;moral and religious people&rdquo; without whom John Adams believed the Constitution could not be preserved. As they decline in numbers, so they believe, God himself disappears from the face of the earth until Judgment Day.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss this stuff as the province of cranks. But the challenge is that the same logic has found its way into the Republican Party. To one extent or another, it&rsquo;s entered many conservative parties in the developed world. Conservative parties see themselves facing a much more real demographic challenge than even the imagined fears of the racists they have courted.</p>\n<p>It was not always so. For a long time, an uneasy balance of power was maintained through an alliance of economic progressives with rural conservatives. On the other side were economic traditionalists who, despite favoring preserving the privileges of capital and wealth, were also open to more cosmopolitan social values.</p>\n<p>As left parties slowly embraced <em>both</em> economic <em>and</em> social equality in the west, the artificial advantages accruing especially to poorer whites began to fade away. As right parties used the the left&rsquo;s embrace of social equity to corner the market on disaffected racists, and as the fall of communism saw the elevation of increasingly deregulated capitalism as a virtually unchallenged ideology outside of China, their electoral dominance stripped away the protections upon which the white middle class had long depended.</p>\n<p>The simultaneous economic suffocation of the previously protected white working and middle classes, alongside its <em>perceived </em>threat from immigration and birth rate patterns, served to radicalize increasing numbers. But crucially, it also neatly aligned conservative parties with racists&mdash;and aligned their existentially pessimistic rhetoric as well.</p>\n<p>The Republican Party (conservative parties abroad face similar trends) is now increasingly a whites-only party. Combined with the gradual decline of white demographic majorities in America, this creates an increasingly desperate reality: the party must either expand and adapt, or die. Its racist base won&rsquo;t allow it to expand and adapt. So it has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@barrymauer.uff/the-new-age-of-eliminationism-in-america-a-conversation-with-david-neiwert-and-barry-mauer-in-ea472876bff6\">chosen</a> a third path: eliminationism and totalitarianism.</p>\n<p>Fox News and Donald Trump now consistently blare the bullhorn of &ldquo;invasions&rdquo; from Mexico and elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a26840336/president-trump-invasion-new-zealand-manifesto/\">directly echoing</a> the shooter&rsquo;s manifesto.

Advisors like Steve Bannon <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/steve-bannon-racist-comments-silicon-valley-inaccurate\">respond</a> to the presence of Asian corporate executives by saying that &ldquo;When two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think . . . a country is more than an economy. We&rsquo;re a civic society.&rdquo; The Commerce Secretary <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/14/702185342/commerce-secretary-to-face-lawmakers-in-hearing-on-census-citizenship-question\">adds questions </a>about citizenship so that immigrants will be afraid to take the census. Non-white immigrants who make the grave mistake of casting a ballot <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/illegal-voting-gets-texas-woman-8-years-in-prison-and-certain-deportation.html\">get years</a> in prison while Republican politicians who actively steal elections don&rsquo;t get so much as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-harris-campaign-operative-indicted-in-north-carolina-election-fraud-case\">an indictment</a>. Fox News host Tucker Carlson <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/fox-news-tucker-carlson-claims-immigration-advocates-are-telling-americans-1245946\">explicitly claims</a> that Democrats want to replace white people.</p>\n<p>When these legal channels of soft ethnic cleansing don&rsquo;t do the trick, the rhetoric of violence begins to creep in. The President <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/opinions/trumps-thuggish-threat-of-violence-against-his-critics-lockhart/index.html\">threatens</a> that his military and police supporters will get tough and ugly if he doesn&rsquo;t get his way. Republican candidates <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/16/sharron-angle-floated-2nd_n_614003.html\">threaten</a> &ldquo;Second Amendment remedies.&rdquo; Republican candidates pose with assault rifles and brag that they&rsquo;ll (illegally and violently) personally deport immigrants in their own trucks.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-united-states-right-wing-violence-is-on-the-rise/2018/11/25/61f7f24a-deb4-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?utm_term=.c06278e42e7f\">incidents</a> of right-wing eliminationist violence are skyrocketing.

                "text": "Anthony Crider/Flickr\nAlt-right members preparing to enter Emancipation Park holding Nazi, Confederate, and Gadsden \"Don't Tread on Me\" flags.\nWhen a person makes the decision to kill dozens to draw attention to their political ideas, our first instinct is to ignore them and refuse to listen. Elevating their ideas only gives them what they want and encourages further attacks. But when ever larger numbers of violent incidents arise from people with the same ideology, it behooves us to treat those ideas and those who promulgate them with the appropriate level of attentive alarm.\nWith that in mind, I have read (or at least skimmed) the manifesto of the white supremacist terrorist who murdered dozens of Muslims peacefully assembled in prayer at mosques yesterday in New Zealand. But you don\u2019t have to, because there\u2019s nothing in that document that isn\u2019t already mainstreamed in the discourse of Breitbart, alt-right Trump supporters, QAnon conspiracy forums, the broader right-wing memeverse, and Fox News anchors like Tucker Carlson. The only difference is that while most modern conservatives modify their language in the form of vague threats or promises of disenfranchisement, expulsion, and political oppression of minorities and people of color, terrorists like the New Zealand killer put those ideas into immediate, murderous action.\nWhile much has already been written about the terrorist\u2019s idolization of various conservative figures, from Republican President Donald Trump to Tea Party USA head Candace Owens, we should pay more attention to his rhetoric.\nCentral to both the killer\u2019s ideology and that of the mainstream conservative movement is the notion of \u201creplacement.\u201d This idea of replacement is a slight but significant shift from white supremacist concerns of the past.\nThe preservation of the white race has long been a central piece of far-right ideology, usually expressed in terms of fear of race mixing. Traditionally, white supremacist ideology has been more aligned with maintaining the \u201cpurity\u201d and dominance of whatever changing ethnic subgroupings happened to be coded as \u201cwhite\u201d in a given era. Certainly, in the context of slavery and Jim Crow, whites were fearful of slave revolts and labor competition from African-Americans.\nBut the modern experience of far-right racism has even more existential overtones because of a combination of declining white birth rates and increasing immigration. The intense fear among an alarming number of white people has caused violent white supremacy to increasingly overlap with mainstream conservative rhetoric. Many have come to fear the slow elimination of this false construct we call \u201cwhiteness\u201d through gradual demographic replacement. It was only in the 1980s that neo-nazi ideology started adopting the 14 words explicitly invoking the very \u201cexistence\u201d of white people and the protection of white children.\nThose who value whiteness as an existential identity treat this apparent decline as an existential threat. Those arrogant enough to believe that western democratic ideals are culturally\u2014or, even more preposterously, biologically\u2014coded into whiteness and will disappear if the white population declines believe that human freedom depends on demographic preservation. White evangelicals\u2014the ones who constitute Trump\u2019s most unshakeable base\u2014have been taught to believe that white protestant America represents puritan John Winthrop\u2019s \u201ccity on a hill,\u201d the last keeper of the true Christian faith, the \u201cmoral and religious people\u201d without whom John Adams believed the Constitution could not be preserved. As they decline in numbers, so they believe, God himself disappears from the face of the earth until Judgment Day.\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss this stuff as the province of cranks. But the challenge is that the same logic has found its way into the Republican Party. To one extent or another, it\u2019s entered many conservative parties in the developed world. Conservative parties see themselves facing a much more real demographic challenge than even the imagined fears of the racists they have courted.\nIt was not always so. For a long time, an uneasy balance of power was maintained through an alliance of economic progressives with rural conservatives. On the other side were economic traditionalists who, despite favoring preserving the privileges of capital and wealth, were also open to more cosmopolitan social values.\nAs left parties slowly embraced both economic and social equality in the west, the artificial advantages accruing especially to poorer whites began to fade away. As right parties used the the left\u2019s embrace of social equity to corner the market on disaffected racists, and as the fall of communism saw the elevation of increasingly deregulated capitalism as a virtually unchallenged ideology outside of China, their electoral dominance stripped away the protections upon which the white middle class had long depended.\nThe simultaneous economic suffocation of the previously protected white working and middle classes, alongside its perceived threat from immigration and birth rate patterns, served to radicalize increasing numbers. But crucially, it also neatly aligned conservative parties with racists\u2014and aligned their existentially pessimistic rhetoric as well.\nThe Republican Party (conservative parties abroad face similar trends) is now increasingly a whites-only party. Combined with the gradual decline of white demographic majorities in America, this creates an increasingly desperate reality: the party must either expand and adapt, or die. Its racist base won\u2019t allow it to expand and adapt. So it has chosen a third path: eliminationism and totalitarianism.\nFox News and Donald Trump now consistently blare the bullhorn of \u201cinvasions\u201d from Mexico and elsewhere, directly echoing the shooter\u2019s manifesto. When neo-nazis chant \u201cYou Will Not Replace Us,\u201d Trump says that \u201cmany of them are good people.\u201d Operatives like Stephen Miller figure out how to disincenvitize non-whites from seeking citizenship. Advisors like Steve Bannon respond to the presence of Asian corporate executives by saying that \u201cWhen two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think . . . a country is more than an economy. We\u2019re a civic society.\u201d The Commerce Secretary adds questions about citizenship so that immigrants will be afraid to take the census. Non-white immigrants who make the grave mistake of casting a ballot get years in prison while Republican politicians who actively steal elections don\u2019t get so much as an indictment. Fox News host Tucker Carlson explicitly claims that Democrats want to replace white people.\nWhen these legal channels of soft ethnic cleansing don\u2019t do the trick, the rhetoric of violence begins to creep in. The President threatens that his military and police supporters will get tough and ugly if he doesn\u2019t get his way. Republican candidates threaten \u201cSecond Amendment remedies.\u201d Republican candidates pose with assault rifles and brag that they\u2019ll (illegally and violently) personally deport immigrants in their own trucks.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that incidents of right-wing eliminationist violence are skyrocketing. They\u2019re simply acting on the same logic and implied rhetoric of the conservative parties they have come to dominate.",

                "html": "<p>Gage Skidmore/Flickr</p>\n<p>Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have been suggesting for a long time that his mental status will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president&rsquo;s behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health.</p>\n<p>The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump&rsquo;s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehner <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/03/trump-tweets-attack-john-mccain/585193/\">refers to the president</a> as &ldquo;a damaged soul with a disordered personality.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump&rsquo;s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better&mdash;and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses&hellip;</p> <p>Whether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we <em>do </em>know is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead.</p> <p>Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president&rsquo;s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump&rsquo;s lies.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man&rsquo;s condition of mind.</p> <p>&mdash; George Conway (@gtconway3d) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1105988372751892480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 14, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Conway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107985551221813249\">tweeted</a> the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, &ldquo;Tell us, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump\"><b>@realDonaldTrump</b></a>&mdash;which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?&rdquo; To explain, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107992501770686470\">tweeted a link</a> to an article in Rolling Stone titled, &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump&rsquo;s Behavior?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"550\"> <p>Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americans should be thinking seriously *now* about Trump&rsquo;s mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress&mdash;and the Vice President and Cabinet. <a href=\"https://t.co/OoxgLJpltE\">https://t.co/OoxgLJpltE</a></p> <p>&mdash; George Conway (@gtconway3d) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1107601427545899008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Jennifer Rubin <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/18/trump-is-getting-worse-republicans-rationalizations-are-getting-weaker/?utm_term=.459f4fce7379\">joined</a> the bandwagon.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein&rsquo;s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump&rsquo;s firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump&rsquo;s mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president&rsquo;s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump&rsquo;s cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>",

                "text": "Gage Skidmore/Flickr\nGiven what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have been suggesting for a long time that his mental status will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president\u2019s behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health.\nThe most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump\u2019s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehner refers to the president as \u201ca damaged soul with a disordered personality.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump\u2019s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better\u2014and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses\u2026\nWhether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we do know is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead.\nDonald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe.\nLeading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president\u2019s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump\u2019s lies.\nWhether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man\u2019s condition of mind.\n\u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) March 14, 2019\nConway tweeted the diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, \u201cTell us, @realDonaldTrump\u2014which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?\u201d To explain, he tweeted a link to an article in Rolling Stone titled, \u201cTrump\u2019s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump\u2019s Behavior?\u201d\nAt one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern.\nAgree with this, but would add that *all* Americans should be thinking seriously *now* about Trump\u2019s mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress\u2014and the Vice President and Cabinet. https://t.co/OoxgLJpltE\n\u2014 George Conway (@gtconway3d) March 18, 2019\nJennifer Rubin joined the bandwagon.\nWhether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein\u2019s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump\u2019s firing of James B. Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump\u2019s mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president\u2019s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration.\nThese are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump\u2019s cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it\u2019s too late.",

                "html": "<p>Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons</p>\n<p>In February 2017, Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina&rsquo;s 7th congressional district introduced the Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act. Devin Nunes is listed as one of the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1179/actions\">65 co-sponsors</a> of the bill.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1179\">summary</a> of what the bill would have done if it had been signed into law.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise requirements concerning citizen suits. Litigation costs (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) must be awarded to the prevailing party, thus the bill removes a court&rsquo;s discretion to award the fees. A prevailing party is defined as the party that prevails on more than half of the claims at issue.</p> <p>The bill repeals the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to deny or restrict the use of any area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material when the discharge of those materials would have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.</p> <p>Current law requires compensatory mitigation to replace the loss of aquatic resource functions in a watershed when a permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters has unavoidable impacts on aquatic resources. This bill prohibits government entities from carrying out compensatory mitigation in excess of existing regulatory requirements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The primary purpose of the bill, aside from poisoning the water supply, is to discourage people from suing polluters by assuring that they&rsquo;ll get saddled with the defense&rsquo;s legal fees if they don&rsquo;t prevail in court. That would assuredly eliminate frivolous suits, but it would also eliminate valid ones by heightening the financial investment and risk tolerance required to initiate them.</p>\n<p>In any case, Devin Nunes <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/19/ridiculousness-devin-nunes-suing-devin-nunes-cow-what-it-really-signals/?utm_term=.0a8d07fe29cf\">co-sponsored</a> this bill because he likes getting financial support from polluters and he wanted to sound tough on frivolous law suits for the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort_reform\">tort reform</a>&rdquo; fanatics. Rep. Rice&rsquo;s proposed bill went nowhere. It was referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment where it died. The polluters and right-wing legal lobbyists approvingly noted who co-sponsored it, and that&rsquo;s about all the impact it had.</p>\n<p>But Devin Nunes apparently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/us/politics/devin-nunes-twitter-lawsuit.html\">likes</a> frivolous law suits because he just filed one.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stung by obscene and pointed criticism, Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, has sued Twitter and three users for defamation, claiming the users smeared him and the platform allowed it to happen because of a political agenda.</p> <p>The complaint, which was filed in Henrico County Circuit Court in Virginia on Tuesday, seeks $250 million in damages. In making his case, Mr. Nunes, a loyal ally of President Trump and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, repeated several common Republican complaints that Twitter has repeatedly denied: that it censors Republicans, &ldquo;shadow bans&rdquo; their accounts and actively helps their opponents.</p> <p>Though absorbing criticism comes with the territory for politicians, the complaint described the objectionable tweets from the three users as something &ldquo;that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life.&rdquo;</p> <p>To make his case, he cited a wide variety of tweets that included accusations of criminal misconduct, crude jokes at his expense and relatively banal criticism. The complaint says the tweets &ldquo;falsely stated&rdquo; that Mr. Nunes had brought &ldquo;shame&rdquo; to his family and that he was voted &ldquo;Most Likely to Commit Treason&rdquo; in high school, and that one of them included a cartoon image of a sexual act with Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The complaint lists dozens of other tweets he found insulting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is zero chance that a public figure like Congressman Devin Nunes will prevail in court. But I don&rsquo;t think he can complain if we insist that he pays all the defendants&rsquo; legal costs when he loses his case. After all, what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?</p>",

                "text": "Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia Commons\nIn February 2017, Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina\u2019s 7th congressional district introduced the Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act. Devin Nunes is listed as one of the 65 co-sponsors of the bill.\nHere\u2019s a summary of what the bill would have done if it had been signed into law.\nThis bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise requirements concerning citizen suits. Litigation costs (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) must be awarded to the prevailing party, thus the bill removes a court\u2019s discretion to award the fees. A prevailing party is defined as the party that prevails on more than half of the claims at issue.\nThe bill repeals the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to deny or restrict the use of any area as a disposal site for dredged or fill material when the discharge of those materials would have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.\nCurrent law requires compensatory mitigation to replace the loss of aquatic resource functions in a watershed when a permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into navigable waters has unavoidable impacts on aquatic resources. This bill prohibits government entities from carrying out compensatory mitigation in excess of existing regulatory requirements.\nThe primary purpose of the bill, aside from poisoning the water supply, is to discourage people from suing polluters by assuring that they\u2019ll get saddled with the defense\u2019s legal fees if they don\u2019t prevail in court. That would assuredly eliminate frivolous suits, but it would also eliminate valid ones by heightening the financial investment and risk tolerance required to initiate them.\nIn any case, Devin Nunes co-sponsored this bill because he likes getting financial support from polluters and he wanted to sound tough on frivolous law suits for the \u201ctort reform\u201d fanatics. Rep. Rice\u2019s proposed bill went nowhere. It was referred to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment where it died. The polluters and right-wing legal lobbyists approvingly noted who co-sponsored it, and that\u2019s about all the impact it had.\nBut Devin Nunes apparently likes frivolous law suits because he just filed one.\nStung by obscene and pointed criticism, Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, has sued Twitter and three users for defamation, claiming the users smeared him and the platform allowed it to happen because of a political agenda.\nThe complaint, which was filed in Henrico County Circuit Court in Virginia on Tuesday, seeks $250 million in damages. In making his case, Mr. Nunes, a loyal ally of President Trump and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, repeated several common Republican complaints that Twitter has repeatedly denied: that it censors Republicans, \u201cshadow bans\u201d their accounts and actively helps their opponents.\nThough absorbing criticism comes with the territory for politicians, the complaint described the objectionable tweets from the three users as something \u201cthat no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life.\u201d\nTo make his case, he cited a wide variety of tweets that included accusations of criminal misconduct, crude jokes at his expense and relatively banal criticism. The complaint says the tweets \u201cfalsely stated\u201d that Mr. Nunes had brought \u201cshame\u201d to his family and that he was voted \u201cMost Likely to Commit Treason\u201d in high school, and that one of them included a cartoon image of a sexual act with Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The complaint lists dozens of other tweets he found insulting.\nThere is zero chance that a public figure like Congressman Devin Nunes will prevail in court. But I don\u2019t think he can complain if we insist that he pays all the defendants\u2019 legal costs when he loses his case. After all, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, right?",

                "html": "<p>White House/Wikimedia Commons</p>\n<p>Our system has a big flaw: the attorney general of the United States works for the president rather than at the pleasure of the legislature. This makes it absurdly difficult to deal with a rogue president who is intent on obstructing an investigation into his own criminal conduct. Consider <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/18/politics/mueller-report-white-house-see/\">the following</a> in that context and try to imagine any other defendant being afforded the same privileges:</p>\n<blockquote><p>White House lawyers expect to have an opportunity to review whatever version of Robert Mueller&rsquo;s report Attorney General Bill Barr submits to Congress before it reaches lawmakers and the public, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, setting up a potential political battle over the hotly anticipated document.</p> <p>The attorneys want the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials, the sources said.</p> <p>The White House&rsquo;s review of executive privilege claims are within its legal purview, but could set up a political battle over the perception President Donald Trump is trying to shield certain information from the public about an investigation that has swirled around him since the first day of his presidency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear about how we&rsquo;re supposed to remove a president. There is a trial in the Senate, and if two-thirds of the Senate agrees that the president should not continue in office, then the president is convicted and must step down. While this is a political rather than judicial proceeding, the two are still analogous enough to make comparisons.</p>\n<p>The time for a defendant to see the evidence against them is after they have been indicted. In this case, that would be after, not before, the House of Representatives has voted to impeach the president and bring their case to the Senate. The House has not even initiated a formal impeachment inquiry yet, and the White House is already demanding to see the evidence. But it&rsquo;s worse than that. They&rsquo;re going to prevent the prosecutors from seeing their own evidence in an effort to prevent them from even filing charges in the first place.</p>\n<p>It should be obvious that the White House will see what Mueller has produced the second the public sees it. If Republican members of Congress see the case before the public, they will immediately leak it to the White House. Trump is already going to have an advantage over a normal defendant because he&rsquo;ll be able to begin the fight before any decisions about indictments have been initiated, let alone finalized, and he can do so armed with the same information that the &ldquo;grand jury&rdquo; possesses.</p>\n<p>In any case, the impeachment process in the House is mostly public. The Republicans will have a seat at the table there and will be part of the &ldquo;grand jury.&rdquo; This process is normally kept private for good reasons, including that criminals shouldn&rsquo;t get advance warning about the evidence that is being collected against them lest they take actions to cover their tracks.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been arguing for two years about whether the president can fire the people who are in charge of managing the investigation against him or whether he can pardon people as a reward for failing to cooperate with the investigators. It&rsquo;s mostly agreed that the president is immune from criminal prosecution while in office. These amount to huge shields that protect a president from scrutiny and accountability. When we add in that he can demand to see the evidence before Congress sees it and that he can in some ways limit or control what evidence Congress will see, it gets to be something more than a shield or a barrier. It&rsquo;s a system that just doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>\n<p>I know that it&rsquo;s difficult to find the right solution and that the independent counsel law had its own problems. I also know that the kind of solutions I think might work would require amending the Constitution and are very unlikely to happen. But this system is rife with absurdities and it&rsquo;s an embarrassment for our country.</p>",

                "text": "White House/Wikimedia Commons\nOur system has a big flaw: the attorney general of the United States works for the president rather than at the pleasure of the legislature. This makes it absurdly difficult to deal with a rogue president who is intent on obstructing an investigation into his own criminal conduct. Consider the following in that context and try to imagine any other defendant being afforded the same privileges:\nWhite House lawyers expect to have an opportunity to review whatever version of Robert Mueller\u2019s report Attorney General Bill Barr submits to Congress before it reaches lawmakers and the public, multiple sources familiar with the matter said, setting up a potential political battle over the hotly anticipated document.\nThe attorneys want the White House to have an opportunity to claim executive privilege over information drawn from documents and interviews with White House officials, the sources said.\nThe White House\u2019s review of executive privilege claims are within its legal purview, but could set up a political battle over the perception President Donald Trump is trying to shield certain information from the public about an investigation that has swirled around him since the first day of his presidency.\nLet\u2019s be clear about how we\u2019re supposed to remove a president. There is a trial in the Senate, and if two-thirds of the Senate agrees that the president should not continue in office, then the president is convicted and must step down. While this is a political rather than judicial proceeding, the two are still analogous enough to make comparisons.\nThe time for a defendant to see the evidence against them is after they have been indicted. In this case, that would be after, not before, the House of Representatives has voted to impeach the president and bring their case to the Senate. The House has not even initiated a formal impeachment inquiry yet, and the White House is already demanding to see the evidence. But it\u2019s worse than that. They\u2019re going to prevent the prosecutors from seeing their own evidence in an effort to prevent them from even filing charges in the first place.\nIt should be obvious that the White House will see what Mueller has produced the second the public sees it. If Republican members of Congress see the case before the public, they will immediately leak it to the White House. Trump is already going to have an advantage over a normal defendant because he\u2019ll be able to begin the fight before any decisions about indictments have been initiated, let alone finalized, and he can do so armed with the same information that the \u201cgrand jury\u201d possesses.\nIn any case, the impeachment process in the House is mostly public. The Republicans will have a seat at the table there and will be part of the \u201cgrand jury.\u201d This process is normally kept private for good reasons, including that criminals shouldn\u2019t get advance warning about the evidence that is being collected against them lest they take actions to cover their tracks.\nWe\u2019ve been arguing for two years about whether the president can fire the people who are in charge of managing the investigation against him or whether he can pardon people as a reward for failing to cooperate with the investigators. It\u2019s mostly agreed that the president is immune from criminal prosecution while in office. These amount to huge shields that protect a president from scrutiny and accountability. When we add in that he can demand to see the evidence before Congress sees it and that he can in some ways limit or control what evidence Congress will see, it gets to be something more than a shield or a barrier. It\u2019s a system that just doesn\u2019t make sense.\nI know that it\u2019s difficult to find the right solution and that the independent counsel law had its own problems. I also know that the kind of solutions I think might work would require amending the Constitution and are very unlikely to happen. But this system is rife with absurdities and it\u2019s an embarrassment for our country.",

                "html": "<p>Wikimedia Commons</p>\n<p>Benjamin Netanyahu has always pandered to Israel&rsquo;s darkest forces when it suits his purposes. Before the 2015 election, he warned that Arab-Israeli citizens were &ldquo;voting in droves,&rdquo; accused his opposition of being manipulated by the Americans, and said a Palestinian state would never emerge on his watch. In the days leading up to Tuesday&rsquo;s election, in which he defeated Benny Gantz, Netanyahu demonstrated that he will go to any extreme to protect his grip on power. He <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/dcaac8e4095a4e5ba8dac7f18c767fd8\">vowed</a> to annex the West Bank settlements, which, if implemented, this would kill any viable hope for an eventual two-state solution.</p>\n<p>But his annexation pledge cannot be dismissed as another election-eve attempt to turn out right-wing voters. There&rsquo;s a major difference between 2015 and 2019. Donald Trump is now in the White House.</p>\n<p>In the past, Netanyahu could use American presidents to provide him with the cover necessary to disappoint his base. He could promise something radical, gain right-wing support, and then tell the ultra-nationalist, settler parties in his coalition, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to do this, but I can&rsquo;t risk angering Washington.&rdquo; Those days seem to be over. During a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/politics/pompeo-israel-west-bank.html\">refused</a> to say whether the administration would oppose Israel&rsquo;s unilateral annexation of the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Trump has already done Bibi&rsquo;s bidding. He&rsquo;s moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, cut aid to the Palestinians, and pulled the United States out of the Iran deal. Most recently, the president gave Netanyahu an enormous campaign gift&mdash;recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights&mdash;without getting anything in return. Then, Trump helped Bibi again, designating the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist organization. Standing idle while Netanyahu annexes the settlements would be Trump&rsquo;s logical next step.</p>\n<p>If this plan is carried out, the president&rsquo;s evangelical base would be delighted, but the damage would be irreversible. Israel cannot control Palestinians in the West Bank forever without suffering profound consequences. By extending Israeli sovereignty to territory that should one day constitute a Palestinian state, Netanyahu will force Israel to give up its commitment to remaining both Jewish and democratic&mdash;embroiling the nation even deeper into an existential crisis. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned two years ago that Israel was already on a &ldquo;slippery slope&rdquo; toward apartheid.</p>\n<p>For now, many Israelis don&rsquo;t seem to care. Netanyahu&rsquo;s 10-year premiership has outlasted the 2011 Arab Uprisings, the Syrian civil war, two conflicts in Gaza, and the Great Recession. Throughout a period of global tumult, he has kept Israel relatively stable and secure. He has expanded Israel&rsquo;s diplomatic relations abroad, including with China and India. He has forged quiet relationships with its Sunni Arab neighbors, like Saudi Arabia. And he has overseen Israel&rsquo;s thriving economy, which enjoys an unemployment rate <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/israel/unemployment-rate\">below</a> 4 percent. This short-term success, however, obfuscates the long-term damage he&rsquo;s inflicting on the country. Economic prosperity will mean very little if Israel can no longer remain a Jewish democracy.</p>\n<p>Negotiations are now under way between Netanyahu and smaller right-wing parties as the prime minister looks to form his conservative government. <em>Haaretz </em>has <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-netanyahu-s-next-coalition-annexation-for-immunity-from-indictment-1.7107757\">reported</a> that smaller parties are considering a bill that would prohibit a sitting prime minister from being indicted&mdash;a priority for Netanyahu, who faces multiple charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. In exchange, he would annex the settlements, including isolated outposts.</p>\n<p>If Trump lets him, it will divide world Jewry in ways like never before. As Tom Friedman has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/opinion/president-trump-will-you-save-the-jews.html\">said</a>, the debate about Israel will shift from &ldquo;left versus right&rdquo; to &ldquo;right versus wrong.&rdquo; The partisan split on Capitol Hill will only deepen as progressives lose ammunition for why the state is worth supporting. Israel will no longer be seen as an instrument of Jewish self-determination, but of permanent domination over the Palestinians. And once that happens, there will be no turning back. History will regard Netanyahu and Trump as the symbiotic partners who destroyed the liberal Zionist dream.</p>",

Netanyahu\u2019s 10-year premiership has outlasted the 2011 Arab Uprisings, the Syrian civil war, two conflicts in Gaza, and the Great Recession. Throughout a period of global tumult, he has kept Israel relatively stable and secure. He has expanded Israel\u2019s diplomatic relations abroad, including with China and India. He has forged quiet relationships with its Sunni Arab neighbors, like Saudi Arabia. And he has overseen Israel\u2019s thriving economy, which enjoys an unemployment rate below 4 percent. This short-term success, however, obfuscates the long-term damage he\u2019s inflicting on the country. Economic prosperity will mean very little if Israel can no longer remain a Jewish democracy.\nNegotiations are now under way between Netanyahu and smaller right-wing parties as the prime minister looks to form his conservative government. Haaretz has reported that smaller parties are considering a bill that would prohibit a sitting prime minister from being indicted\u2014a priority for Netanyahu, who faces multiple charges of fraud, bribery, and breach of trust. In exchange, he would annex the settlements, including isolated outposts.\nIf Trump lets him, it will divide world Jewry in ways like never before. As Tom Friedman has said, the debate about Israel will shift from \u201cleft versus right\u201d to \u201cright versus wrong.\u201d The partisan split on Capitol Hill will only deepen as progressives lose ammunition for why the state is worth supporting. Israel will no longer be seen as an instrument of Jewish self-determination, but of permanent domination over the Palestinians. And once that happens, there will be no turning back. History will regard Netanyahu and Trump as the symbiotic partners who destroyed the liberal Zionist dream.",

In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/us/politics/16taxday.html\">rally against</a> Big Government, or to write <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/04/15/happy-tax-day-here-are-6-infuriating-ways-the-government-spends-your-money/\">listicles</a> chronicling &ldquo;six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money that <em>doesn&rsquo;t </em>come in. ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted\">estimates</a> that every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service has shed staff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors&mdash;a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigate shady claims or to go after people who don&rsquo;t bother to file taxes. No wonder the department&rsquo;s inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don&rsquo;t pan out to be the straight-forward, belt-tightening measures they&rsquo;re pitched to be.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been two years since we&rsquo;ve hired anyone,&rdquo; one Department of Labor bureaucrat <a href=\"https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/04/07/18-federal-workers-what-its-really-like-to-work-for-the-trump-administration/\">told</a> Rachel Cohen, writing for <em>Washingtonian</em>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost 25 percent of our staff, and our employees know nobody is being hired&mdash;but we&rsquo;re not allowed to admit it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That Trump&rsquo;s bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump&rsquo;s budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff) solicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch &ldquo;from scratch.&rdquo; Mulvaney said that Trump wanted to start with &ldquo;a literal blank piece of paper.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Reinventing Government&rsquo; initiative called for eliminating <a href=\"https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/whoweare/history2.html\">hundreds of thousands</a> of government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W. Bush pressed for cuts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/04/us/bush-budget-cuts-or-cancels-school-programs-drug-centers-and-air-traffic-changes.html\">too</a>. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening; sometimes it&rsquo;s making government more competent. Often, it&rsquo;s both. But simply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hiring freezes&mdash;not only in terms of explicit policy but also the struggle to hire when the budget is so uncertain&mdash;these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government&rdquo; said Donald Kettl, a political scientist at University of Texas at Austin. When staff are cut in government, agencies still have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration can&rsquo;t not send out checks. The IRS can&rsquo;t not collect taxes.</p>\n<p>Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelman <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaugust-2017/trumps-plan-to-make-government-older-more-expensive-and-more-dysfunctional/\">showed</a> that while the U.S. population has ballooned since the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about the same size as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to be <a href=\"https://www.pogo.org/report/2011/09/bad-business-billions-of-taxpayer-dollars-wasted-on-hiring-contractors/\">more costly</a> than civil servants, sometimes dramatically so, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn&rsquo;t always save taxpayer money.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also vital that the government have enough staff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don&rsquo;t. When the U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, it <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchapril-2011/more-bureaucrats-please/\">dramatically increased</a> the cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A government <a href=\"https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/contingency/reports/docs/gansler_commission_report_final_report_20071031.pdf\">report</a> found that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increased seven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weapons systems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they&rsquo;re overseeing for extra manpower&mdash;in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing&rsquo;s assistance in inspecting and approving the company&rsquo;s own planes. That policy of delegation has come under scrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing&rsquo;s 737 Max 8 jets. &ldquo;It seems pretty clear that the FAA didn&rsquo;t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,&rdquo; says Kettl.</p>\n<p>But this problem isn&rsquo;t just limited to the executive branch. It&rsquo;s an issue for Congress, too. As I <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/april-may-june-2019/how-congress-got-dumb-on-tech-and-how-it-can-get-smart/\">wrote</a> for the most recent issue of the <em>Monthly</em>, legislators&rsquo; struggles with technology can be traced back to staffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and their staff on science and technology. They cut a third of staffers in the House who work on committees&mdash;where much of the policymaking happens. And they cut support agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter.</p>\n<p>Those numbers haven&rsquo;t rebounded, and current staffers feel it. A recent <a href=\"http://congressfoundation.org/storage/documents/CMF_Pubs/cmf-state-of-the-congress.pdf\">survey</a> of senior aides found that 84 percent thought &ldquo;high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch&rdquo; was &ldquo;very important,&rdquo; while just 24 percent were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the status quo.</p>\n<p>With fewer policy and research staff available, and without in-house science and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue to struggle to understand some of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff. While they&rsquo;re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS&mdash;and help recoup billions in the process.</p>",

The IRS can\u2019t not collect taxes.\nEnter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelman showed that while the U.S. population has ballooned since the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about the same size as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to be more costly than civil servants, sometimes dramatically so, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn\u2019t always save taxpayer money.\nIt\u2019s also vital that the government have enough staff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don\u2019t. When the U.S. went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, it dramatically increased the cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A government report found that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increased seven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weapons systems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009.\nSometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they\u2019re overseeing for extra manpower\u2014in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing\u2019s assistance in inspecting and approving the company\u2019s own planes. That policy of delegation has come under scrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing\u2019s 737 Max 8 jets. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that the FAA didn\u2019t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,\u201d says Kettl.\nBut this problem isn\u2019t just limited to the executive branch. It\u2019s an issue for Congress, too. As I wrote for the most recent issue of the Monthly, legislators\u2019 struggles with technology can be traced back to staffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and their staff on science and technology. They cut a third of staffers in the House who work on committees\u2014where much of the policymaking happens. And they cut support agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter.\nThose numbers haven\u2019t rebounded, and current staffers feel it. A recent survey of senior aides found that 84 percent thought \u201chigh-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch\u201d was \u201cvery important,\u201d while just 24 percent were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the status quo.\nWith fewer policy and research staff available, and without in-house science and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue to struggle to understand some of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff. While they\u2019re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS\u2014and help recoup billions in the process.",

Scholten crisscrossed Iowa&rsquo;s Fourth District, talking to local farmers who are getting squeezed by giant agribusinesses.</p>\n<p>The midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm &ldquo;blue wave&rdquo; since Watergate. But, second, those Democratic supporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidates still lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama&rsquo;s 2012 performance. As a result, Democrats <i>lost</i> two net Senate seats. The Senate map in 2020 is only slightly less foreboding, as statewide races in heavily rural states like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotas seem to slip ever further out of reach.</p>\n<p>There was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a &ldquo;rising electorate&rdquo; of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may be swinging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites&mdash;and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing <i>much</i> better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.</p>\n<p>Mindful of this reality, many Democratic strategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs a strategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combine small-bore ideas that are insufficient to the scale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump&rsquo;s agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on.</p>\n<p>While the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by &ldquo;economic anxiety&rdquo; has been thoroughly debunked, there&rsquo;s no denying that America&rsquo;s agricultural communities have been starkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming, suffering epidemic levels of opioid addiction and suicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way that stoking white cultural grievance never will.</p>\n<p>Just ask J. D. Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America&mdash;and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points&mdash;a swing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural message should be,&rdquo; Scholten says. His answer: &ldquo;Talk about market consolidation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.</p>\n<p>At his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa&rsquo;s Fourth District, Scholten spoke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmers sell, are devastating farm incomes. &ldquo;Agriculture is the backbone of this district,&rdquo; Scholten says. &ldquo;At every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are being squeezed on the input and on the output side. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that&rsquo;s one thing that national reporters never understood.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,&rdquo; he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. &ldquo;Anti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what&rsquo;s happening in the ag business.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Scholten&rsquo;s message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities&rsquo; economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave won&rsquo;t be enough to take back the map.</p>\n<p>If you have heard about the plight of America&rsquo;s farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump&rsquo;s media vortex. You may have seen stories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA. Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump&rsquo;s base. But while Trump&rsquo;s trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America&rsquo;s farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 election saw the sharpest decline in farm incomes since the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming.</p>\n<p>By now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going each season. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers&rsquo; debt-to-income ratios are the highest they&rsquo;ve been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeast sent its members a list of suicide and mental-health hotlines along with their dairy checks.</p>\n<p>As farm income declines, so do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers and seed and feed suppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population, so do local banks, schools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers&rsquo; livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the only substantial source of incoming wealth.</p>\n<p>What is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, and so rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highly skilled &ldquo;knowledge workers&rdquo; who feed off each other&rsquo;s creativity by clustering in elite cities. That&rsquo;s the theme of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealingly <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/countering-the-geography-of-discontent-strategies-for-left-behind-places/\">entitled</a> &ldquo;Strategies for Left-Behind Places.&rdquo; It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has &ldquo;increasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters of skills and firms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those &ldquo;talent-laden clusters.&rdquo; It suggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody&rsquo;s fault&mdash;it&rsquo;s the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted.</p>\n<p>Well, here&rsquo;s a different take&mdash;one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality isn&rsquo;t technology; it&rsquo;s changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies to strip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America&rsquo;s snazziest zip codes.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolized sellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for the supplies they need, like seed and fertilizer. At the same time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy the stuff they sell, like crops and livestock.</p>\n<p>Start with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top four seed companies controlled only 21 percent of the global seed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come a shocking increase in the cost of seed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA data shows that the per-acre cost of soybean and corn seed spiked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively.</p>\n<p>Today&rsquo;s seeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that doesn&rsquo;t translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modified seed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their own seeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishing selection of seed strains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to the same corporations. Since 2017, the Big Six seed and agrichemical companies have shrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased their share to more than two-thirds.</p>\n<p>As crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. &ldquo;[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay for seed corn before he&rsquo;ll go switch to some other company,&rdquo; says Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t like what Mycogen is charging for seed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but there&rsquo;s only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of difference in prices.&rdquo; That is, of course, when there are even multiple sellers to choose from.</p>\n<p>The same story holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to today, with the steepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated by several international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that price swings in these markets were due to oligopolistic behavior.</p>\n<p>All together, the average farmer spends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when he started farming. At that time, he sold corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. &ldquo;So, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?&rdquo; Hansen <a href=\"http://nebraskafarmersunion.org/corn-prices-1973-2017/\">asked</a> in a message to NFU members. &ldquo;The honest answer is that it does not work.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It does work, though, for the seed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted record seed sales and profits in 2017. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had a boom while farmers have gone broke,&rdquo; says Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets.</p>\n<p>Even as monopolization means that farmers pay more for the supplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce.</p>\n<p>Nationally, the top four beef packers slaughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that&rsquo;s up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of all soybeans; today those same four process 85 percent. These statistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. &ldquo;Today you&rsquo;ll find that in most all this country, really, there&rsquo;s just one buyer,&rdquo; says Maxwell. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they all sat in a room somewhere and carved the country up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Courtesy of J. D. Scholten for Congress</p>\n<p>Taking a stand against Big Ag: J. D. Scholten, left, made taming the agricultural monopolies a central theme of his campaign to win over voters like Iowa farmer Charles Rasmussen.</p>\n<p>This degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If there&rsquo;s a single statistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumers <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=iclFAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA11&lpg=RA3-PA11&dq=farmers+share+of+the+food+dollar+1980s&source=bl&ots=jVG3Si4lbN&sig=lyOhU8ea58Ap1IdVC34rOyxGcMU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiw7br0-7XeAhXIx1kKHVubDD8Q6AEwE3oECAIQAQ#v=onepage&q=farmers%2520share%2520of%2520the%2520food%2520dollar%25201980s&f=false\">spent</a> a dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers <a href=\"https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17885\">receive</a> less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers and simultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products.</p>\n<p>The same story repeats across agricultural sectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias says its chicken farmer members haven&rsquo;t seen an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grew steadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finally slowing and then slightly declining over the past three years.</p>\n<p>As Big Ag cuts farmers&rsquo; margins, often the only way farmers can see to stay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of &ldquo;confined animal feeding operations,&rdquo; or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, as some farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confined spaces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expanding sections of rural America.</p>\n<p>When Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, he seemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immiserating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novdec-2012/obamas-game-of-chicken/\">promised</a> to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers.</p>\n<p>Early in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, and seed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power to stand up to abuses by ag monopolies.</p>\n<p>But the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon, sixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDA saying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason his secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders that stripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finally signed off on a significantly watered-down rule change. But shortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue shot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA&rsquo;s antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency.</p>\n<p>So it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopoly seriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses they suffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing for solutions that fail to acknowledge the party&rsquo;s own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in the <i>New York Times</i> shortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomasky <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/opinion/midterm-democrats-election-2020.html\">recommended</a> that the party embrace a &ldquo;four pillar&rdquo; plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things, spending more money on opioid addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers&rsquo; markets, and directing more payments to farmers who set aside land for conservation. But Vilsack&rsquo;s plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers&rsquo; misery, let alone any strategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group.</p>\n<p>Other plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind of social Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and then propose solutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategies for Left-Behind Places,&rdquo; for example, states flatly that it would be &ldquo;inefficient to &lsquo;save&rsquo; every left-behind small city or rural community in the U.S.&rdquo; It then argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks, some targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programming skills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, thereby allowing more heartlanders to move to those thriving metropolises&mdash;a solution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, it stops short of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of the solution.</p>\n<p>Big Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large and small, are available at every level of government to politicians who want to show their solidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouraging start is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commission studies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details, <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/january-february-march-2019/three-ways-democrats-can-fix-the-farm-economy/\">see</a> &ldquo;The Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy&rdquo; by Adam Diamond.)</p>\n<p>Smaller-scale but still substantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly in still another way, by reforming so-called &ldquo;checkoff&rdquo; programs. These are federally sponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating that schools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly.</p>\n<p>In the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it&rsquo;s less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers.</p>\n<p>Advocating for such policies could appeal to a far broader set of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now become so extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban and suburban consumers by forcing farmers into a system of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, poses substantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide.</p>\n<p>Taking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to do something important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the current system. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalized when a single agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions.</p>\n<p>Rural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo; banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut off service to &ldquo;flyover country&rdquo;; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandoning service to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep.</p>\n<p>J. D. Scholten also points to how large chain stores like Dollar General &ldquo;sink money out of the community&rdquo; by shutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. &ldquo;Part of that rural identity is being independent,&rdquo; argues Scholten. &ldquo;Now [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than being self-employed, and I think that&rsquo;s part of the issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the face of such challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation&rsquo;s growing economic and political divides should stop listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead they should pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing to say it out loud.</p>",

                "text": "Courtesy of J. D. Scholten for Congress\nGrain of truth: In his bid to unseat Republican Congressman Steve King, J. D. Scholten crisscrossed Iowa\u2019s Fourth District, talking to local farmers who are getting squeezed by giant agribusinesses.\nThe midterm elections made two things very clear about Democratic voters in the Donald Trump era. First, they vastly outnumber Republican voters: Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives and won the popular vote by more than eight percentage points, the biggest midterm \u201cblue wave\u201d since Watergate. But, second, those Democratic supporters are geographically clustered in a way that wastes millions of their votes. While the party improved its margins among rural voters compared to 2016, its candidates still lost by a whopping fourteen to eighteen percentage points outside of metro areas, lagging well behind Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 performance. As a result, Democrats lost two net Senate seats. The Senate map in 2020 is only slightly less foreboding, as statewide races in heavily rural states like Iowa, Missouri, and the Dakotas seem to slip ever further out of reach.\nThere was a time in the very recent past when many on the left were confident that an era of Democratic dominance was just around the corner, the inevitable result of a \u201crising electorate\u201d of younger, better educated, and more diverse voters. The midterms were a wake-up call. The rising electorate may be swinging left, but there has been an equal reaction among older and less educated whites\u2014and they represent a lot more of the political map. Without doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.\nMindful of this reality, many Democratic strategists are rightly warning that the party desperately needs a strategy to win back rural voters. Unfortunately, the most prominent plans tend to combine small-bore ideas that are insufficient to the scale of the problem (like more money for rural broadband) with attacks on Trump\u2019s agricultural tariffs, which Trump-supporting farmers actually tend to give the president a pass on.\nWhile the notion that all Trump voters are motivated by \u201ceconomic anxiety\u201d has been thoroughly debunked, there\u2019s no denying that America\u2019s agricultural communities have been starkly declining for years-struggling to turn profits through farming, suffering epidemic levels of opioid addiction and suicide. Democrats thus have both an opportunity and a moral obligation to try to win these voters back by offering policies that will improve their livelihoods in a way that stoking white cultural grievance never will.\nJust ask J. D. Scholten. The thirty-eight-year-old former minor league baseball player garnered national attention in November for almost unseating Iowa Representative Steve King, an eight-term Republican incumbent in one of the reddest districts in America\u2014and perhaps the most unabashed racist in Congress. The last Democrat to run against King lost by 22.6 percent; in 2016, the district went for Trump by twenty-seven points. Yet Scholten lost by only 3.4 percentage points\u2014a swing from 2016 that, if it could be replicated nationally, would all but wipe out the current incarnation of the Republican Party. How did he do it?\n\u201cI have a lot of folks calling me thinking of running for president and they want to know what their rural message should be,\u201d Scholten says. His answer: \u201cTalk about market consolidation.\u201d\nWithout doing much better among voters outside of metro areas, Democrats have little hope of regaining the Senate for years, maybe decades, to come, and may even continue to lose the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.\nAt his thirty-nine town hall meetings, across every county in Iowa\u2019s Fourth District, Scholten spoke about improving the economy by addressing the growing power of agribusiness monopolies, which, by raising prices on what farmers buy and pushing down prices of what farmers sell, are devastating farm incomes. \u201cAgriculture is the backbone of this district,\u201d Scholten says. \u201cAt every [town hall] I talked about how farmers are being squeezed on the input and on the output side. . . . That resonated more than tariffs ever did, and I think that\u2019s one thing that national reporters never understood.\n\u201cI think farmers view tariffs as temporary, whereas market consolidation is a long-term issue,\u201d he adds, noting that the call for fair competition has bipartisan appeal. \u201cAnti-trust . . . has not been a partisan issue. Traditional Republicans, they want competitive markets, and that goes against what\u2019s happening in the ag business.\u201d\nScholten\u2019s message on agribusiness monopolies may have resonated with farmers, but it has not yet broken through with big-city liberals, too many of whom write off the possibility that progressive economic populism could appeal to rural voters more than right-wing cultural warfare. Until Democratic leaders and candidates find their voice on the key issue affecting rural communities\u2019 economic fortunes, even the biggest blue wave won\u2019t be enough to take back the map.\nIf you have heard about the plight of America\u2019s farmers, it was likely in the context of Trump\u2019s media vortex. You may have seen stories about dairy farms closing because Trump made a fuss about Canadian dairy markets while renegotiating NAFTA. Or you know that China aimed retaliatory tariffs at farmers to target Trump\u2019s base. But while Trump\u2019s trade policies have certainly made matters worse for many farmers, they are hardly the prime cause for the full-blown crisis gripping America\u2019s farm economy. Farming communities have been dwindling for decades. The three years leading up to the 2016 election saw the sharpest decline in farm incomes since the Great Depression. In 2015, more than half of all farm households lost more money than they made farming.\nBy now, many observers are predicting that we are on the verge of a farm crisis more dangerous than the one that ripped rural America apart in the 1980s. The downturn is particularly devastating for grain and dairy farmers, who rely on large annual operating loans to keep going each season. After four to five years of losing money on every acre of grain or gallon of milk, these farms have exhausted their credit lines. Farmers\u2019 debt-to-income ratios are the highest they\u2019ve been in three decades. Wisconsin alone has lost 1,100 dairy farms over the past two years. One large dairy co-op in the Northeast sent its members a list of suicide and mental-health hotlines along with their dairy checks.\nAs farm income declines, so do whole regions. First, local equipment dealers and seed and feed suppliers close. Then, with the decline in economic activity and eventual loss of population, so do local banks, schools, and hospitals. Most people in rural America are not farmers, but in traditionally ag-dependent regions, even non-farmers\u2019 livelihoods depend, directly or indirectly, on farm income, which is often the only substantial source of incoming wealth.\nWhat is behind the accelerating decline? One popular idea in elite quarters is that the plight of rural America was foreordained by technological change. As agriculture becomes more productive, the thinking goes, we need fewer farmers, and so rural communities naturally depopulate. Meanwhile, a digitized, global economy naturally gives the highest reward to highly skilled \u201cknowledge workers\u201d who feed off each other\u2019s creativity by clustering in elite cities. That\u2019s the theme of a recent report by the Brookings Institution, revealingly entitled \u201cStrategies for Left-Behind Places.\u201d It concludes that the growing gap between elite cities and rural America is the inevitable result of digital technology, which has \u201cincreasingly rewarded the most talent-laden clusters of skills and firms.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a narrative that appeals to many experts, who not coincidentally live in those \u201ctalent-laden clusters.\u201d It suggests that the plight of Left-Behind Places is nobody\u2019s fault\u2014it\u2019s the result of an impersonal evolutionary process that just happens to favor coastal elites while crushing the maladapted.\nWell, here\u2019s a different take\u2014one that has far more resonance in heartland America and is backed up by overwhelming evidence. The biggest cause of growing regional inequality isn\u2019t technology; it\u2019s changes in public policy, embraced by both parties, that have enabled predatory monopolies to strip wealth away from farmers and rural communities and transfer it to America\u2019s snazziest zip codes.\nHere\u2019s how it works. Farmers are caught between monopolized sellers and buyers. They must pay ever higher prices to the giants who dominate the market for the supplies they need, like seed and fertilizer. At the same time, they must accept ever lower prices from the giant agribusinesses that buy the stuff they sell, like crops and livestock.\nStart with how corporate concentration affects the prices farmers pay. In 1994, the top four seed companies controlled only 21 percent of the global seed market. By 2013, just the top three controlled 55 percent, with Monsanto alone controlling more than a quarter. With that increase in concentration has come a shocking increase in the cost of seed, because these giants face little pressure to compete on price. USDA data shows that the per-acre cost of soybean and corn seed spiked dramatically between 1995 and 2014, by 351 percent and 321 percent, respectively.\nToday\u2019s seeds are often genetically modified to produce higher yields, but that doesn\u2019t translate into more net income for the farmers. Not only is the cost of genetically modified seed high, but patent monopolies often make it illegal for farmers to use a portion of their crops to produce their own seeds, as most did in the past. Moreover, even as farmers are paying monopoly prices for a diminishing selection of seed strains produced by handful of giant corporations, they also are paying monopoly prices for fertilizers and pesticides, often to the same corporations. Since 2017, the Big Six seed and agrichemical companies have shrunk to four, after Dow merged with DuPont and Bayer purchased Monsanto. The top four producers of nitrogen fertilizer controlled 34 percent of the market in 1977, but by 2015 had increased their share to more than two-thirds.\nAs crop prices fall and farmers look for areas to cut back on the cost of inputs, many feel up against a wall. \u201c[Seed companies] figure out, how much will a farmer actually pay for seed corn before he\u2019ll go switch to some other company,\u201d says Nebraska farmer Vern Jantzen. \u201cIf I don\u2019t like what Mycogen is charging for seed corn I can go to Pioneer and I can go to Dekalb, but there\u2019s only three guys. If they all kind of talk to each other a little bit, there isn\u2019t a whole lot of difference in prices.\u201d That is, of course, when there are even multiple sellers to choose from.\nThe same story holds for chemicals used in agriculture, whose prices roughly tripled from 1990 to today, with the steepest increases after 2007. The fertilizer market is dominated by several international phosphorous and potash cartels, and a 2013 monograph by the American Antitrust Institute made the case that price swings in these markets were due to oligopolistic behavior.\nAll together, the average farmer spends three times more on inputs per acre today than in the 1990s. Recently, the president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, John Hansen, looked up the corn prices from 1973, when he started farming. At that time, he sold corn for $3.30 a bushel; in 2017 the average price per bushel was $3.33. \u201cSo, how does it work to live and farm in 2017 and pay for those 2017 costs with 1973 prices?\u201d Hansen asked in a message to NFU members. \u201cThe honest answer is that it does not work.\u201d\nIt does work, though, for the seed and chemical companies. Before their acquisition by Bayer and recent legal trouble, Monsanto touted record seed sales and profits in 2017. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a boom while farmers have gone broke,\u201d says Joe Maxwell, who is a farmer, former lieutenant governor of Missouri, and executive director of the Organization for Competitive Markets.\nEven as monopolization means that farmers pay more for the supplies they need, it also means that they receive less for the food they produce.\nNationally, the top four beef packers slaughtered 25 percent of cows in 1977; today that\u2019s up to 84 percent. As recently as 1990, four companies processed 61 percent of all soybeans; today those same four process 85 percent. These statistics actually understate the problem, because at the local level, dominant agribusinesses often have total monopolies. \u201cToday you\u2019ll find that in most all this country, really, there\u2019s just one buyer,\u201d says Maxwell. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they all sat in a room somewhere and carved the country up.\u201d\nCourtesy of J. D. Scholten for Congress\nTaking a stand against Big Ag: J. D. Scholten, left, made taming the agricultural monopolies a central theme of his campaign to win over voters like Iowa farmer Charles Rasmussen.\nThis degree of corporate concentration has turned farmers into price takers. If there\u2019s a single statistic that captures the plight of rural America, it is this: In the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents out of that dollar went back to the farmer. Today, farmers receive less than 15 cents on every dollar. The difference is increasingly flowing to powerful and concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers. In 2016, the big meat-packer Smithfield openly bragged about how its record profits were due to a fourteen-year low in the prices paid to hog farmers and simultaneously higher consumer prices for packaged pork products.\nThe same story repeats across agricultural sectors, from grains and produce to eggs and poultry. The Contract Poultry Growers Association of the Virginias says its chicken farmer members haven\u2019t seen an increase in base pay for the past twenty years. Nor do consumers benefit. Chicken and turkey retail prices grew steadily over the last decade, by 19 percent and 47 percent from 2007 to 2013, respectively, before finally slowing and then slightly declining over the past three years.\nAs Big Ag cuts farmers\u2019 margins, often the only way farmers can see to stay in business is to try making it up on volume. This is what accounts for the emergence of \u201cconfined animal feeding operations,\u201d or CAFOs, in which thousands of animals are crammed together in inhumane conditions. CAFOs reflect the ruinous competition farmers face with one another. They also pose a massive threat to human health, as some farmers routinely use nontherapeutic antibiotics on animals crowded into confined spaces, producing antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And they cause vile pollution from large manure lagoons, further detracting from the quality of life across expanding sections of rural America.\nWhen Barack Obama was competing for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008, he seemed to understand the role that corporate concentration was playing in immiserating much of rural America. Campaigning in Iowa, North Carolina, and Colorado, he promised to take on abuses by monopolistic agribusinesses, particularly meat-packers.\nEarly in his presidency, he followed up on these promises by having top Agriculture Department (USDA) and Justice Department officials hold hearings across the country to investigate malpractice in the poultry, cattle, dairy, and seed industries, as well as the growing gap between the prices consumers paid and farmers received. At the conclusion of these hearings the USDA proposed rule changes that would have given farmers far greater power to stand up to abuses by ag monopolies.\nBut the blowback was immediate. Big Meat threw its lobbying weight behind an effort to block the reforms. Soon, sixty-eight Republicans and forty-seven Democrats delivered a letter to the USDA saying that the new rules were unjustified and required more industry input and economic analysis. Obama could have implemented the rules unilaterally, but for whatever reason his secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, hesitated. Then, in 2010, Republicans took the House and began passing appropriations riders that stripped the USDA of the necessary funds to implement the rules even if they had gone into effect. In December 2016, Vilsack finally signed off on a significantly watered-down rule change. But shortly after President Trump took office, new Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue shot down even these modest reforms and dissolved the USDA\u2019s antitrust agency entirely, burying its duties within the agribusiness-friendly Agricultural Marketing Service agency.\nSo it turns out that the Democrats briefly did have a rural policy that took monopoly seriously, but gave it low priority and retreated in the face of corporate opposition. Today, this record leaves many farmers bitter, especially those who risked retaliation by testifying at the USDA hearings about the abuses they suffered at the hands of monopolists. That bitterness is only amplified when they hear voices in the Democratic Party arguing for solutions that fail to acknowledge the party\u2019s own role in fostering agribusiness monopolies. Writing in the New York Times shortly after the election, columnist Michael Tomasky recommended that the party embrace a \u201cfour pillar\u201d plan written by Tom Vilsack, which calls for, among other things, spending more money on opioid addiction treatment, encouraging more local farmers\u2019 markets, and directing more payments to farmers who set aside land for conservation. But Vilsack\u2019s plan pointedly fails to mention a central cause of American farmers\u2019 misery, let alone any strategies for taking on the agribusiness monopolies he failed to roll back during his time in office. Perhaps not coincidentally, Vilsack is currently the president and CEO of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, an agribusiness lobbying group.\nOther plans circulating in Democratic quarters embrace a kind of social Darwinism to explain the growth of regional inequality and then propose solutions that are almost insulting in their inadequacy and implicit victim blaming. Brookings Institution\u2019s \u201cStrategies for Left-Behind Places,\u201d for example, states flatly that it would be \u201cinefficient to \u2018save\u2019 every left-behind small city or rural community in the U.S.\u201d It then argues that the best that can be done is to offer displaced farmers and rural workers more broadband networks, some targeted federal economic development programs, and training in programming skills. The report concludes by calling for changes to zoning laws that would produce more affordable housing in high-cost cities like New York and San Francisco, thereby allowing more heartlanders to move to those thriving metropolises\u2014a solution that would, of course, only exacerbate the problem of coastal population clustering. Though the report does mention rising monopoly as a cause of regional inequality, it stops short of recommending anti-monopoly measures as part of the solution.\nBig Ag would obviously oppose any Democratic effort to win in rural America with an anti-monopoly playbook. But policy levers, large and small, are available at every level of government to politicians who want to show their solidarity with ordinary voters in rural communities. The big policy levers include things like busting up ag monopolies and reforming giant food co-ops. An encouraging start is a pair of complementary bills, introduced by Senator Cory Booker and Representative Mark Pocan, both Democrats, that would put an eighteen-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers while a new commission studies ways to improve competition policy enforcement. (For more details, see \u201cThe Three Ways Democrats Can Fix the Farm Economy\u201d by Adam Diamond.)\nSmaller-scale but still substantive measures include legislation that would prevent meat-packers from vertically integrating into owning livestock or forcing farmers into exploitative contracts. Booker and Republican Senator Mike Lee introduced an amendment to the farm bill that would have addressed agricultural monopoly in still another way, by reforming so-called \u201ccheckoff\u201d programs. These are federally sponsored programs that collect money from farmers to market their product but that often wind up financing agribusiness lobbying groups (The amendment failed, but did draw thirty-eight votes from across both parties.) At the local level, mandating that schools use more locally grown food in their cafeterias is one available weapon for combating agribusiness monopoly.\nIn the 1980s, when American consumers spent a dollar on food, 37 cents went back to the farmer. Today, it\u2019s less than 15 cents. The difference is increasingly flowing to concentrated agribusinesses, middlemen, and retailers.\nAdvocating for such policies could appeal to a far broader set of Americans than just farmers. One reason is that monopolization in agriculture has by now become so extreme that even as it drives down prices for farmers, it can also drive up prices for consumers. This reality has been reinforced by recent investigations into price fixing at tuna companies, mega-brewers, dairy co-ops, chicken processors, and pork packers. Monopolization also affects urban and suburban consumers by forcing farmers into a system of industrial-scale monoculture that lacks resiliency in the face of climate change, poses substantial human health and environmental threats, and produces a level of cruelty to animals that more and more Americans can no longer abide. Though rural and urban Americans may differ on many cultural wedge issues, their common victimization by monopolists provides an issue that bridges the divide.\nTaking on agribusiness monopolies also provides a way to do something important for farm and food chain workers exploited under the current system. Many of the people who pick our food and cut our meats, whether they are undocumented immigrants, refugees, people of color, or working-class whites, are further marginalized when a single agricultural giant controls all the jobs available to them across whole regions.\nRural communities are also deeply oppressed by other forms of monopoly. These include the closing of local hospitals bought out by giant corporate chains; the takeover of locally owned financial institutions by taxpayer-subsidized \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks; the loss of connectivity to the global economy that results when airlines cut off service to \u201cflyover country\u201d; and the threats posed by deregulated freight railroad monopolies that are abandoning service to farms and industries along branch lines while charging monopoly prices on the mainline traffic they keep.\nJ. D. Scholten also points to how large chain stores like Dollar General \u201csink money out of the community\u201d by shutting down locally owned retailers. Restoring antitrust enforcement across the board, including against companies like Walmart and Amazon, would go a long way toward allowing local economies to once again compete on an even playing field. \u201cPart of that rural identity is being independent,\u201d argues Scholten. \u201cNow [rural communities] are reliant on a corporation rather than being self-employed, and I think that\u2019s part of the issue.\u201d\nIn the face of such challenges and opportunities, leaders interested in addressing the nation\u2019s growing economic and political divides should stop listening to people who think we can fix the problems of rural America with more broadband, coding classes, and zoning changes. Instead they should pay attention to people like Scholten who know what they are talking about and are willing to say it out loud.",

That case, in short, is this: Too many people are buying too many health care services with other people&rsquo;s money. The key to controlling health care spending, according to this view, is to give individuals &ldquo;skin in the game&rdquo;&mdash;that is, financial incentives to be more prudent health care consumers.</p>\n<p>This theory underlies virtually all of the GOP proposals floating around Washington, including House Speaker Paul Ryan&rsquo;s plan, revealed in February, to &ldquo;repeal and replace&rdquo; Obamacare and transform Medicaid. The basic idea is to limit the federal government&rsquo;s role (and financial stake) in health care by shifting more of the costs and burdens onto individuals via measures such as high-deductible health care plans. Make health care &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; feel at least some of the pain of paying for their care, the thinking goes, and they will shop for better deals and stop demanding care they don&rsquo;t need. This, in turn, will force providers to be more efficient, reduce their prices, stop pushing unnecessary care, and thus lower the nation&rsquo;s health care bill.</p>\n<p>Republicans are right about the desperate need to control health care spending, which is eating away at both the federal budget and the livelihoods of individual Americans. But their theory of change rests on a peculiar vision of human nature, which, not to put too fine a point on it, assumes that most Americans are hypochondriacs. While we all know somebody who fits that description, most of us are actually not eager to hand our bodies over to be punctured with needles, probed with instruments, and cut open with scalpels. We do so only when the pain gets bad enough or when our doctors say we should. And when it comes to making health care purchasing decisions, our own judgment isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best guide. A recent study of workers whose Fortune 500 employer switched them to a high-deductible health insurance plan found that employees never learned to do price comparisons, and while they reduced their health care spending, they did so not only by cutting back on wasteful services like unneeded CT scans, but also by forgoing necessary care, such as a follow-up visit after a diagnosis of diabetes.</p>\n<p>Even if policy changes could somehow make Americans savvier medical consumers, the effect on overall health care costs would be surprisingly small. That&rsquo;s because the vast majority of Americans aren&rsquo;t big users of the health care system. Rather, statistics show that 5 percent of the population accounts for fully 50 percent of all health care spending, and 20 percent of individuals consume fully 80 percent.</p>\n<p>Who are these people? They are our elderly parents, whose health is slowly deteriorating and who need help coping with their worsening illnesses. They are younger people, most of them still working, who suffer from multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of these patients have mental health problems that make it a challenge for them and their doctors and families to deal with their chronic physical ailments. These are people who, almost by definition, can&rsquo;t use their purchasing power to fix an out-of-control health care market, because they rapidly spend down their deductibles on necessary care, leaving the bulk of the cost to be paid by insurance. These folks have plenty of skin in the game&mdash;their own skin.</p>\n<p>The real source of our spending problem is not a nation of hypochondriacs, nor even the sickest 5 percent of Americans. It&rsquo;s our sick health care system. American medicine is the best in the world at &ldquo;acute care,&rdquo; saving the lives of victims of car accidents and heart attacks. But it is remarkably bad at caring for people with chronic conditions, whose symptoms can be controlled but rarely cured and who require routine help in managing their health. Without that help, they will inevitably be hit with sudden health crises that leave them nowhere to go but the emergency room and the hospital. And that&rsquo;s the most expensive place to treat them.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons American health care is doing such a bad job, one of them being the way insurers&mdash;both private companies and Medicare and Medicaid&mdash;pay for the majority of the care we receive. Most doctors and hospitals are paid on a &ldquo;fee-for-service&rdquo; basis; that is, they charge a fee for each individual office visit, test, drug, minor procedure, major surgery, and hospitalization. This means that the more patients a primary care doctor sees in a day, the more she makes; the more stuff that gets done to patients in a hospital, the higher its revenue. Providers are rewarded for delivering more care, not better care. Fee-for-service has made it difficult for even the most ambitious and well-meaning hospitals, clinics, and clinicians to transform their practices to provide the routine, largely low-tech, often home-based care the 5 percent really needs.</p>\n<p>In this <i>Washington Monthly</i> special report<i>, </i>we offer four examples of health care programs that have walked away from this broken system. They employ &ldquo;low-tech, high-touch care,&rdquo; much of it provided by non-doctors, that not only improves the day-to-day lives of people with chronic illnesses, it also saves money for the government and private insurers. Each takes advantage of an alternative payment model, which opens the door to &ldquo;wraparound&rdquo; care that can keep the sickest 5 percent out of the emergency room and hospital.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay-2017/home-remedy/\">San Diego</a>, the Transitions program, run by Sharp HealthCare, provides extra care at home that helps elderly people who are not yet sick enough for hospice avoid frequent hospitalizations. At <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay-2017/stanfords-big-health-care-idea/\">Stanford</a>, a clinic coordinates doctors, nurses, and medical assistants to care for university employees with multiple chronic illnesses. A &ldquo;health home&rdquo; in <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay-2017/missouri-compromised/\">Missouri</a> makes sure that people with mental illness get the treatment that enables them to manage their physical health challenges. And in <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/novemberdecember-2017/mind-body-connections/\">Pennsylvania</a>, four counties run an innovative program that has dramatically improved the coordination of physical and mental health care for patients with serious mental illness.</p>\n<p>Each of these programs is at risk if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act or tinkers in the wrong way with Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to covering nearly thirty million people who previously had limited or no access to health insurance and adequate care, the ACA supports novel payment schemes that can break the cycle of neglect toward the chronically ill. If these programs are dismantled, or even slowed, we will continue to see rising health care spending&mdash;and worsening health in America. If the GOP is serious about lowering costs, it should reconsider its assumptions about how the health care market works. The lives of millions of American patients, and the financial health of the whole system, are riding on it.</p>",

A recent study of workers whose Fortune 500 employer switched them to a high-deductible health insurance plan found that employees never learned to do price comparisons, and while they reduced their health care spending, they did so not only by cutting back on wasteful services like unneeded CT scans, but also by forgoing necessary care, such as a follow-up visit after a diagnosis of diabetes.\nEven if policy changes could somehow make Americans savvier medical consumers, the effect on overall health care costs would be surprisingly small. That\u2019s because the vast majority of Americans aren\u2019t big users of the health care system. Rather, statistics show that 5 percent of the population accounts for fully 50 percent of all health care spending, and 20 percent of individuals consume fully 80 percent.\nWho are these people? They are our elderly parents, whose health is slowly deteriorating and who need help coping with their worsening illnesses. They are younger people, most of them still working, who suffer from multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of these patients have mental health problems that make it a challenge for them and their doctors and families to deal with their chronic physical ailments. These are people who, almost by definition, can\u2019t use their purchasing power to fix an out-of-control health care market, because they rapidly spend down their deductibles on necessary care, leaving the bulk of the cost to be paid by insurance. These folks have plenty of skin in the game\u2014their own skin.\nThe real source of our spending problem is not a nation of hypochondriacs, nor even the sickest 5 percent of Americans. It\u2019s our sick health care system. American medicine is the best in the world at \u201cacute care,\u201d saving the lives of victims of car accidents and heart attacks. But it is remarkably bad at caring for people with chronic conditions, whose symptoms can be controlled but rarely cured and who require routine help in managing their health. Without that help, they will inevitably be hit with sudden health crises that leave them nowhere to go but the emergency room and the hospital. And that\u2019s the most expensive place to treat them.\nThere are many reasons American health care is doing such a bad job, one of them being the way insurers\u2014both private companies and Medicare and Medicaid\u2014pay for the majority of the care we receive. Most doctors and hospitals are paid on a \u201cfee-for-service\u201d basis; that is, they charge a fee for each individual office visit, test, drug, minor procedure, major surgery, and hospitalization. This means that the more patients a primary care doctor sees in a day, the more she makes; the more stuff that gets done to patients in a hospital, the higher its revenue. Providers are rewarded for delivering more care, not better care. Fee-for-service has made it difficult for even the most ambitious and well-meaning hospitals, clinics, and clinicians to transform their practices to provide the routine, largely low-tech, often home-based care the 5 percent really needs.\nIn this Washington Monthly special report, we offer four examples of health care programs that have walked away from this broken system. They employ \u201clow-tech, high-touch care,\u201d much of it provided by non-doctors, that not only improves the day-to-day lives of people with chronic illnesses, it also saves money for the government and private insurers. Each takes advantage of an alternative payment model, which opens the door to \u201cwraparound\u201d care that can keep the sickest 5 percent out of the emergency room and hospital.\nIn San Diego, the Transitions program, run by Sharp HealthCare, provides extra care at home that helps elderly people who are not yet sick enough for hospice avoid frequent hospitalizations. At Stanford, a clinic coordinates doctors, nurses, and medical assistants to care for university employees with multiple chronic illnesses. A \u201chealth home\u201d in Missouri makes sure that people with mental illness get the treatment that enables them to manage their physical health challenges. And in Pennsylvania, four counties run an innovative program that has dramatically improved the coordination of physical and mental health care for patients with serious mental illness.\nEach of these programs is at risk if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act or tinkers in the wrong way with Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to covering nearly thirty million people who previously had limited or no access to health insurance and adequate care, the ACA supports novel payment schemes that can break the cycle of neglect toward the chronically ill. If these programs are dismantled, or even slowed, we will continue to see rising health care spending\u2014and worsening health in America. If the GOP is serious about lowering costs, it should reconsider its assumptions about how the health care market works. The lives of millions of American patients, and the financial health of the whole system, are riding on it.",

Kelly leaves jail in Chicago after posting bond. He faces 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But R&amp;B superstar R. Kelly seemed immune to the explosive charges that he had sexually abused teenage girls, keeping them like sex slaves in a cultlike setting where they had to ask permission to use the bathroom, often trapped by nondisclosure agreements.</p>\n<p>Then came last month&rsquo;s six-part documentary series on Lifetime, &ldquo;Surviving R. Kelly.&rdquo; Woman after woman faced the camera to tell her harrowing story.</p>\n<p>And suddenly, the walls surrounding the superstar began to tumble down, as a nation of disgusted viewers turned on him, using the hashtag #MuteRKelly &mdash; which had originated in 2017 but now found a whole new life.</p>\n<p>Last year, the streaming music service Spotify had stopped featuring his music. But now, after the Lifetime series, something much bigger happened: His record label, RCA, dropped him.</p>\n<p>And Monday, stunningly, the Grammy-winning singer wore an orange prison jumpsuit for a hearing in a Chicago courtroom after spending the weekend in custody. He had been arrested Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. Of the four alleged victims, three were minors.</p>\n<p>Kelly, who has denied the charges, called the accusers liars and even (last year, through his management ) referred to the &ldquo;attempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I honestly feel zero satisfaction,&rdquo; said Jim DeRogatis, 54, the former music critic of the Chicago Sun-Times who first wrote about Kelly-as-predator in late 2000 and has been doggedly pursuing the story ever since.</p>\n<p>DeRogatis told me by phone Monday that, despite his 18 years of reporting on Kelly, even he was late to it, since he believes Kelly&rsquo;s abuses date back almost three decades.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All of the systems failed &mdash; journalism failed, the police failed, the courts failed, the music industry failed, parents failed,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>So, why did it take so long? And why did a Lifetime docuseries break through when traditional investigative journalism couldn&rsquo;t?</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no simple answer.

Kelly seemed immune to the explosive charges that he had sexually abused teenage girls, keeping them like sex slaves in a cultlike setting where they had to ask permission to use the bathroom, often trapped by nondisclosure agreements.\nThen came last month\u2019s six-part documentary series on Lifetime, \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d Woman after woman faced the camera to tell her harrowing story.\nAnd suddenly, the walls surrounding the superstar began to tumble down, as a nation of disgusted viewers turned on him, using the hashtag #MuteRKelly \u2014 which had originated in 2017 but now found a whole new life.\nLast year, the streaming music service Spotify had stopped featuring his music. But now, after the Lifetime series, something much bigger happened: His record label, RCA, dropped him.\nAnd Monday, stunningly, the Grammy-winning singer wore an orange prison jumpsuit for a hearing in a Chicago courtroom after spending the weekend in custody. He had been arrested Friday on 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse. Of the four alleged victims, three were minors.\nKelly, who has denied the charges, called the accusers liars and even (last year, through his management ) referred to the \u201cattempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\u201d\n\u201cI honestly feel zero satisfaction,\u201d said Jim DeRogatis, 54, the former music critic of the Chicago Sun-Times who first wrote about Kelly-as-predator in late 2000 and has been doggedly pursuing the story ever since.\nDeRogatis told me by phone Monday that, despite his 18 years of reporting on Kelly, even he was late to it, since he believes Kelly\u2019s abuses date back almost three decades.\n\u201cAll of the systems failed \u2014 journalism failed, the police failed, the courts failed, the music industry failed, parents failed,\u201d he said.\nSo, why did it take so long?

But he was acquitted six years later when she declined to testify.\n\u201cWhatever happens now,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s too little, too late for these women to regain their lives.\u201d\nBut, thanks to a powerful TV series and the bravery of women willing to tell their truths, it\u2019s far more likely now that some kind of justice will be done.",

Our little pocket pals seduced us with cheap long distance, unlimited texts, endless apps. Now they beep and shudder and flash with strange numbers at all hours of the day. We answer, and our beloved iPhone (or Android, or bedside landline) impales our eardrum with a cruiseline ad. It tries to sell us a medical back brace. It threatens to jail us unless we wire our life savings to the IRS.</p>\n<p>Spam bots nest in call centers on every continent, spewing out phone calls by the millions, saturating the communication networks. Spam and scams swarm through our phones like Hitchcock&rsquo;s birds down the living-room chimney. There is no escape.</p>\n<p>More than 10 billion robo-calls have been placed so far in 2019, by call-blocking company YouMail&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://robocallindex.com/history/time\">estimate </a>&mdash; almost double the same period a year before. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/19/nearly-half-cellphone-calls-will-be-scams-by-report-says/?tid=lk_inline_manual_4\">Another report</a> by First Orion, the call-blocking and caller-ID tech company, estimates that nearly half of all cellphone calls will be scams at some point this year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It started off two or three a day. As time went by, it went to 50 or 60,&rdquo; said Matt Briscoe, who switched cell-service providers last summer and brought home the telephonic equivalent of a roach-infested couch.</p>\n<p>Briscoe, who runs a <a href=\"https://texastake.com/what-is-texas-take/\">community newspaper</a> in Corpus Christi, Tex., hears from far more spambots than humans these days. On March 11 alone, he declined 44 calls purporting to originate from the 704 area code in Albemarle, N.C. &mdash; which, given the prevalence of number spoofing, probably means the caller is anywhere but Albemarle, N.C.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This thing is just buzzing in my pocket constantly,&rdquo; Briscoe said, shortly before his conversation with The Washington Post was interrupted by his eighth spam call of the morning. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s something that seems odd, I won&rsquo;t answer. If I do, nine times out of 10, it&rsquo;s: &lsquo;Hello! Would you like to be connected to a health insurance specialist?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>He has the voice down pat: the cheerful, soulless &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; of a spambot inviting you into an abyssal call center from which you may never return. You&rsquo;ve probably heard such a voice yourself.</p>\n<p>When Cabot Phillips stepped into the elevator at his apartment building in Alexandria, Va., one evening last month, the elevator was talking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, is anyone there? Can anyone hear me?&rdquo; a muffled<b>, </b>presumably human voice said from inside the emergency speaker. Phillips had assumed the speaker was for the fire department. Now, as he ascended to his home, it seemed to be asking him in broken English for $299 in IT charges.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I knew spam callers were getting innovative, but I just got one through the speaker of an elevator... <a href=\"https://t.co/Lmr7ld7HcY\">pic.twitter.com/Lmr7ld7HcY</a></p>&mdash; Cabot Phillips (@cabot_phillips) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cabot_phillips/status/1096548241007673354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 15, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Dude, you&rsquo;re calling an elevator,&rdquo; Phillips said, and proceeded to his door. He later reflected, &ldquo;I was hoping an elevator was still a sacred location for peace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam. Surely this is spam&rsquo;s most powerful incarnation yet. Earlier outbreaks were at least contained to our email inboxes, or hampered by the relatively primitive telemarketing technology of the past century. Now spam teleports into our purses and nightstands and innermost lives, advertising gastric balloons, demanding debt payments, speaking languages we don&rsquo;t understand. Spam dispatched by fly-by-night ministries even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThoughtsbySophi/status/1105128656056303616\">offers to pray for us.</a></p>\n<p>If you plotted a graph of a phone call&rsquo;s usefulness from Alexander Graham Bell&rsquo;s first in 1876 until today, it would climb steadily through the 20th century, rocket skyward with the advent of mobile phones, and then take a U-turn and slap us around the ears with everything the machines have learned.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve returned right back to where we were in the &rsquo;80s,&rdquo; said Jeffrey A. Hansen, an IT consultant who has testified as an <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10515968513445/Exhibit%20A%20-%20Resume%20of%20Jeffrey%20Hansen.pdf\">expert witness</a> in dozens of consumer lawsuits against robodialers. &ldquo;Same software. The only difference now is computers are exponentially faster. Tens of millions [of calls] versus thousands.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hansen traces the phone spam era back to 1974, when two men in Colorado <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US3943289A/en?oq=3943289\">patented</a> an &ldquo;automatic telephone caller&rdquo; that simply dialed numbers in numerical sequence &mdash; 555-1111, 555-1112 &mdash; and blared a prerecorded message at whomever picked up. The technology improved with cell centers&rsquo; profit margins. By the early 1980s, Computerworld magazine was advertising $13,000<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=u1cLS3rMWSwC&pg=RA2-PA1-IA7&lpg=RA2-PA1-IA7&dq=davox+terminal&source=bl&ots=exuvKeeq9m&sig=ACfU3U12z2p3NuL4aPoflsSAnhNW4c4xRA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_lryTnoThAhXrqlkKHaaaCjkQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=davox%20terminal&f=false\"> Davox terminals</a> that fused a monitor, keyboard and a phone handset into a telemarketer&rsquo;s dream machine. Brrrrring brrrrring!</p>\n<p>In 1991, a committee room full of U.S. senators <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?23630-1/telephone-solicitation#&start=5572\">listened</a> to an answering machine recording that had been annoying people across the country. A disembodied voice boomed over Hawaiian background music: &ldquo;Just think about that, you and a friend or a loved one enjoying the beautiful beaches of Waikiki, and call me at 1-900-321-6666.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Telannoyers,&rdquo; as some called them, were so endemic at the time that Congress passed laws restricting them, followed by the Do Not Call Registry in 2003. For a few years, it seemed like phone spam was contained. Then came the age of cellphones, international VoIP calls and offshore call centers that can mask their location to make it look like they are calling you from down the block. Then came the Trump administration&rsquo;s deregulatory zeal, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-dc-circuit-decision-curbing-regulatory-overreach\">celebrated</a> a 2018 court ruling undoing Obama-era restrictions on autodialers.</p>\n<p>In April, a Senate subcommittee <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=E0EB17D2-A895-40B4-B385-F94EA2716957\">convened once again to discuss</a> the phone-spam crisis. They interrogated a Florida telemarketer named Adrian Abramovich, who was accused of placing nearly 100 million robo-calls with spoofed caller IDs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the kingpin of robo-calling that is alleged,&rdquo; Abramovich protested. &ldquo;I receive four or five robo-calls a day. . . . I&rsquo;ve been receiving more than ever, myself. Usually I never answer the phone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Abramovich had a point; the problem goes far beyond any one person or call center. Despite the government&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/14/foreign-robocallers-could-face-fines-under-fccs-proposed-rules/?utm_term=.0a070af61b8d&tid=lk_inline_manual_45\">$120 million dollar fine</a> against him last May, the call-blocking company Hiya <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2019/03/08/spam-phone-calls-jumped-3x-to-85-billion-last-year-robocalls-at-fault/#484a27187329\">estimates</a> spam calls increased nearly 50 percent in 2018. They come from all corners of the world &mdash; from the marketing departments of major American banks and from clandestine call centers <a href=\"https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/103-long-distance-part-ii\">hidden above bars in Delhi, India.</a></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I got one just the other night,&rdquo; said Margot Saunders, senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center. &ldquo;Someone said, &lsquo;Hello Cathy.&rsquo; I said, there&rsquo;s no Cathy here. A voice said, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s okay. Since I got you . . . .&rsquo; It took a few minutes to figure out I wasn&rsquo;t talking to a real person. It&rsquo;s a robot! There&rsquo;s a company making snippets of recorded voice which operators in India press buttons to implement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Paul Romer got a 6 a.m. call from an unrecognized number at his home in New York last fall, he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/08/two-americans-win-nobel-prize-economics/?utm_term=.8059b7dced2b&tid=lk_inline_manual_51\">assumed it was spam</a> and went back to sleep. He later learned it was from Sweden; he&rsquo;d won the Nobel Prize in economics.</p>\n<p>Courtney Kelsey, 21, made the same mistake when she answered her spam-infested iPhone in St. Louis this month, and the man on the other end struggled to pronounce her name.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I asked him to &mdash; whatever list I&rsquo;m on or wherever they&rsquo;re calling from, could they take me off the list?&rdquo; Kelsey recalled. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t hear you. Is this Courtney?&rsquo; I just hung up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She ignored a second call, blocked the number and only later realized it was from the Ritz-Carlton, where she had applied for a serving job. Kelsey hadn&rsquo;t managed to reschedule the job interview by the time she spoke to The Washington Post last week.</p>\n<p>So it&rsquo;s come to this. We confuse spambots for humans, and humans for spambots. The sci-fi author Charlie Stross once posited a future in which spam becomes so good at mimicking human interaction it becomes self-aware &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/12/its-made-out-of-meat.html\">the &ldquo;Spamularity.</a>&rdquo; Is that what awaits us if the phones don&rsquo;t shut up?</p>\n<p>Saunders, the consumer group lawyer getting spammed by human simulacrums, says the nightmare could be over within months if the telecom giants would invest more in anti-spam technology, which is now spotty at best &mdash; or if the government would force them to (as the FCC&rsquo;s Pai has <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-356187A1.pdf\">now indicated he might</a>). If not, she said, the unsustainable status quo will continue.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Briscoe &mdash; the Texas newspaper publisher besieged with health insurance calls from not-Albemarle, N.C. &mdash; has tried just about every spam-blocking app on the market.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve used RoboKiller. That hasn&rsquo;t worked with this one at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hiya. Truecaller. Mr. Number. Not even close.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In desperation, he once tried staying on the line with the spam, perhaps hoping to plead for his sanity with the promised &ldquo;health insurance specialist.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Instead, he said, an agent asked him for his height, weight, birth date and social security number. When Briscoe asked for an insurance license number, the agent supplied one as fake as whatever $299 anti-virus software is sold in an elevator.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t want no [expletive] insurance anyway,&rdquo; the agent replied and, for a change, hung up on him.</p>",

Now they beep and shudder and flash with strange numbers at all hours of the day. We answer, and our beloved iPhone (or Android, or bedside landline) impales our eardrum with a cruiseline ad. It tries to sell us a medical back brace. It threatens to jail us unless we wire our life savings to the IRS.\nSpam bots nest in call centers on every continent, spewing out phone calls by the millions, saturating the communication networks. Spam and scams swarm through our phones like Hitchcock\u2019s birds down the living-room chimney. There is no escape.\nMore than 10 billion robo-calls have been placed so far in 2019, by call-blocking company YouMail\u2019s estimate \u2014 almost double the same period a year before. Another report by First Orion, the call-blocking and caller-ID tech company, estimates that nearly half of all cellphone calls will be scams at some point this year.\n\u201cIt started off two or three a day. As time went by, it went to 50 or 60,\u201d said Matt Briscoe, who switched cell-service providers last summer and brought home the telephonic equivalent of a roach-infested couch.\nBriscoe, who runs a community newspaper in Corpus Christi, Tex., hears from far more spambots than humans these days. On March 11 alone, he declined 44 calls purporting to originate from the 704 area code in Albemarle, N.C. \u2014 which, given the prevalence of number spoofing, probably means the caller is anywhere but Albemarle, N.C.\n\u201cThis thing is just buzzing in my pocket constantly,\u201d Briscoe said, shortly before his conversation with The Washington Post was interrupted by his eighth spam call of the morning. \u201cIf it\u2019s something that seems odd, I won\u2019t answer. If I do, nine times out of 10, it\u2019s: \u2018Hello! Would you like to be connected to a health insurance specialist?\u2019 \u201d\nHe has the voice down pat: the cheerful, soulless \u201cHello!\u201d of a spambot inviting you into an abyssal call center from which you may never return. You\u2019ve probably heard such a voice yourself.\nWhen Cabot Phillips stepped into the elevator at his apartment building in Alexandria, Va., one evening last month, the elevator was talking.\n\u201cExcuse me, is anyone there? Can anyone hear me?\u201d a muffled, presumably human voice said from inside the emergency speaker. Phillips had assumed the speaker was for the fire department. Now, as he ascended to his home, it seemed to be asking him in broken English for $299 in IT charges.\nI knew spam callers were getting innovative, but I just got one through the speaker of an elevator... pic.twitter.com/Lmr7ld7HcY\n\u2014 Cabot Phillips (@cabot_phillips) February 15, 2019\n\u201cDude, you\u2019re calling an elevator,\u201d Phillips said, and proceeded to his door. He later reflected, \u201cI was hoping an elevator was still a sacred location for peace.\u201d\nSpam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam. Surely this is spam\u2019s most powerful incarnation yet. Earlier outbreaks were at least contained to our email inboxes, or hampered by the relatively primitive telemarketing technology of the past century. Now spam teleports into our purses and nightstands and innermost lives, advertising gastric balloons, demanding debt payments, speaking languages we don\u2019t understand. Spam dispatched by fly-by-night ministries even offers to pray for us.\nIf you plotted a graph of a phone call\u2019s usefulness from Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s first in 1876 until today, it would climb steadily through the 20th century, rocket skyward with the advent of mobile phones, and then take a U-turn and slap us around the ears with everything the machines have learned.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve returned right back to where we were in the \u201980s,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Hansen, an IT consultant who has testified as an expert witness in dozens of consumer lawsuits against robodialers. \u201cSame software. The only difference now is computers are exponentially faster. Tens of millions [of calls] versus thousands.\u201d\nHansen traces the phone spam era back to 1974, when two men in Colorado patented an \u201cautomatic telephone caller\u201d that simply dialed numbers in numerical sequence \u2014 555-1111, 555-1112 \u2014 and blared a prerecorded message at whomever picked up. The technology improved with cell centers\u2019 profit margins. By the early 1980s, Computerworld magazine was advertising $13,000 Davox terminals that fused a monitor, keyboard and a phone handset into a telemarketer\u2019s dream machine. Brrrrring brrrrring!\nIn 1991, a committee room full of U.S. senators listened to an answering machine recording that had been annoying people across the country. A disembodied voice boomed over Hawaiian background music: \u201cJust think about that, you and a friend or a loved one enjoying the beautiful beaches of Waikiki, and call me at 1-900-321-6666.\u201d\n\u201cTelannoyers,\u201d as some called them, were so endemic at the time that Congress passed laws restricting them, followed by the Do Not Call Registry in 2003. For a few years, it seemed like phone spam was contained. Then came the age of cellphones, international VoIP calls and offshore call centers that can mask their location to make it look like they are calling you from down the block. Then came the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory zeal, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai celebrated a 2018 court ruling undoing Obama-era restrictions on autodialers.\nIn April, a Senate subcommittee convened once again to discuss the phone-spam crisis. They interrogated a Florida telemarketer named Adrian Abramovich, who was accused of placing nearly 100 million robo-calls with spoofed caller IDs.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the kingpin of robo-calling that is alleged,\u201d Abramovich protested. \u201cI receive four or five robo-calls a day. . . . I\u2019ve been receiving more than ever, myself. Usually I never answer the phone.\u201d\nAbramovich had a point; the problem goes far beyond any one person or call center. Despite the government\u2019s $120 million dollar fine against him last May, the call-blocking company Hiya estimates spam calls increased nearly 50 percent in 2018. They come from all corners of the world \u2014 from the marketing departments of major American banks and from clandestine call centers hidden above bars in Delhi, India.\n\u201cI got one just the other night,\u201d said Margot Saunders, senior counsel for the National Consumer Law Center. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Hello Cathy.\u2019 I said, there\u2019s no Cathy here. A voice said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s okay. Since I got you . . . .\u2019 It took a few minutes to figure out I wasn\u2019t talking to a real person. It\u2019s a robot! There\u2019s a company making snippets of recorded voice which operators in India press buttons to implement.\u201d\nWhen Paul Romer got a 6 a.m. call from an unrecognized number at his home in New York last fall, he assumed it was spam and went back to sleep. He later learned it was from Sweden; he\u2019d won the Nobel Prize in economics.\nCourtney Kelsey, 21, made the same mistake when she answered her spam-infested iPhone in St. Louis this month, and the man on the other end struggled to pronounce her name.\n\u201cI asked him to \u2014 whatever list I\u2019m on or wherever they\u2019re calling from, could they take me off the list?\u201d Kelsey recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018I can\u2019t hear you. Is this Courtney?\u2019 I just hung up.\u201d\nShe ignored a second call, blocked the number and only later realized it was from the Ritz-Carlton, where she had applied for a serving job. Kelsey hadn\u2019t managed to reschedule the job interview by the time she spoke to The Washington Post last week.\nSo it\u2019s come to this. We confuse spambots for humans, and humans for spambots. The sci-fi author Charlie Stross once posited a future in which spam becomes so good at mimicking human interaction it becomes self-aware \u2014 the \u201cSpamularity.\u201d Is that what awaits us if the phones don\u2019t shut up?\nSaunders, the consumer group lawyer getting spammed by human simulacrums, says the nightmare could be over within months if the telecom giants would invest more in anti-spam technology, which is now spotty at best \u2014 or if the government would force them to (as the FCC\u2019s Pai has now indicated he might). If not, she said, the unsustainable status quo will continue.\nIn the meantime, Briscoe \u2014 the Texas newspaper publisher besieged with health insurance calls from not-Albemarle, N.C. \u2014 has tried just about every spam-blocking app on the market.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used RoboKiller. That hasn\u2019t worked with this one at all,\u201d he said. \u201cHiya. Truecaller. Mr. Number. Not even close.\u201d\nIn desperation, he once tried staying on the line with the spam, perhaps hoping to plead for his sanity with the promised \u201chealth insurance specialist.\u201d\nInstead, he said, an agent asked him for his height, weight, birth date and social security number. When Briscoe asked for an insurance license number, the agent supplied one as fake as whatever $299 anti-virus software is sold in an elevator.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want no [expletive] insurance anyway,\u201d the agent replied and, for a change, hung up on him.",

                "html": "<p>Overwhelmingly white school districts received $23 billion more than predominantly nonwhite school districts in state and local funding in 2016, despite serving roughly the same number of children, a new report finds.</p>\n<p>The funding gap is largely the result of the reliance on property taxes as a primary source of funding for schools. Communities in overwhelmingly white areas tend to be wealthier, and school districts&rsquo; ability to raise money depends on the value of local property and the ability of residents to pay higher taxes.</p>\n<p>And while state budgets gave heavily nonwhite districts slightly more money per student than they gave overwhelmingly white districts, in many states it was not enough to erase the local gaps.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;States have largely failed to keep up with the growing wealth disparities across their communities,&rdquo; concludes the <a href=\"https://edbuild.org/content/23-billion\">report released Tuesday </a>by EdBuild, a New Jersey-based research and advocacy group that focuses on school funding.</p>\n<p>The gap reflects a long-standing view that local schools should be both controlled and funded locally.</p>\n<p>The funding disparities that result have been challenged in many states, frequently in court. Many states have worked to make formulas more equitable, with varying success.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While we have made some progress on the issue of economic inequality in our schools, we still have a terribly inequitable system,&rdquo; the report said.</p>\n<p>EdBuild examined the nation&rsquo;s 13,000 traditional public school districts and found about 7,600 where more than 75 percent of students were white, and about 1,200 where more than 75 percent of students were not white. The nonwhite districts, which included many large cities, were much larger than the white districts, which included many small rural areas. But the two groups each had about the same number of students &mdash; 12.8 million children in nonwhite districts and 12.5 million in white districts.</p>\n<p>Nonwhite districts took in about $54 billion in 2016 in local tax dollars &mdash; or about $4,500 per student. White districts, home to higher incomes and less poverty, collected more than $77 billion, or just over $7,000 per student.</p>\n<p>On average, states added another $6,900 per student to white districts and almost $7,200 per student in nonwhite districts. But the overall gap in state and local funding was $23 billion. White districts, on average, had more than $2,000 more in funding per student than nonwhite districts.</p>\n<p>The analysis does not include federal dollars, much of which is targeted to the poorest communities.</p>\n<p>The problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild&rsquo;s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable.</p>\n<p>In Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts. Nonwhite districts in Maryland received $501 more per student than white districts, and in Virginia, they got $255 more per student.</p>\n<p>Overall, the report found 21 states where white districts got more funding and 14 states where nonwhite districts got more. The other states did not have enough racial diversity to meaningfully analyze, the report said.</p>\n<p>The gap was most dramatic in Arizona, where white districts were given $7,613 more per student than nonwhite districts. A dozen other states had gaps between $2,000 and $4,000 per student, with 10 of the states providing more funding to students in majority-white districts.</p>\n<p>Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, says states should do more to equalize funding. But he added that there is some benefit to local control.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When districts have to go to the community to get a bond passed, they have to make the case they are spending their money well and it&rsquo;s worth investing in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That has been an important form of accountability.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But overall, he said, the system needs to become more equitable. &ldquo;All of this is tough sledding in terms of the politics of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an area where the courts have played an important role.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Aaron Smith, an expert on school finance at the libertarian Reason Foundation, also supports more equity. He said conservatives should realize that if school funding were more even, it would bolster school choice programs, which many conservatives back. More equitable funding would make it clear how much money a school should get to educate each student, Smith said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every state has some sort of mechanism in place to try and equalize and neutralize the effects that local property wealth has,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The problem is that these equalization mechanisms vary substantially in terms of how effective they are.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Overwhelmingly white school districts received $23 billion more than predominantly nonwhite school districts in state and local funding in 2016, despite serving roughly the same number of children, a new report finds.\nThe funding gap is largely the result of the reliance on property taxes as a primary source of funding for schools. Communities in overwhelmingly white areas tend to be wealthier, and school districts\u2019 ability to raise money depends on the value of local property and the ability of residents to pay higher taxes.\nAnd while state budgets gave heavily nonwhite districts slightly more money per student than they gave overwhelmingly white districts, in many states it was not enough to erase the local gaps.\n\u201cStates have largely failed to keep up with the growing wealth disparities across their communities,\u201d concludes the report released Tuesday by EdBuild, a New Jersey-based research and advocacy group that focuses on school funding.\nThe gap reflects a long-standing view that local schools should be both controlled and funded locally.\nThe funding disparities that result have been challenged in many states, frequently in court. Many states have worked to make formulas more equitable, with varying success.\n\u201cWhile we have made some progress on the issue of economic inequality in our schools, we still have a terribly inequitable system,\u201d the report said.\nEdBuild examined the nation\u2019s 13,000 traditional public school districts and found about 7,600 where more than 75 percent of students were white, and about 1,200 where more than 75 percent of students were not white. The nonwhite districts, which included many large cities, were much larger than the white districts, which included many small rural areas. But the two groups each had about the same number of students \u2014 12.8 million children in nonwhite districts and 12.5 million in white districts.\nNonwhite districts took in about $54 billion in 2016 in local tax dollars \u2014 or about $4,500 per student. White districts, home to higher incomes and less poverty, collected more than $77 billion, or just over $7,000 per student.\nOn average, states added another $6,900 per student to white districts and almost $7,200 per student in nonwhite districts. But the overall gap in state and local funding was $23 billion. White districts, on average, had more than $2,000 more in funding per student than nonwhite districts.\nThe analysis does not include federal dollars, much of which is targeted to the poorest communities.\nThe problem is worse in states where districts are small, cordoning off wealthy communities and limiting the likelihood that wealthier taxpayers will subsidize poorer students, said Rebecca Sibilia, EdBuild\u2019s chief executive. In states such as Maryland and Virginia, she said, many school districts are comprised of entire counties, making funding more equitable.\nIn Maryland, 880,000 students are served by just 24 districts, vs. New Jersey, where 1.3 million students are divided between 540 districts. Nonwhite districts in Maryland received $501 more per student than white districts, and in Virginia, they got $255 more per student.\nOverall, the report found 21 states where white districts got more funding and 14 states where nonwhite districts got more. The other states did not have enough racial diversity to meaningfully analyze, the report said.\nThe gap was most dramatic in Arizona, where white districts were given $7,613 more per student than nonwhite districts. A dozen other states had gaps between $2,000 and $4,000 per student, with 10 of the states providing more funding to students in majority-white districts.\nMichael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative think tank, says states should do more to equalize funding. But he added that there is some benefit to local control.\n\u201cWhen districts have to go to the community to get a bond passed, they have to make the case they are spending their money well and it\u2019s worth investing in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been an important form of accountability.\u201d\nBut overall, he said, the system needs to become more equitable. \u201cAll of this is tough sledding in terms of the politics of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an area where the courts have played an important role.\u201d\nAaron Smith, an expert on school finance at the libertarian Reason Foundation, also supports more equity. He said conservatives should realize that if school funding were more even, it would bolster school choice programs, which many conservatives back. More equitable funding would make it clear how much money a school should get to educate each student, Smith said.\n\u201cEvery state has some sort of mechanism in place to try and equalize and neutralize the effects that local property wealth has,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that these equalization mechanisms vary substantially in terms of how effective they are.\u201d",

Neely has since issued an apology.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A week ago, I let my emotions overtake my better self,&rdquo; she said <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHMF38E8Hu8\">in a video posted to YouTube</a> on Saturday. &ldquo;And I apologize from the bottom of my heart. To my family, friends, neighbors and fellow Houstonians, I ask for forgiveness and understanding. I love Houston and ask that we come together to heal, and I extend my hand in friendship.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Houston Police Department&rsquo;s major assaults division is now investigating the altercation, according to spokesman Victor Senties.</p>\n<p>The incident occurred around 5:30 p.m. on Feb. 16, he said. The baby&rsquo;s father, Isaiah Allen, 31, made the complaint about an hour later. Allen told police that he and his wife were taking pictures of their baby when the woman approached, yelled at them and told them to get off the grass, Senties said. Allen said the woman struck him on his arms and hand, Senties said, before leaving the scene.</p>\n<p>The police department said it was not releasing the name of the woman because no charges had been filed in the case. Neely did not return a request for comment left with someone who picked up the phone at her home.</p>\n<p>The viral video does not capture what had sparked the argument. Allen&rsquo;s wife, Kelyn, said that the incident began when the woman drove by the esplanade and shouted at them through her window about &ldquo;trampling the grass that we pay for.&rdquo; She then got out of the car, and a dispute ensued about the woman&rsquo;s dog running near the young child. The photographer the couple was working with approached the woman, Kelyn said, to try to defuse the situation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At this point the lady stomps toward my baby and starts aggressively trying to remove the props placed around her, startling me. The baby, petrified by her aggression, started to scream and started crawling away from her into my arms,&rdquo; Kelyn wrote. &ldquo;This did not deter her and she continued &mdash; my husband and the photographer quickly approached her to block her from doing this and at this point I started to shout at the lady about her aggression upsetting my child.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These were our first professional shots we have taken of the baby since she&rsquo;s been born,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/socialite-who-harassed-family-during-baby-s-photo-shoot-issues-apology\">Kelyn told Click2Houston</a>. &ldquo;It was something that was supposed to be very special for us, and I hate the fact that, when I look at these pictures, this is what I have to remember.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kelyn declined to comment to The Washington Post beyond her Facebook post, saying that her lawyer had recommended against it.</p>\n<p>Neely also had issued an apology last week. She said that she had approached three commercial photography shoots in the area that day and had only gotten into an altercation with the Allens.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Broadacres Homeowners Association invests lots of money paying to maintain the trees, grass and walkways in our neighborhood. The high volume of commercial photography damages the property that Broadacres HOA pays to maintain and interferes with dog walkers and others who merely want to walk under the pretty trees,&rdquo; she said in a statement to ABC 13. &ldquo;I am very sorry that I got upset on late Saturday afternoon.&quot;</p>",

The baby\u2019s father, Isaiah Allen, 31, made the complaint about an hour later. Allen told police that he and his wife were taking pictures of their baby when the woman approached, yelled at them and told them to get off the grass, Senties said. Allen said the woman struck him on his arms and hand, Senties said, before leaving the scene.\nThe police department said it was not releasing the name of the woman because no charges had been filed in the case. Neely did not return a request for comment left with someone who picked up the phone at her home.\nThe viral video does not capture what had sparked the argument. Allen\u2019s wife, Kelyn, said that the incident began when the woman drove by the esplanade and shouted at them through her window about \u201ctrampling the grass that we pay for.\u201d She then got out of the car, and a dispute ensued about the woman\u2019s dog running near the young child. The photographer the couple was working with approached the woman, Kelyn said, to try to defuse the situation.\n\u201cAt this point the lady stomps toward my baby and starts aggressively trying to remove the props placed around her, startling me. The baby, petrified by her aggression, started to scream and started crawling away from her into my arms,\u201d Kelyn wrote. \u201cThis did not deter her and she continued \u2014 my husband and the photographer quickly approached her to block her from doing this and at this point I started to shout at the lady about her aggression upsetting my child.\u201d\n\u201cThese were our first professional shots we have taken of the baby since she\u2019s been born,\u201d Kelyn told Click2Houston. \u201cIt was something that was supposed to be very special for us, and I hate the fact that, when I look at these pictures, this is what I have to remember.\u201d\nKelyn declined to comment to The Washington Post beyond her Facebook post, saying that her lawyer had recommended against it.\nNeely also had issued an apology last week. She said that she had approached three commercial photography shoots in the area that day and had only gotten into an altercation with the Allens.\n\u201cThe Broadacres Homeowners Association invests lots of money paying to maintain the trees, grass and walkways in our neighborhood. The high volume of commercial photography damages the property that Broadacres HOA pays to maintain and interferes with dog walkers and others who merely want to walk under the pretty trees,\u201d she said in a statement to ABC 13. \u201cI am very sorry that I got upset on late Saturday afternoon.\"",

At noon in East Boston, after an hour of hurrahs from several hundred investors, a swollen crowd jammed itself into three trains for the 13 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-mile ride to Salem, Mass. &mdash; where a festive dinner for 600 awaited at the railroad&rsquo;s new depot. Separated by half a mile, the locomotives clattered along at a leisurely pace, allowing the passengers plenty of time to admire the many engineering marvels &mdash; overpasses, embankments, stone walls &mdash; that work crews had fashioned in the excavated cavities of rock and earth. Newspaper correspondents representing nearly every town along the route were on hand to chronicle the history-making moment.</p>\n<p>The tail end of the opening-day procession trundled into Salem just ahead of an evening downpour. The disembarking passengers then joined a who&rsquo;s who of the state&rsquo;s business and political elites. Leading figures from the Whig and Democratic parties mingled with the presidents of the state&rsquo;s other railway companies, who had come to salute the latest member of their growing club.</p>\n<p>To match the grand occasion, the Eastern&rsquo;s ruddy-cheeked president, George Peabody, had prepared a speech brimming with ambition. The railroad would not be merely a means of transportation, Peabody boldly predicted. It would be a force for social change. Steam locomotion would bind together the sprawling United States and help &ldquo;subdue local prejudices.&rdquo; A rail-connected nation, east to west, north to south, would send &ldquo;a whole people moving onward together in a career of unexampled prosperity, bearing in their front the standard of Equal Rights.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Peabody would have said all that, but as the Boston Courier reported, &ldquo;from the extreme size of the building, the noise produced by the popping of Champagne corks, etc., he could only make himself heard by a few persons.&rdquo; Chagrined, he turned to Boston Daily Advertiser publisher Nathan Hale and requested that Hale arrange to print the speech in full, so that the people of Massachusetts might read and digest it at their leisure. Hale nodded his assent.</p>\n<p>The next day, though, when Peabody&rsquo;s railroad officially threw open its doors to the paying public, the &ldquo;standard of Equal Rights&rdquo; was nowhere in sight. Instead, the Eastern&rsquo;s white and black passengers found separate cars awaiting them.</p>\n<figure><img data-hi-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_1_new.jpg&w=988\" data-low-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_1_new.jpg&w=800\" data-raw-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_1_new.jpg\" src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_1_new.jpg&w=60\"></img></figure>\n<p>Six weeks later, on October 12, 1838, an item appeared in the Salem Gazette, telling the story of two drunken white sailors, Benjamin King and John Smith, charged with damaging the Eastern Rail Road&rsquo;s track in retaliation for their ejection from the 6 o&rsquo;clock evening run to Salem. Soon after departure, before the conductor ordered their removal, the crew had halted the locomotive &ldquo;and compelled Smith, who was the drunkest, to take his seat in the &lsquo;refuse&rsquo; or &lsquo;Jim Crow&rsquo; car, at the end of the train.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In researching the story of separation &mdash; which was the 19th-century term, universally used in print and conversation &mdash; this was the earliest record I could find of the use of &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; as a shorthand for discrimination in public accommodations. When it showed up in my digital digging, I was surprised. This was 1838, in the North, at the dawn of the railroad age. Not 1888, when Mississippi passed the first law in the South explicitly mandating &ldquo;equal but separate accommodation for white and colored passengers&rdquo; on trains operating within its borders, going beyond a Florida law enacted a year earlier. Not 1896, when the Supreme Court sanctioned Louisiana&rsquo;s &ldquo;equal but separate&rdquo; railroad act in its infamous <i>Plessy v. Ferguson </i>ruling.</p>\n<p>This mention of &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; was not something I had come across in the notable works I had read on Northern racial prejudice during my early explorations. (Much later, in rechecking my research, I would come across a footnote in a new book citing the Gazette article.) I was fascinated by this 600-word report from the Salem police court. The newspaper had used &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; without explanation, as if the contemptuous label was already embedded in the train crew&rsquo;s lexicon, as if its readers already understood. How could that be?</p>\n<p>The 1838 newspaper had used &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; without explanation, as if the contemptuous label was already embedded in the train crew&rsquo;s lexicon, as if its readers already understood. How could that be?</p>\n<p>By 1838, the phrase was well in circulation &mdash; thanks in part to the astounding popularity of Thomas Dartmouth Rice, a white entertainer who called himself the &ldquo;Original Jim Crow.&rdquo; Rice could not claim to be the first white man to sing in blackface when he bounded onto the stages of New England and elsewhere in the early 1830s. But he could soon claim to be the best known. He performed in a short-waisted blue coat, threadbare gold pants and mismatched shoes, singing, &ldquo;Eb&rsquo;ry time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.&rdquo; Newspaper editors and letter writers picked up the phrase, routinely accusing politicians of &ldquo;jumping Jim Crow&rdquo; for giving up a principle too easily or abandoning their party&rsquo;s cause.</p>\n<p>Rice&rsquo;s racist caricature took on a life all its own. Figurines, touted as the &ldquo;complete, original Jim Crow,&rdquo; showed up on tables at annual spring fairs in Massachusetts. Boston merchants carried music boxes that played &ldquo;Jim Crow, Zip Coon and other tunes.&rdquo; A tour of England widened his reputation.</p>\n<p>It was, apparently, just a short hop from there to christening the car for black passengers &mdash; and anyone else the railroad considered undesirable &mdash; as the &ldquo;Jim Crow.&rdquo; At first, there wasn&rsquo;t much of an outcry, perhaps because people of color made up barely 1 percent of the Massachusetts population in 1840. But before long, the abolitionist movement had seized on the Eastern&rsquo;s policy of separation, making it the centerpiece of a rancorous political struggle, one with enduring implications &mdash; about the deep roots of Northern racism, about the power of corporations, about the American legal system&rsquo;s often intolerant response to the long line of resisters engaged in an unceasing fight for civil rights and racial justice.</p>\n<p>In June 1841, not quite three years after the birth of the Jim Crow car, David Ruggles arrived in Massachusetts for a series of abolitionist strategy sessions. He did not come to pick a fight over transportation.</p>\n<p>Only 31 years old but with failing eyesight &mdash; cataracts would leave him blind by the following year &mdash; Ruggles had been born free in Connecticut. As secretary of the New York Committee of Vigilance, he had helped hundreds of runaways from slavery. Frederick Douglass, who had stayed with Ruggles for a few weeks after fleeing slavery in Maryland, was inspired by this slightly built man of color and his ingenuity at devising escape routes for the many fugitives who flowed through his house. &ldquo;Though watched and hemmed in on almost every side, he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies,&rdquo; Douglass later marveled in his memoirs.</p>\n<p>Now, on a pleasantly sunny Saturday morning, Ruggles boarded the steamboat Telegraph in New Bedford&rsquo;s harbor, bound for Nantucket and a meeting of abolitionists there. Ruggles learned that there were two fares. For $2, passengers could roam the ship, free to go anywhere. For 50 cents less, they could confine themselves to the cheap seats on the forward deck. Ruggles opted for the higher fare. The captain refused to accept it. Words became shouts, and in the ensuing scuffle, Ruggles lost his hat and the papers he had brought with him. He never made it to the meeting in Nantucket.</p>\n<p>Several weeks later, on the New Bedford &amp; Taunton railway&rsquo;s service to Boston, Ruggles entered the whites-only car, $2 ticket in hand. Among the eight passenger railways operating in the state, only three had chosen the custom of separate cars &mdash; and the New Bedford &amp; Taunton was one of them. The conductor summoned reinforcements to eject Ruggles. He put up a fight, and had the bruises and torn clothes to show for it. His baggage went on to Boston. He went to New Bedford to file a formal claim of assault against the railroad company and the men who had manhandled him.</p>\n<p>At a two-day trial before New Bedford police judge Henry H. Crapo, the railroad president testified that the company&rsquo;s rule benefited everyone because it &ldquo;separated the drunken, dirty, ragged and colored people from the others.&rdquo; Ruggles told the judge that he saw no benefit in paying $2 to sit with the drunken, dirty and ragged. He had paid full price &mdash; the same price as white passengers &mdash; and that should give him the same privileges. But none of his arguments moved Crapo. The railroad was entitled, the judge said, to make and enforce whatever rules it deemed necessary. &ldquo;The cars are the property of the stockholders, and as such are private property,&rdquo; Crapo declared.</p>\n<p>Crapo&rsquo;s ruling brought a vehement denunciation from William Lloyd Garrison, editor of the abolitionist newspaper the Liberator. Garrison took to its pages to censure Crapo for &ldquo;giving his legal sanction to the dastardly assault and battery.&rdquo; In an accompanying article, Ruggles pronounced the trial &ldquo;the greatest farce I ever witnessed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Less than two weeks later, with his railroad battle still a fresh wound, Ruggles was the guest of honor at a gala dinner celebrating his contributions to the abolitionist cause. &ldquo;Action is everything,&rdquo; he exhorted his admirers, a mixed gathering of whites and blacks. &ldquo;With it, we are successful. Without it, all our enthusiasm is worse than nothing.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img data-hi-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_2_new.jpg&w=988\" data-low-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_2_new.jpg&w=800\" data-raw-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_2_new.jpg\" src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_2_new.jpg&w=60\"></img></figure>\n<p>Action came in many forms. Two weeks after the gala dinner, the conductor and crew on the Eastern Rail Road found themselves face-to-face with resistance in the imposing form of Frederick Douglass and a white abolitionist named John Collins, the general agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.</p>\n<p>The Eastern had extended its Salem line to Portsmouth, N.H., 16 miles north of the Massachusetts border. Grateful passengers included Collins, whose travel time to abolitionist chapters in southern New Hampshire had shrunk dramatically. On Sept. 8, 1841, Collins was heading there for an annual meeting, accompanied by Douglass, the Anti-Slavery Society&rsquo;s newest employee and rising star. Less than a month before, Douglass had transfixed the abolitionists&rsquo; midsummer gathering with a spontaneous, eloquent description of his days in slavery. Almost instantly, he went from obscurity to symbol, a flesh-and-blood example of the wonders that abolition could bring.</p>\n<p>The traveling duo were an unusual pair &mdash; the excitable, unimposing Collins, seven or eight years older, born in Vermont, known for his sarcastic pen and long face; the stern-eyed, broad-shouldered Douglass, not quite 24, new to anti-slavery politics. But the Eastern conductor had his eye on the only contrast that mattered: Collins was white, Douglass was not.</p>\n<p>When the conductor ordered them to separate, Douglass stayed put. The conductor laid down the usual ultimatum: the Jim Crow car or ejection. Collins demanded to know the basis for the conductor&rsquo;s directive. The conductor ripped down a posted placard from the car&rsquo;s entrance and thrust it toward them. Collins treated the placard&rsquo;s words as one more debating point, arguing that the rule violated the state constitution&rsquo;s guarantee of equal rights. But he and Douglass proved no match for the half-dozen men who seized Douglass and dragged him out of the car.</p>\n<p>Then, a complicating sequence of events for the exasperated conductor: Another abolitionist on the train, George Foster, announced his intention to join Douglass in his exile from the whites-only car. The conductor stood firm against this unexpected challenge, telling Foster that he &ldquo;was not black enough to sit there.&rdquo; Foster fumed, but retreated.</p>\n<p>The next day at the meeting in New Hampshire, Collins and Douglass ignited the assembled with their account. Soon, the abolitionists had more than another outrage to discuss. Thanks to Ruggles and Douglass, they now had a rallying cry and a new cause: Ban the &ldquo;dirt car,&rdquo; as it was also known. Send Jim Crow, they demanded, to the &ldquo;receptacle of forgotten barbarisms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Traveling white and black abolitionists now demanded to sit together, in one car or the other. The tactic of &ldquo;bearing witness&rdquo; introduced a new level of danger into every encounter.</p>\n<p>The fall of 1841 brought more clashes on the Eastern and New Bedford railways. Traveling white and black abolitionists now demanded to sit together, in one car or the other. The tactic of &ldquo;bearing witness,&rdquo; either by protesting an eviction or by trying to join the ejected traveler in the other car, introduced a new level of danger into every encounter.</p>\n<p>On Sept. 28, Collins met Douglass and two white abolitionists &mdash; a female friend of Collins&rsquo;s, and James N. Buffum, secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society&rsquo;s chapter in Lynn &mdash; at the Lynn station for a trip to Newburyport, near the Massachusetts-New Hampshire line. The foursome planted themselves in the whites-only car, known as &ldquo;the long car.&rdquo; Douglass regarded the Eastern long cars as &ldquo;one of the best railroad carriages&rdquo; then in operation, with &ldquo;luxuriant and beautiful&rdquo; seats. The enraged conductor ordered Douglass out. When Buffum described his intention to go with Douglass, the conductor set down his marker: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d as soon haul you out of his car, as I&rsquo;d haul him from this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Douglass refused to budge. Six men were needed to oust him. &ldquo;They clutched me, head, neck, and shoulders,&rdquo; Douglass wrote later. &ldquo;But, in anticipation of the stretching to which I was about to be subjected, I had interwoven myself among the seats. In dragging me out, on this occasion, it must have cost the company twenty-five or thirty dollars, for I tore up seats and all.&rdquo; At the next stop, his white companions were forced to leave the train as well.</p>\n<p>Buffum complained to the Eastern superintendent, Stephen Chase, whose name appeared on the train&rsquo;s placard of rules. Buffum and Chase belonged to the same Quaker meeting house, and their relationship was already strained. In the pages of the Liberator, Chase had been attacked as a hypocrite, a Quaker who believed in the inhumane treatment of his passengers.</p>\n<p>Buffum confronted Chase with a Quaker-flavored accusation, as recounted in a 1922 history of the Eastern Rail Road: &ldquo;Stephen, I don&rsquo;t think thee does right to utilize a Jim Crow car on thy train.&rdquo; Chase fired back with his own charge of hypocrisy: &ldquo;Well, James, I&rsquo;ll tell thee, when thee abolishes the colored pews in the meeting house, then I&rsquo;ll abolish the Jim Crow car.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By the following week, the uproar had bloomed into a full-flowered controversy. A hastily organized town meeting in Lynn ended with resolutions denouncing the railroad and Chase, as well as a call for a boycott unless the railroad changed its policy. Chase, claiming he was trying to avoid trouble, came up with a bold idea: He ordered the trains not to stop at the Lynn station, where Douglass frequently climbed aboard.</p>\n<p>The plan backfired. Irate Lynn passengers, their travel arrangements disrupted, turned on the railroad. The editor of the Lynn Record dismissed Chase&rsquo;s fear of &ldquo;mob violence&rdquo; as a pretense designed to &ldquo;enlist the sympathies of the people, and to turn their indignation from themselves.&rdquo; Chase quickly rescinded his order.</p>\n<p>The abolitionists celebrated the turn of events. &ldquo;I am convinced that the agitation growing out of these incidents will do much good,&rdquo; Buffum wrote to the Liberator, now filled every week with a running chronicle of fresh indignities on the Eastern and New Bedford lines. &ldquo;Indeed, everywhere I go, I hear men and women talking of these shameful transgressions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After three years of relative obscurity, the issue of separate railroad cars had vaulted to the top of the abolitionist agenda, reaching parity with the other issues then consuming the movement: petitioning Congress to outlaw slavery in the District of Columbia; protesting the return of fugitives to their Southern masters; ending Massachusetts&rsquo;s ban on intermarriage.</p>\n<p>Dozens of petitions went to the legislature, calling for a law that would forbid separate cars. The most prominent one, signed by Garrison, Collins and Douglass, minced no words. Legislation was needed so that railroads &ldquo;may no longer claim the right&rdquo; of assigning seats &ldquo;on the sole ground of a difference in color,&rdquo; and to stop railroad employees from &ldquo;insulting, assaulting and ejecting white passengers&rdquo; who objected.</p>\n<p>That drew several counter-petitions from groups of white passengers, including one arguing that their &ldquo;comfort and convenience&rdquo; would be seriously diminished if they had to share &ldquo;the company of blacks.&rdquo; On an early November evening in 1841, Douglass challenged a rapt audience from the Anti-Slavery Society&rsquo;s Plymouth chapter to see the insidiousness of Northern-style prejudice: &ldquo;People in general will say they like colored men as well as any other, <i>but in their proper place</i>. Who is to decide what is their proper place?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The outcome of the looming legislative battle was not at all certain. Most legislators stood against slavery, but opposing the South&rsquo;s &ldquo;peculiar institution&rdquo; did not translate to a belief that freedom meant the right to mix freely with whites in the North. There were plenty of legislators who viewed anyone of color as inferior, who felt no law could undo what God and nature had created.</p>\n<figure><img data-hi-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_3_new.jpg&w=988\" data-low-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_3_new.jpg&w=800\" data-raw-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_3_new.jpg\" src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_3_new.jpg&w=60\"></img></figure>\n<p>The scene that unfolded in the Massachusetts House of Representatives on Feb. 10, 1842, came with no precedent. A special joint committee, chaired by an abolitionist senator from Plymouth, had granted a full hearing to the petitioners seeking a ban on separate cars. Word had gotten out: A man of color would be testifying.</p>\n<p>Curious spectators, including legislators, crowded into the cavernous hall. Few in the crowd needed an introduction to the first witness. Wendell Phillips was the son of a former Boston mayor and at 30 years old already among the most prominent of New England abolitionists. Like Garrison and Collins, he had shown his support for black passengers by attempting to ride with them in the separate car. His protest had led the National Anti-Slavery Standard to exclaim that separation on railroads would end if only 10 other &ldquo;patricians&rdquo; would join Phillips in the Jim Crow coaches.</p>\n<p>His rousing oratories had mesmerized even the most lukewarm slavery opponents. He drew on those skills in delivering an impassioned 90-minute plea against separation. &ldquo;There are those who consider this a trifling matter,&rdquo; Phillips told the white men arrayed before him. &ldquo;To the colored citizen, sir, it is not so.&rdquo; A white passenger could not begin to understand &ldquo;the inconvenience, the wrong, the disgrace, the insult and suffering of these unconstitutional bylaws of corporations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Phillips took direct aim at Judge Crapo&rsquo;s ruling against Ruggles: Yes, the railroads might be privately owned, as Crapo had noted, but they were public in every way that mattered. They operated with a public charter. They laid their tracks with public loans from the state treasury, on public rights of way. They are, Phillips told the committee, &ldquo;creatures of your own enactment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As Phillips sat down, to murmurs of approval, the crowd craned for a good look at the next witness: Charles Lenox Remond, who had come to offer a firsthand account of one black citizen&rsquo;s travels on the Eastern Rail Road. A year older than Phillips, Remond was no stranger to the abolitionists in the hall. He had just returned from a 19-month lecture tour of Britain and Ireland that had brought him acclaim and a place of honor at the Anti-Slavery Society&rsquo;s annual meeting two weeks earlier.</p>\n<p>But to most in the crowd, Remond was an unknown. A spectator muttered contemptuously to a correspondent for a New York abolitionist newspaper, &ldquo;He will have to ask his master what to say.&rdquo; After Remond had finished, the correspondent asked the spectator what he thought now. &ldquo;Why, I think,&rdquo; said the spectator, &ldquo;the colored man is the ablest man of the two.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Remond&rsquo;s travels abroad gave him an unusual perspective, and he shrewdly made the most of it. On trains and steamboats in Europe, in hotels and on the street, he said, &ldquo;in no instance was I insulted, or treated in any way distinct or dissimilar from other passengers or travelers.&rdquo; Yet on his return to Boston, just before Christmas 1841, he was immediately reminded of his inferior status in the land of his birth. Buying a one-price-fits-all ticket to Salem, where his parents lived, he was ushered to a dismal, dirty car. Europe suddenly seemed very far away. &ldquo;I took my seat peaceably,&rdquo; he told the committee, &ldquo;unwilling to descend so low as to bandy words with the superintendents or contest my rights with conductors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A few days later, Remond continued, he ran into Eastern superintendent Stephen Chase. The two men knew each other from growing up in Salem. Chase asked Remond if he was glad to be home after such a lengthy absence and was taken aback by Remond&rsquo;s tart answer: &ldquo;I never felt to loathe my American name so much as since my arrival.&rdquo; Remond asked Chase how separation would make him feel &mdash; if, for example, passengers with red hair, like Chase, had to ride separately. Chase &ldquo;could make no reply.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Remond then drove his point home to the committee. He had no control over his skin color, just as Chase had none over the color of his hair. &ldquo;Complexion,&rdquo; Remond said, &ldquo;can in no sense be construed into crime, much less be rightfully made the criterion of rights.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The newspaper reports reflected the usual split in public opinion. One Boston correspondent called Remond&rsquo;s delivery &ldquo;graceful and pointed&rdquo; and surmised that &ldquo;equal justice&rdquo; would prevail. The Liberator, with its usual enthusiasm, published verbatim accounts of the testimony. The correspondent for the Hampshire Gazette, meanwhile, complained sourly about these &ldquo;petty&rdquo; petitions of &ldquo;trifling importance&rdquo; taking up the legislature&rsquo;s time. Several newspapers carried nothing at all.</p>\n<p>Another famous son of Boston, Charles Francis Adams, watched the Phillips and Remond testimony with keen interest. In only his second year as a member of the Massachusetts House, Adams had decidedly mixed feelings about what to do about separate railroad cars. He deplored the practice but had grave misgivings about the precedent that would be set if the legislature intervened in the affairs of corporations. After listening to Phillips and Remond, Adams wrote in his diary, &ldquo;I was disappointed at the general character of the argument and my mind was in greater doubt than ever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Doubt was a place where Adams often dwelled. Other members of Boston&rsquo;s elite families had donned the abolitionist label in recent years and were wearing it with pride. Not Adams. He was staunchly anti-slavery and would later lead a wing of the Whig Party into a national anti-slavery role. But he rejected immediate abolition as a solution.</p>\n<p>Until he had bowed to the Whig Party&rsquo;s entreaties to join its ticket, Adams had spent a good portion of his first 33 years looking for an escape from his presumed destiny. The Adams clan was as close to aristocracy as any in the young republic, and Charles felt every ounce of that weight. He revered his grandfather, John Adams, the nation&rsquo;s second president, and loved and respected his father, the nation&rsquo;s sixth. Charles wrote often in his diary of his ambition to leave his own mark in the world. But he claimed to detest the profession that had made his family so influential &mdash; not just the practice of it, but everything about it.</p>\n<p>Adams valued independence more than any cause. He was generally an abolitionist ally, but hardly a reliable one. After hearing out yet another abolitionist appeal for help, he scribbled in his diary, &ldquo;I am willing to advance their principles as far as I can approve them but I will not consent to make myself their slave.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Three weeks after the Phillips-Remond testimony, the special legislative committee on separate railroad cars issued its much-anticipated report. It could not have been more favorable if the abolitionists had drafted it themselves.</p>\n<p>It did not matter, the report said, that some passengers preferred separation. The Massachusetts Constitution had decreed equal rights &mdash; at least for its male citizens &mdash; and that meant no discrimination by color, descent or religious sect. The committee recommended a bill making railroads liable for criminal penalties if they discriminated. The proposal brought a howl of protest from one state senator, who warned that &ldquo;this foolish mixing&rdquo; would spread to theaters, hotels and other public places.</p>\n<p>A final vote on repealing the intermarriage ban came up first. It passed the state Senate by a comfortable margin but failed in the House by four votes. Adams, who had spoken out in favor of the repeal, wasn&rsquo;t surprised. He had felt the House&rsquo;s mood shifting after the Boston Advertiser had come out for keeping the ban. &ldquo;So hard it is in a community to do away with a deep rooted prejudice,&rdquo; he wrote in his diary.</p>\n<p>The Senate, meanwhile, saved Adams from having to decide on the separate car bill. Opponents, sensing they now had the votes to put the issue on hold, moved for an indefinite postponement. They won, 18 to 13.</p>\n<p>Garrison wrote bitterly of the dual defeat: &ldquo;Humanity and Liberty have yet a mighty work to accomplish in Massachusetts.&rdquo; A month later, he debuted a new tactic in the Liberator: a &ldquo;traveller&rsquo;s directory.&rdquo; Modeled after the train timetables, the directory informed passengers of how they could expect to be treated on each of the state&rsquo;s railways.</p>\n<p>On the Boston and Lowell: <i>&ldquo;humanity respected.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>On the Western: <i>&ldquo;equality of privileges.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>On the Eastern: <i>&ldquo;an odious distinction on account of color, and a bullying propensity to carry it out.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<figure><img data-hi-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_4_new.jpg&w=988\" data-low-res-src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_4_new.jpg&w=800\" data-raw-src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_4_new.jpg\" src=\"https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2019/02/lux_4_new.jpg&w=60\"></img></figure>\n<p>Another year of confrontations did not eliminate Adams&rsquo;s doubts about the railroad bill. As the 1843 session got underway, his attention was elsewhere, primarily on the George Latimer fugitive case. A Virginia slaveholder, claiming ownership of Latimer, had asked Massachusetts to hold Latimer and return him, no questions asked. This was a matter that went directly to the heart of the country&rsquo;s great national divide: Could a Northern state be forced, against the principles of its own constitution, to comply with a slave owner&rsquo;s request? Adams, who was heading the legislative committee investigating the Latimer case, had no misgivings on this issue. He favored enactment of a &ldquo;personal liberty&rdquo; law that would prohibit the use of any Massachusetts property or official in a Southerner&rsquo;s hunt for a runaway slave.</p>\n<p>The Latimer case stirred public opinion like none other. At the end of January 1843, two men, using a stretcher resting on their shoulders, carried petitions into the State House bearing an astounding 64,000 signatures, more than 10 percent of the state&rsquo;s adult population. The abolitionists who orchestrated the event asked Adams to make the formal presentation to the House. &ldquo;This is perhaps the most memorable event of my life,&rdquo; Adams wrote that night. &ldquo;I feel some degree of pride in the fact that I was selected for such a purpose.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He felt nothing of the sort about the railroad bill, and wished the legislation would disappear. But like a conductor enforcing the separate car rules, he found confrontation hard to avoid. The climactic moment came on Feb. 6, 1843, a cloudy Monday, one week after his Latimer triumph. The House took up the railroad bill for a final debate. After a divisive discussion that pitted Whig against Whig, Democrat against Democrat, Adams reluctantly rose to his feet. He had made up his mind to vote against the bill. But he was eager to avoid saying so publicly, given the &ldquo;strong undercurrent of prejudice&rdquo; in the opposition&rsquo;s speeches. Desperate to find an alternate path, he fell back on a direct appeal to the railroads themselves.</p>\n<p>There was no question in his mind, Adams told his House colleagues, that the legislature &ldquo;had the right&rdquo; to pass a bill. But &ldquo;it would be a kind of entering wedge to a general interference with the charters of all corporations,&rdquo; and he did not think that approach was wise. With a dramatic air, he turned to the legislative reporters and instructed them to write down his words precisely. Perhaps the offending railroads, he said, &ldquo;would take the advice of a humble member of the House&rdquo; and voluntarily rescind their bylaws allowing separate cars. That would &ldquo;save the necessity of a resort to legislation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Swiftly, the House seized on Adams&rsquo;s artful dodge, postponing any action by an overwhelming margin, 171 to 61. The railroads, saved from state interference, took Adams&rsquo;s hint: By the end of 1843, the Jim Crow cars were gone from the state&rsquo;s railways.</p>\n<p>Without question, the abolitionists had won a victory. Still, it was a small blow against the entrenched view among many Northern whites that separation was best for all concerned. Over the next few decades, action came often, in new forms, from new resisters. Their legal challenges met with hostility and ended mostly in rejection, but they kept coming, even in the face of violence.</p>\n<p>In 1849, the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit protesting separate schools, prompting a campaign that ended six years later with a landmark state law prohibiting the use of &ldquo;race, color or religious opinions&rdquo; in admitting students to public schools. In 1858, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld a steamboat company&rsquo;s refusal to sell a cabin berth to black abolitionist William Howard Day. In 1867, as the states were ratifying a new constitutional amendment with an equal protection clause, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed a bitter defeat to teacher Mary Miles, who was ejected from a West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad train for refusing to leave the whites-only car. All cases from the North, all later cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in its infamous 1896 <i>Plessy v. Ferguson </i>ruling, written by a New England-born justice for a 7-1 majority dominated by Northerners.</p>\n<p>George Peabody&rsquo;s rosy prediction had no chance of coming true. It takes more than a national network of railroad lines to &ldquo;subdue local prejudices.&rdquo; It takes &mdash; today as in 1838 &mdash; laws, people, action, resistance, perseverance. In the case of the U.S. courts, it requires a willingness to revisit rulings, overturn mistakes and look with fresh eyes at the fear, anger and prejudice that persists from the nation&rsquo;s legacy of racial separation and prolonged injustice.</p>\n<p><em>Steve Luxenberg is a Washington Post associate editor.

                "text": "On a late summer\u2019s day in 1838, the Eastern Rail Road threw a celebration to announce itself to the world. At noon in East Boston, after an hour of hurrahs from several hundred investors, a swollen crowd jammed itself into three trains for the 13 1/2-mile ride to Salem, Mass. \u2014 where a festive dinner for 600 awaited at the railroad\u2019s new depot. Separated by half a mile, the locomotives clattered along at a leisurely pace, allowing the passengers plenty of time to admire the many engineering marvels \u2014 overpasses, embankments, stone walls \u2014 that work crews had fashioned in the excavated cavities of rock and earth. Newspaper correspondents representing nearly every town along the route were on hand to chronicle the history-making moment.\nThe tail end of the opening-day procession trundled into Salem just ahead of an evening downpour. The disembarking passengers then joined a who\u2019s who of the state\u2019s business and political elites. Leading figures from the Whig and Democratic parties mingled with the presidents of the state\u2019s other railway companies, who had come to salute the latest member of their growing club.\nTo match the grand occasion, the Eastern\u2019s ruddy-cheeked president, George Peabody, had prepared a speech brimming with ambition. The railroad would not be merely a means of transportation, Peabody boldly predicted. It would be a force for social change. Steam locomotion would bind together the sprawling United States and help \u201csubdue local prejudices.\u201d A rail-connected nation, east to west, north to south, would send \u201ca whole people moving onward together in a career of unexampled prosperity, bearing in their front the standard of Equal Rights.\u201d\nPeabody would have said all that, but as the Boston Courier reported, \u201cfrom the extreme size of the building, the noise produced by the popping of Champagne corks, etc., he could only make himself heard by a few persons.\u201d Chagrined, he turned to Boston Daily Advertiser publisher Nathan Hale and requested that Hale arrange to print the speech in full, so that the people of Massachusetts might read and digest it at their leisure. Hale nodded his assent.\nThe next day, though, when Peabody\u2019s railroad officially threw open its doors to the paying public, the \u201cstandard of Equal Rights\u201d was nowhere in sight. Instead, the Eastern\u2019s white and black passengers found separate cars awaiting them.\nSix weeks later, on October 12, 1838, an item appeared in the Salem Gazette, telling the story of two drunken white sailors, Benjamin King and John Smith, charged with damaging the Eastern Rail Road\u2019s track in retaliation for their ejection from the 6 o\u2019clock evening run to Salem. Soon after departure, before the conductor ordered their removal, the crew had halted the locomotive \u201cand compelled Smith, who was the drunkest, to take his seat in the \u2018refuse\u2019 or \u2018Jim Crow\u2019 car, at the end of the train.\u201d\nIn researching the story of separation \u2014 which was the 19th-century term, universally used in print and conversation \u2014 this was the earliest record I could find of the use of \u201cJim Crow\u201d as a shorthand for discrimination in public accommodations. When it showed up in my digital digging, I was surprised. This was 1838, in the North, at the dawn of the railroad age. Not 1888, when Mississippi passed the first law in the South explicitly mandating \u201cequal but separate accommodation for white and colored passengers\u201d on trains operating within its borders, going beyond a Florida law enacted a year earlier. Not 1896, when the Supreme Court sanctioned Louisiana\u2019s \u201cequal but separate\u201d railroad act in its infamous Plessy v. Ferguson ruling.\nThis mention of \u201cJim Crow\u201d was not something I had come across in the notable works I had read on Northern racial prejudice during my early explorations. (Much later, in rechecking my research, I would come across a footnote in a new book citing the Gazette article.) I was fascinated by this 600-word report from the Salem police court. The newspaper had used \u201cJim Crow\u201d without explanation, as if the contemptuous label was already embedded in the train crew\u2019s lexicon, as if its readers already understood. How could that be?\nThe 1838 newspaper had used \u201cJim Crow\u201d without explanation, as if the contemptuous label was already embedded in the train crew\u2019s lexicon, as if its readers already understood. How could that be?\nBy 1838, the phrase was well in circulation \u2014 thanks in part to the astounding popularity of Thomas Dartmouth Rice, a white entertainer who called himself the \u201cOriginal Jim Crow.\u201d Rice could not claim to be the first white man to sing in blackface when he bounded onto the stages of New England and elsewhere in the early 1830s. But he could soon claim to be the best known. He performed in a short-waisted blue coat, threadbare gold pants and mismatched shoes, singing, \u201cEb\u2019ry time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.\u201d Newspaper editors and letter writers picked up the phrase, routinely accusing politicians of \u201cjumping Jim Crow\u201d for giving up a principle too easily or abandoning their party\u2019s cause.\nRice\u2019s racist caricature took on a life all its own. Figurines, touted as the \u201ccomplete, original Jim Crow,\u201d showed up on tables at annual spring fairs in Massachusetts. Boston merchants carried music boxes that played \u201cJim Crow, Zip Coon and other tunes.\u201d A tour of England widened his reputation.\nIt was, apparently, just a short hop from there to christening the car for black passengers \u2014 and anyone else the railroad considered undesirable \u2014 as the \u201cJim Crow.\u201d At first, there wasn\u2019t much of an outcry, perhaps because people of color made up barely 1 percent of the Massachusetts population in 1840. But before long, the abolitionist movement had seized on the Eastern\u2019s policy of separation, making it the centerpiece of a rancorous political struggle, one with enduring implications \u2014 about the deep roots of Northern racism, about the power of corporations, about the American legal system\u2019s often intolerant response to the long line of resisters engaged in an unceasing fight for civil rights and racial justice.\nIn June 1841, not quite three years after the birth of the Jim Crow car, David Ruggles arrived in Massachusetts for a series of abolitionist strategy sessions. He did not come to pick a fight over transportation.\nOnly 31 years old but with failing eyesight \u2014 cataracts would leave him blind by the following year \u2014 Ruggles had been born free in Connecticut. As secretary of the New York Committee of Vigilance, he had helped hundreds of runaways from slavery. Frederick Douglass, who had stayed with Ruggles for a few weeks after fleeing slavery in Maryland, was inspired by this slightly built man of color and his ingenuity at devising escape routes for the many fugitives who flowed through his house. \u201cThough watched and hemmed in on almost every side, he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies,\u201d Douglass later marveled in his memoirs.\nNow, on a pleasantly sunny Saturday morning, Ruggles boarded the steamboat Telegraph in New Bedford\u2019s harbor, bound for Nantucket and a meeting of abolitionists there. Ruggles learned that there were two fares. For $2, passengers could roam the ship, free to go anywhere. For 50 cents less, they could confine themselves to the cheap seats on the forward deck. Ruggles opted for the higher fare. The captain refused to accept it. Words became shouts, and in the ensuing scuffle, Ruggles lost his hat and the papers he had brought with him. He never made it to the meeting in Nantucket.\nSeveral weeks later, on the New Bedford & Taunton railway\u2019s service to Boston, Ruggles entered the whites-only car, $2 ticket in hand. Among the eight passenger railways operating in the state, only three had chosen the custom of separate cars \u2014 and the New Bedford & Taunton was one of them. The conductor summoned reinforcements to eject Ruggles. He put up a fight, and had the bruises and torn clothes to show for it. His baggage went on to Boston. He went to New Bedford to file a formal claim of assault against the railroad company and the men who had manhandled him.\nAt a two-day trial before New Bedford police judge Henry H. Crapo, the railroad president testified that the company\u2019s rule benefited everyone because it \u201cseparated the drunken, dirty, ragged and colored people from the others.\u201d Ruggles told the judge that he saw no benefit in paying $2 to sit with the drunken, dirty and ragged. He had paid full price \u2014 the same price as white passengers \u2014 and that should give him the same privileges. But none of his arguments moved Crapo. The railroad was entitled, the judge said, to make and enforce whatever rules it deemed necessary. \u201cThe cars are the property of the stockholders, and as such are private property,\u201d Crapo declared.\nCrapo\u2019s ruling brought a vehement denunciation from William Lloyd Garrison, editor of the abolitionist newspaper the Liberator. Garrison took to its pages to censure Crapo for \u201cgiving his legal sanction to the dastardly assault and battery.\u201d In an accompanying article, Ruggles pronounced the trial \u201cthe greatest farce I ever witnessed.\u201d\nLess than two weeks later, with his railroad battle still a fresh wound, Ruggles was the guest of honor at a gala dinner celebrating his contributions to the abolitionist cause. \u201cAction is everything,\u201d he exhorted his admirers, a mixed gathering of whites and blacks. \u201cWith it, we are successful. Without it, all our enthusiasm is worse than nothing.\u201d\nAction came in many forms. Two weeks after the gala dinner, the conductor and crew on the Eastern Rail Road found themselves face-to-face with resistance in the imposing form of Frederick Douglass and a white abolitionist named John Collins, the general agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society.\nThe Eastern had extended its Salem line to Portsmouth, N.H., 16 miles north of the Massachusetts border. Grateful passengers included Collins, whose travel time to abolitionist chapters in southern New Hampshire had shrunk dramatically. On Sept. 8, 1841, Collins was heading there for an annual meeting, accompanied by Douglass, the Anti-Slavery Society\u2019s newest employee and rising star. Less than a month before, Douglass had transfixed the abolitionists\u2019 midsummer gathering with a spontaneous, eloquent description of his days in slavery. Almost instantly, he went from obscurity to symbol, a flesh-and-blood example of the wonders that abolition could bring.\nThe traveling duo were an unusual pair \u2014 the excitable, unimposing Collins, seven or eight years older, born in Vermont, known for his sarcastic pen and long face; the stern-eyed, broad-shouldered Douglass, not quite 24, new to anti-slavery politics. But the Eastern conductor had his eye on the only contrast that mattered: Collins was white, Douglass was not.\nWhen the conductor ordered them to separate, Douglass stayed put. The conductor laid down the usual ultimatum: the Jim Crow car or ejection. Collins demanded to know the basis for the conductor\u2019s directive. The conductor ripped down a posted placard from the car\u2019s entrance and thrust it toward them. Collins treated the placard\u2019s words as one more debating point, arguing that the rule violated the state constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal rights. But he and Douglass proved no match for the half-dozen men who seized Douglass and dragged him out of the car.\nThen, a complicating sequence of events for the exasperated conductor: Another abolitionist on the train, George Foster, announced his intention to join Douglass in his exile from the whites-only car. The conductor stood firm against this unexpected challenge, telling Foster that he \u201cwas not black enough to sit there.\u201d Foster fumed, but retreated.\nThe next day at the meeting in New Hampshire, Collins and Douglass ignited the assembled with their account. Soon, the abolitionists had more than another outrage to discuss. Thanks to Ruggles and Douglass, they now had a rallying cry and a new cause: Ban the \u201cdirt car,\u201d as it was also known. Send Jim Crow, they demanded, to the \u201creceptacle of forgotten barbarisms.\u201d\nTraveling white and black abolitionists now demanded to sit together, in one car or the other. The tactic of \u201cbearing witness\u201d introduced a new level of danger into every encounter.\nThe fall of 1841 brought more clashes on the Eastern and New Bedford railways. Traveling white and black abolitionists now demanded to sit together, in one car or the other. The tactic of \u201cbearing witness,\u201d either by protesting an eviction or by trying to join the ejected traveler in the other car, introduced a new level of danger into every encounter.\nOn Sept. 28, Collins met Douglass and two white abolitionists \u2014 a female friend of Collins\u2019s, and James N. Buffum, secretary of the Anti-Slavery Society\u2019s chapter in Lynn \u2014 at the Lynn station for a trip to Newburyport, near the Massachusetts-New Hampshire line. The foursome planted themselves in the whites-only car, known as \u201cthe long car.\u201d Douglass regarded the Eastern long cars as \u201cone of the best railroad carriages\u201d then in operation, with \u201cluxuriant and beautiful\u201d seats. The enraged conductor ordered Douglass out. When Buffum described his intention to go with Douglass, the conductor set down his marker: \u201cI\u2019d as soon haul you out of his car, as I\u2019d haul him from this.\u201d\nDouglass refused to budge. Six men were needed to oust him. \u201cThey clutched me, head, neck, and shoulders,\u201d Douglass wrote later. \u201cBut, in anticipation of the stretching to which I was about to be subjected, I had interwoven myself among the seats. In dragging me out, on this occasion, it must have cost the company twenty-five or thirty dollars, for I tore up seats and all.\u201d At the next stop, his white companions were forced to leave the train as well.\nBuffum complained to the Eastern superintendent, Stephen Chase, whose name appeared on the train\u2019s placard of rules. Buffum and Chase belonged to the same Quaker meeting house, and their relationship was already strained. In the pages of the Liberator, Chase had been attacked as a hypocrite, a Quaker who believed in the inhumane treatment of his passengers.\nBuffum confronted Chase with a Quaker-flavored accusation, as recounted in a 1922 history of the Eastern Rail Road: \u201cStephen, I don\u2019t think thee does right to utilize a Jim Crow car on thy train.\u201d Chase fired back with his own charge of hypocrisy: \u201cWell, James, I\u2019ll tell thee, when thee abolishes the colored pews in the meeting house, then I\u2019ll abolish the Jim Crow car.\u201d\nBy the following week, the uproar had bloomed into a full-flowered controversy. A hastily organized town meeting in Lynn ended with resolutions denouncing the railroad and Chase, as well as a call for a boycott unless the railroad changed its policy. Chase, claiming he was trying to avoid trouble, came up with a bold idea: He ordered the trains not to stop at the Lynn station, where Douglass frequently climbed aboard.\nThe plan backfired. Irate Lynn passengers, their travel arrangements disrupted, turned on the railroad. The editor of the Lynn Record dismissed Chase\u2019s fear of \u201cmob violence\u201d as a pretense designed to \u201cenlist the sympathies of the people, and to turn their indignation from themselves.\u201d Chase quickly rescinded his order.\nThe abolitionists celebrated the turn of events. \u201cI am convinced that the agitation growing out of these incidents will do much good,\u201d Buffum wrote to the Liberator, now filled every week with a running chronicle of fresh indignities on the Eastern and New Bedford lines. \u201cIndeed, everywhere I go, I hear men and women talking of these shameful transgressions.\u201d\nAfter three years of relative obscurity, the issue of separate railroad cars had vaulted to the top of the abolitionist agenda, reaching parity with the other issues then consuming the movement: petitioning Congress to outlaw slavery in the District of Columbia; protesting the return of fugitives to their Southern masters; ending Massachusetts\u2019s ban on intermarriage.\nDozens of petitions went to the legislature, calling for a law that would forbid separate cars. The most prominent one, signed by Garrison, Collins and Douglass, minced no words. Legislation was needed so that railroads \u201cmay no longer claim the right\u201d of assigning seats \u201con the sole ground of a difference in color,\u201d and to stop railroad employees from \u201cinsulting, assaulting and ejecting white passengers\u201d who objected.\nThat drew several counter-petitions from groups of white passengers, including one arguing that their \u201ccomfort and convenience\u201d would be seriously diminished if they had to share \u201cthe company of blacks.\u201d On an early November evening in 1841, Douglass challenged a rapt audience from the Anti-Slavery Society\u2019s Plymouth chapter to see the insidiousness of Northern-style prejudice: \u201cPeople in general will say they like colored men as well as any other, but in their proper place. Who is to decide what is their proper place?\u201d\nThe outcome of the looming legislative battle was not at all certain. Most legislators stood against slavery, but opposing the South\u2019s \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d did not translate to a belief that freedom meant the right to mix freely with whites in the North. There were plenty of legislators who viewed anyone of color as inferior, who felt no law could undo what God and nature had created.\nThe scene that unfolded in the Massachusetts House of Representatives on Feb. 10, 1842, came with no precedent. A special joint committee, chaired by an abolitionist senator from Plymouth, had granted a full hearing to the petitioners seeking a ban on separate cars. Word had gotten out: A man of color would be testifying.\nCurious spectators, including legislators, crowded into the cavernous hall. Few in the crowd needed an introduction to the first witness. Wendell Phillips was the son of a former Boston mayor and at 30 years old already among the most prominent of New England abolitionists. Like Garrison and Collins, he had shown his support for black passengers by attempting to ride with them in the separate car. His protest had led the National Anti-Slavery Standard to exclaim that separation on railroads would end if only 10 other \u201cpatricians\u201d would join Phillips in the Jim Crow coaches.\nHis rousing oratories had mesmerized even the most lukewarm slavery opponents. He drew on those skills in delivering an impassioned 90-minute plea against separation. \u201cThere are those who consider this a trifling matter,\u201d Phillips told the white men arrayed before him. \u201cTo the colored citizen, sir, it is not so.\u201d A white passenger could not begin to understand \u201cthe inconvenience, the wrong, the disgrace, the insult and suffering of these unconstitutional bylaws of corporations.\u201d\nPhillips took direct aim at Judge Crapo\u2019s ruling against Ruggles: Yes, the railroads might be privately owned, as Crapo had noted, but they were public in every way that mattered. They operated with a public charter. They laid their tracks with public loans from the state treasury, on public rights of way. They are, Phillips told the committee, \u201ccreatures of your own enactment.\u201d\nAs Phillips sat down, to murmurs of approval, the crowd craned for a good look at the next witness: Charles Lenox Remond, who had come to offer a firsthand account of one black citizen\u2019s travels on the Eastern Rail Road. A year older than Phillips, Remond was no stranger to the abolitionists in the hall. He had just returned from a 19-month lecture tour of Britain and Ireland that had brought him acclaim and a place of honor at the Anti-Slavery Society\u2019s annual meeting two weeks earlier.\nBut to most in the crowd, Remond was an unknown. A spectator muttered contemptuously to a correspondent for a New York abolitionist newspaper, \u201cHe will have to ask his master what to say.\u201d After Remond had finished, the correspondent asked the spectator what he thought now. \u201cWhy, I think,\u201d said the spectator, \u201cthe colored man is the ablest man of the two.\u201d\nRemond\u2019s travels abroad gave him an unusual perspective, and he shrewdly made the most of it. On trains and steamboats in Europe, in hotels and on the street, he said, \u201cin no instance was I insulted, or treated in any way distinct or dissimilar from other passengers or travelers.\u201d Yet on his return to Boston, just before Christmas 1841, he was immediately reminded of his inferior status in the land of his birth. Buying a one-price-fits-all ticket to Salem, where his parents lived, he was ushered to a dismal, dirty car. Europe suddenly seemed very far away. \u201cI took my seat peaceably,\u201d he told the committee, \u201cunwilling to descend so low as to bandy words with the superintendents or contest my rights with conductors.\u201d\nA few days later, Remond continued, he ran into Eastern superintendent Stephen Chase. The two men knew each other from growing up in Salem. Chase asked Remond if he was glad to be home after such a lengthy absence and was taken aback by Remond\u2019s tart answer: \u201cI never felt to loathe my American name so much as since my arrival.\u201d Remond asked Chase how separation would make him feel \u2014 if, for example, passengers with red hair, like Chase, had to ride separately. Chase \u201ccould make no reply.\u201d\nRemond then drove his point home to the committee. He had no control over his skin color, just as Chase had none over the color of his hair. \u201cComplexion,\u201d Remond said, \u201ccan in no sense be construed into crime, much less be rightfully made the criterion of rights.\u201d\nThe newspaper reports reflected the usual split in public opinion. One Boston correspondent called Remond\u2019s delivery \u201cgraceful and pointed\u201d and surmised that \u201cequal justice\u201d would prevail. The Liberator, with its usual enthusiasm, published verbatim accounts of the testimony. The correspondent for the Hampshire Gazette, meanwhile, complained sourly about these \u201cpetty\u201d petitions of \u201ctrifling importance\u201d taking up the legislature\u2019s time. Several newspapers carried nothing at all.\nAnother famous son of Boston, Charles Francis Adams, watched the Phillips and Remond testimony with keen interest. In only his second year as a member of the Massachusetts House, Adams had decidedly mixed feelings about what to do about separate railroad cars. He deplored the practice but had grave misgivings about the precedent that would be set if the legislature intervened in the affairs of corporations. After listening to Phillips and Remond, Adams wrote in his diary, \u201cI was disappointed at the general character of the argument and my mind was in greater doubt than ever.\u201d\nDoubt was a place where Adams often dwelled. Other members of Boston\u2019s elite families had donned the abolitionist label in recent years and were wearing it with pride. Not Adams. He was staunchly anti-slavery and would later lead a wing of the Whig Party into a national anti-slavery role. But he rejected immediate abolition as a solution.\nUntil he had bowed to the Whig Party\u2019s entreaties to join its ticket, Adams had spent a good portion of his first 33 years looking for an escape from his presumed destiny. The Adams clan was as close to aristocracy as any in the young republic, and Charles felt every ounce of that weight. He revered his grandfather, John Adams, the nation\u2019s second president, and loved and respected his father, the nation\u2019s sixth. Charles wrote often in his diary of his ambition to leave his own mark in the world. But he claimed to detest the profession that had made his family so influential \u2014 not just the practice of it, but everything about it.\nAdams valued independence more than any cause. He was generally an abolitionist ally, but hardly a reliable one. After hearing out yet another abolitionist appeal for help, he scribbled in his diary, \u201cI am willing to advance their principles as far as I can approve them but I will not consent to make myself their slave.\u201d\nThree weeks after the Phillips-Remond testimony, the special legislative committee on separate railroad cars issued its much-anticipated report. It could not have been more favorable if the abolitionists had drafted it themselves.\nIt did not matter, the report said, that some passengers preferred separation. The Massachusetts Constitution had decreed equal rights \u2014 at least for its male citizens \u2014 and that meant no discrimination by color, descent or religious sect. The committee recommended a bill making railroads liable for criminal penalties if they discriminated. The proposal brought a howl of protest from one state senator, who warned that \u201cthis foolish mixing\u201d would spread to theaters, hotels and other public places.\nA final vote on repealing the intermarriage ban came up first. It passed the state Senate by a comfortable margin but failed in the House by four votes. Adams, who had spoken out in favor of the repeal, wasn\u2019t surprised. He had felt the House\u2019s mood shifting after the Boston Advertiser had come out for keeping the ban. \u201cSo hard it is in a community to do away with a deep rooted prejudice,\u201d he wrote in his diary.\nThe Senate, meanwhile, saved Adams from having to decide on the separate car bill. Opponents, sensing they now had the votes to put the issue on hold, moved for an indefinite postponement. They won, 18 to 13.\nGarrison wrote bitterly of the dual defeat: \u201cHumanity and Liberty have yet a mighty work to accomplish in Massachusetts.\u201d A month later, he debuted a new tactic in the Liberator: a \u201ctraveller\u2019s directory.\u201d Modeled after the train timetables, the directory informed passengers of how they could expect to be treated on each of the state\u2019s railways.\nOn the Boston and Lowell: \u201chumanity respected.\u201d\nOn the Western: \u201cequality of privileges.\u201d\nOn the Eastern: \u201can odious distinction on account of color, and a bullying propensity to carry it out.\u201d\nAnother year of confrontations did not eliminate Adams\u2019s doubts about the railroad bill. As the 1843 session got underway, his attention was elsewhere, primarily on the George Latimer fugitive case. A Virginia slaveholder, claiming ownership of Latimer, had asked Massachusetts to hold Latimer and return him, no questions asked. This was a matter that went directly to the heart of the country\u2019s great national divide: Could a Northern state be forced, against the principles of its own constitution, to comply with a slave owner\u2019s request? Adams, who was heading the legislative committee investigating the Latimer case, had no misgivings on this issue. He favored enactment of a \u201cpersonal liberty\u201d law that would prohibit the use of any Massachusetts property or official in a Southerner\u2019s hunt for a runaway slave.\nThe Latimer case stirred public opinion like none other. At the end of January 1843, two men, using a stretcher resting on their shoulders, carried petitions into the State House bearing an astounding 64,000 signatures, more than 10 percent of the state\u2019s adult population. The abolitionists who orchestrated the event asked Adams to make the formal presentation to the House. \u201cThis is perhaps the most memorable event of my life,\u201d Adams wrote that night. \u201cI feel some degree of pride in the fact that I was selected for such a purpose.\u201d\nHe felt nothing of the sort about the railroad bill, and wished the legislation would disappear. But like a conductor enforcing the separate car rules, he found confrontation hard to avoid. The climactic moment came on Feb. 6, 1843, a cloudy Monday, one week after his Latimer triumph. The House took up the railroad bill for a final debate. After a divisive discussion that pitted Whig against Whig, Democrat against Democrat, Adams reluctantly rose to his feet. He had made up his mind to vote against the bill. But he was eager to avoid saying so publicly, given the \u201cstrong undercurrent of prejudice\u201d in the opposition\u2019s speeches. Desperate to find an alternate path, he fell back on a direct appeal to the railroads themselves.\nThere was no question in his mind, Adams told his House colleagues, that the legislature \u201chad the right\u201d to pass a bill. But \u201cit would be a kind of entering wedge to a general interference with the charters of all corporations,\u201d and he did not think that approach was wise. With a dramatic air, he turned to the legislative reporters and instructed them to write down his words precisely. Perhaps the offending railroads, he said, \u201cwould take the advice of a humble member of the House\u201d and voluntarily rescind their bylaws allowing separate cars. That would \u201csave the necessity of a resort to legislation.\u201d\nSwiftly, the House seized on Adams\u2019s artful dodge, postponing any action by an overwhelming margin, 171 to 61. The railroads, saved from state interference, took Adams\u2019s hint: By the end of 1843, the Jim Crow cars were gone from the state\u2019s railways.\nWithout question, the abolitionists had won a victory. Still, it was a small blow against the entrenched view among many Northern whites that separation was best for all concerned. Over the next few decades, action came often, in new forms, from new resisters. Their legal challenges met with hostility and ended mostly in rejection, but they kept coming, even in the face of violence.\nIn 1849, the Massachusetts Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit protesting separate schools, prompting a campaign that ended six years later with a landmark state law prohibiting the use of \u201crace, color or religious opinions\u201d in admitting students to public schools. In 1858, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld a steamboat company\u2019s refusal to sell a cabin berth to black abolitionist William Howard Day. In 1867, as the states were ratifying a new constitutional amendment with an equal protection clause, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed a bitter defeat to teacher Mary Miles, who was ejected from a West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad train for refusing to leave the whites-only car. All cases from the North, all later cited by the U.S. Supreme Court in its infamous 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling, written by a New England-born justice for a 7-1 majority dominated by Northerners.\nGeorge Peabody\u2019s rosy prediction had no chance of coming true. It takes more than a national network of railroad lines to \u201csubdue local prejudices.\u201d It takes \u2014 today as in 1838 \u2014 laws, people, action, resistance, perseverance. In the case of the U.S. courts, it requires a willingness to revisit rulings, overturn mistakes and look with fresh eyes at the fear, anger and prejudice that persists from the nation\u2019s legacy of racial separation and prolonged injustice.\nSteve Luxenberg is a Washington Post associate editor.

                "html": "<p>TRAILING IN the polls, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is running ahead of the Democratic presidential pack in terms of policy specifics. We hope other candidates will emulate her willingness to lay out an agenda. Alas, her latest big idea &mdash; to eliminate vast quantities of student debt and make public universities tuition-free &mdash; is not a sound idea.</p>\n<p>The nation&rsquo;s households owe almost $1.5 trillion in student loans, <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/research/2019/20190212\">according to</a> the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This represents a burden on many families, which, under <a href=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f\">Ms. Warren&rsquo;s</a> <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elizabeth-warren-its-time-to-end-the-failed-experiment-that-caused-the-student-debt-crisis-and-cancel-borrowers-debt-2019-04-22\">plan</a>, would disappear completely for 75 percent of them, and at least partially for 95 percent. That&rsquo;s because she would forgive debts up to $50,000 &mdash; just over twice the average federal student loan balance, <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/npsas/tablesaddl.asp\">$23,000</a>. And she would do so for borrowers with a household income under $100,000 &mdash; some 80 percent of the population. Even borrowers earning up to $250,000 would be eligible for some relief, which would total $640 billion overall. Free college would add $600 billion or so more, for a total price tag over 10 years of $1.25 trillion.</p>\n<p>No one can accuse Ms. Warren of thinking small. What she really needs is a better sense of proportion. Her premise seems to be that student debt is all burden and no benefit, but this is not true: It represents an investment in skill acquisition that pays substantial long-term benefits. <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160718_cea_student_debt.pdf\">President Barack Obama&rsquo;s</a> Council of Economic Advisers <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-truth-about-higher-ed_b_11060192\">estimated</a> this lifetime &ldquo;earnings premium&rdquo; at about $1 million over a worker with only a high school education. It&rsquo;s not unfair to expect people to pay back their loans out of that income. What might be unfair is debt relief to the exclusion of other priorities with wider benefits, including to people who did not go to college at all. Ms. Warren proposes a wealth tax to cover the cost, the proceeds of which would then not be available for alternative, possibly more progressive uses. In any case, default rates are actually falling slightly, <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/national-student-loan-cohort-default-rate-falls\">according to</a> the latest Education Department figures; 84.7 percent of borrowers were current on their obligations as of the end of 2017, <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/topics/student-debt\">according to</a> the New York Fed.</p>\n<p>As for tuition-free college, why should children of families in the upper reaches of the income distribution scale receive an income-enhancing state-university education for nothing, when their parents are perfectly capable of helping defray the cost?</p>\n<p>Other Democrats have, quite properly, raised feasibility concerns about Ms. Warren&rsquo;s plan. &ldquo;I have to be straight with you and tell you the truth,&rdquo; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told a group of New Hampshire students recently, in explaining why <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/04/23/amy-klobuchar-town-hall-cnn/\">she wouldn&rsquo;t match</a> Ms. Warren&rsquo;s offer. For us, though, policy priority is the essential concern. Student-loan defaults are concentrated among students who attended for-profit institutions, or who accumulated low loan balances but then dropped out and were stuck paying the money back out of lower-than-anticipated earnings. Such issues are hardest for students and families of color, as Ms. Warren correctly emphasized. This calls for a targeted approach that relieves the worst financial stress of those least able to handle it, not a sweeping bailout for the middle class and above.</p>",

                "text": "TRAILING IN the polls, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is running ahead of the Democratic presidential pack in terms of policy specifics. We hope other candidates will emulate her willingness to lay out an agenda. Alas, her latest big idea \u2014 to eliminate vast quantities of student debt and make public universities tuition-free \u2014 is not a sound idea.\nThe nation\u2019s households owe almost $1.5 trillion in student loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This represents a burden on many families, which, under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, would disappear completely for 75 percent of them, and at least partially for 95 percent. That\u2019s because she would forgive debts up to $50,000 \u2014 just over twice the average federal student loan balance, $23,000. And she would do so for borrowers with a household income under $100,000 \u2014 some 80 percent of the population. Even borrowers earning up to $250,000 would be eligible for some relief, which would total $640 billion overall. Free college would add $600 billion or so more, for a total price tag over 10 years of $1.25 trillion.\nNo one can accuse Ms. Warren of thinking small. What she really needs is a better sense of proportion. Her premise seems to be that student debt is all burden and no benefit, but this is not true: It represents an investment in skill acquisition that pays substantial long-term benefits. President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers estimated this lifetime \u201cearnings premium\u201d at about $1 million over a worker with only a high school education. It\u2019s not unfair to expect people to pay back their loans out of that income. What might be unfair is debt relief to the exclusion of other priorities with wider benefits, including to people who did not go to college at all. Ms. Warren proposes a wealth tax to cover the cost, the proceeds of which would then not be available for alternative, possibly more progressive uses. In any case, default rates are actually falling slightly, according to the latest Education Department figures; 84.7 percent of borrowers were current on their obligations as of the end of 2017, according to the New York Fed.\nAs for tuition-free college, why should children of families in the upper reaches of the income distribution scale receive an income-enhancing state-university education for nothing, when their parents are perfectly capable of helping defray the cost?\nOther Democrats have, quite properly, raised feasibility concerns about Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. \u201cI have to be straight with you and tell you the truth,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told a group of New Hampshire students recently, in explaining why she wouldn\u2019t match Ms. Warren\u2019s offer. For us, though, policy priority is the essential concern. Student-loan defaults are concentrated among students who attended for-profit institutions, or who accumulated low loan balances but then dropped out and were stuck paying the money back out of lower-than-anticipated earnings. Such issues are hardest for students and families of color, as Ms. Warren correctly emphasized. This calls for a targeted approach that relieves the worst financial stress of those least able to handle it, not a sweeping bailout for the middle class and above.",

                "html": "<p>The president needs an economist. Not just any economist; he desperately needs a game theorist, someone who can impress upon him why the negotiating strategy that has (mostly) served him well in his private business utterly fails him now.</p>\n<p>Specifically: He needs someone to explain &ldquo;repeated play&rdquo;&mdash; and the idea that players may want to strategize differently if they&rsquo;re going to face off multiple times rather than just once.</p>\n<p>On Friday, Trump got into a bizarre and awkward public debate with his own U.S. trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer. On <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4781779/president-trade-representative-lighthizer-differ-mous-trade-talks\">live television</a>, and in front of a laughing Chinese envoy, Lighthizer and Trump argued about whether the &ldquo;memorandums of understanding&rdquo; that the United States and China have spent weeks negotiating would be meaningful and enforceable. Lighthizer said an &ldquo;MOU&rdquo; is &ldquo;a binding agreement between two people.&rdquo; Trump contradicted him, saying of MOUs: &ldquo;To me they don&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To many, the argument was just another example of White House disarray and amateurism. But Trump&rsquo;s comments also offer useful insight into the central defect of our dealmaker in chief&rsquo;s dealmaking strategy.</p>\n<p>Trump isn&rsquo;t technically wrong about an MOU&rsquo;s legal enforceability, by the way.

                "text": "The president needs an economist. Not just any economist; he desperately needs a game theorist, someone who can impress upon him why the negotiating strategy that has (mostly) served him well in his private business utterly fails him now.\nSpecifically: He needs someone to explain \u201crepeated play\u201d\u2014 and the idea that players may want to strategize differently if they\u2019re going to face off multiple times rather than just once.\nOn Friday, Trump got into a bizarre and awkward public debate with his own U.S. trade representative, Robert E. Lighthizer. On live television, and in front of a laughing Chinese envoy, Lighthizer and Trump argued about whether the \u201cmemorandums of understanding\u201d that the United States and China have spent weeks negotiating would be meaningful and enforceable. Lighthizer said an \u201cMOU\u201d is \u201ca binding agreement between two people.\u201d Trump contradicted him, saying of MOUs: \u201cTo me they don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\nTo many, the argument was just another example of White House disarray and amateurism. But Trump\u2019s comments also offer useful insight into the central defect of our dealmaker in chief\u2019s dealmaking strategy.\nTrump isn\u2019t technically wrong about an MOU\u2019s legal enforceability, by the way. There is no external enforcement mechanism with an MOU; instead, it\u2019s a statement that two sides want to do business together, under given terms. It\u2019s essentially an honor-bound agreement that a relationship will commence or continue.\nFor this and arguably most kinds of transactions \u2014 whether handshake deals or even written contracts \u2014 the most effective enforcement mechanism is not some threat of penalties imposed by a third party, but rather the desire by both partners to maintain their relationship and their reputations.\nIt doesn\u2019t take a PhD to understand why Trump would be predisposed to find such agreements worthless.\nThroughout his career, Trump clearly viewed his business deals as one-off transactions, in which he should try to extract as much as he could today and assume no future relationship tomorrow. In literally hundreds of cases, he is alleged to have reneged on money owed to plumbers, carpenters, caterers, even bankers.\nTo Trump, there was always an infinite supply of bridges (and bridge loans) to burn.\nAnd for the most part, this strategy worked, so long as the carpenter and caterer in Florida didn\u2019t talk to their counterparts in New Jersey. Later in his career, his reputation did seem to catch up with him, as he found it harder to get financing. Turns out word gets around with Wall Street bankers.\nNonetheless, you can see these private-sector lessons in how Trump approaches dealmaking at the White House.\nWhether negotiating with trading partners or congressional Democrats, Trump seems to have trouble envisioning the negative consequences if he defects from a deal he has already struck. But negotiating on behalf of the United States is different from negotiating a one-off contract with a plumber.\nIn government, there is necessarily repeated play; there is no inexhaustible supply of sovereign nations or political parties to haggle with. Trump must sit across the table from the same counterparties, again and again. Trump appears not to realize that if he doesn\u2019t keep his (or his country\u2019s) word this time, it will be harder to make a deal next time. Even if a next deal is struck, he has made it more likely that the other side will defect when convenient, too.\nTrump may well be correct to distrust China\u2019s commitment to keeping its word, whether in an MOU or an \u201cagreement\u201d (as U.S. officials are newly rebranding the documents, apparently at Trump\u2019s request). But over the years, we\u2019ve built up strong relationships with our allies, who might be inclined to help us keep China in line. Instead, we\u2019re alienating them by reneging on other international agreements: on climate change, a Pacific Rim trade pact, the Iran deal.\nWe have also levied arbitrary tariffs upon them, citing nonsense \u201cnational security\u201d rationales when Trump admits the real aim is to gain leverage in trade negotiations. Even when a trade deal has been struck, as in the case of NAFTA 2.0, Trump still declined to lift metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico as promised. Presumably the European Union \u2014 which Trump is threatening with \u201cnational security\u201d tariffs on autos to improve his bargaining position in a separate negotiation \u2014 paid attention to this outcome and will adjust its strategy accordingly.\nAnd meanwhile, as experts observed at a trade conference I attended here over the weekend, it\u2019s likely no mere coincidence that other countries are pulling out of other international pacts, or eyeing \u201cnational security\u201d as an excuse to skirt their own trade obligations.\nTo the United States\u2019 great peril, we\u2019ve treated our longtime friends like Trump\u2019s many one-time contractors.

The massive, peaceful rallies exceeded the expectations of most observers of Algeria and of the broader Middle East. The protests focused on rejecting a fifth term for Bouteflika but could easily evolve into wider demands.</p>\n<p>Algeria&rsquo;s unrest erupted in the shadow of long-lasting, highly consequential <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/28/recent-protests-in-sudan-are-much-more-than-bread-riots/?utm_term=.6426f70fc471&tid=lk_inline_manual_3\">protests</a> in Sudan against long-ruling President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. While initially understood as protests against food prices, Sudan&rsquo;s protests quickly focused on political repression and Bashir&rsquo;s decades of governance failure. The protests expanded far beyond the usual precincts, taking hold across the country and in a wide variety of sectors. Last week, Bashir defied reports that he would not seek another term in 2020 by declaring a state of emergency and escalating violent repression of protesters.</p>\n<p>The simultaneous eruption and gathering momentum of the Algerian and Sudanese protests inevitably bring comparisons with the 2011 Arab uprisings. Could Algeria and Sudan be the trigger for a regionwide <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/11/where-us-middle-east/574747/\">protest wave</a> comparable to the one ignited by Tunisia&rsquo;s revolution? That may be the wrong question.</p>\n<p>Algeria and Sudan are part of a broader sequence of popular protest movements that hit more than a third of the countries in the region over the past two years. For the most part, these protests are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/25/why-social-policy-is-at-the-heart-of-political-protests-in-the-middle-east/?utm_term=.38ba4b23d35e&tid=lk_inline_manual_8\">responses</a> to similar governance and economic problems and not evidence of diffusion across borders. Arab autocrats have spent the past eight years attempting to rewire the region&rsquo;s media and politics to prevent precisely such diffusion.</p>\n<p>Before the Arab uprisings, analysts tended to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/02/what-are-the-lessons-of-the-arab-uprisings-for-irans-protests/?utm_term=.fd40b3f69f0c&tid=lk_inline_manual_9\">underpredict</a> revolutionary political change. Since those disruptive events, they have tended to <a href=\"https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/75231\">overpredict</a> upheaval. But that should not reassure those who crave stability, or overly discourage those who seek change. The political, economic and social challenges facing almost every Middle Eastern regime today are worse by orders of magnitude than they were in 2011 &mdash; and the <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/specialprojects/arabhorizons\">structural factors</a> enabling protest contagion remain potent.</p>\n<p>The protests in Algeria and Sudan are far from the first episodes of political unrest in the Middle East in recent years. Last summer, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/11/how-violent-protests-in-iraq-could-escalate/?utm_term=.a2db4fec5b75&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">again in the fall</a>, massive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/09/14/who-to-blame-for-the-protests-in-basra-iraq/?tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">protests</a> swept through <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/07/21/protests-are-mounting-in-iraq-why/?utm_term=.0dbb9300f6db&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">southern Iraq</a>. Major protests hit <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/19/why-do-tunisians-keep-protesting/?tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Tunisia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/06/04/why-jordanians-are-protesting/?utm_term=.da658d2e05b9&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Jordan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/01/12/what-data-show-us-about-irans-protests/?utm_term=.15091fd7df3f&tid=a_inl_manual&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Iran</a> last winter. A similar round of protests in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/05/moroccos-protesters-show-no-sign-of-letting-up-will-their-movement-spread/?utm_term=.ac7f92601f4e&tid=lk_inline_manual_12\">Morocco</a>, which began in the fall of 2016, persisted for many months.</p>\n<p>Seven of 21 states (including the Palestinian Authority) conventionally defined as being in the Middle East have therefore experienced a major protest event in the past several years. Shattered states such as Syria, Yemen and Libya were hardly candidates for peaceful protest in the midst of ruinous civil wars. Qatar and the UAE are too wealthy, small and internally strong to face any credible prospect of domestic unrest. Turkey&rsquo;s failed coup attempt in July 2016 created intensely repressive new dynamics which superseded protest possibilities. Depending on how one counts, then, nearly half of eligible Middle Eastern states have already experienced significant protests in the past few years.</p>\n<p>These widely dispersed protests are probably underestimated as a <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-10-15/next-arab-uprising\">regional pattern</a> because it has not yet led to the overthrow of any entrenched leader. This is the <a href=\"https://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/75231\">wrong way</a> to think about the significance of protests. Popular mobilization reshapes politics at all levels independently of whether it topples regimes. Other indicators are new identities, coalitions and political claims being made, how regimes attempt to adapt and respond, how expectations of political possibility change, and how the terms of political discourse evolve.</p>\n<p>The unique power of the Arab uprisings came from a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00IQY3DAG&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_XCyDCb0QPE30H&tag=thewaspos09-20\">scale shift</a>,&rdquo; in which a shared identity brought together local challenges into a collective regional narrative. This sense of a single common struggle, playing out across a shared broadcast and online media, allowed Yemenis and Bahrainis to draw inspiration and protest tactics from Egypt and Tunisia. That emotional force provided power beyond any local capabilities.</p>\n<p>Even though the demands of today&rsquo;s protesters are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/10/25/why-social-policy-is-at-the-heart-of-political-protests-in-the-middle-east/?tid=lk_inline_manual_19\">very similar</a> across borders, they have rarely been framed in that way as a common struggle. That is partly because of their scattered emergence. But it is also because since 2011, Arab regimes have <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2018-08-13/new-arab-order\">lived in fear</a> of the sudden diffusion of unrest. Rulers learned then that protests elsewhere in the region could suddenly generate massive, unexpected protest energy that could overwhelm their defenses.</p>\n<p>Preventing such <a href=\"https://pomeps.org/2016/08/24/transnational-diffusion/\">diffusion and contagion</a> became a top priority for regional regimes. They cooperate to defend regimes threatened by popular unrest through such means as financial assistance and political support because they view revolution anywhere as a potential threat to their own regime survival. They reshaped the media landscape to encourage polarization and discourage mobilization, while aggressively expanding surveillance and manipulation into the social media space. A rare exception was Iran, where Gulf regimes and their media certainly encouraged last winter&rsquo;s protests in hopes of challenging their rivals in Tehran, but to little effect.</p>\n<p>Failures of the Arab uprisings since 2011 have left deep scars on societies and individuals that impede shared regional narratives. Polarization that ripped apart so many countries left suspicions and hardened identities that are not easily left behind. With democratic transitions discredited, there are no clear visions on offer for positive change. Many activists have suffered enormously from prison, torture and exile. And nearly every regime&rsquo;s security services are far more brutal in their repression and attuned to any signal of real danger.</p>\n<p>Despite those very real inhibitors to a new regional protest wave, the deep drivers of instability and popular unrest across the region are clear. As economic and demographic challenges mount, and political institutions have been stripped of legitimacy, regimes that are already exercising maximal repression have few options for escalation. Even if protests will not diffuse as easily as they did in 2011, there are always potential triggering events &mdash; the death of an aging leader, controversial constitutional changes, unavoidable subsidy cuts, even the end of civil wars &mdash; lurking on the horizon.</p>",

With democratic transitions discredited, there are no clear visions on offer for positive change. Many activists have suffered enormously from prison, torture and exile. And nearly every regime\u2019s security services are far more brutal in their repression and attuned to any signal of real danger.\nDespite those very real inhibitors to a new regional protest wave, the deep drivers of instability and popular unrest across the region are clear. As economic and demographic challenges mount, and political institutions have been stripped of legitimacy, regimes that are already exercising maximal repression have few options for escalation. Even if protests will not diffuse as easily as they did in 2011, there are always potential triggering events \u2014 the death of an aging leader, controversial constitutional changes, unavoidable subsidy cuts, even the end of civil wars \u2014 lurking on the horizon.",

                "html": "<p>Justice Elena Kagan has emerged as one of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s most powerful voices on the separation of church and state, often rebuking conservative colleagues for allowing government actions that she says favor one religion over another.</p>\n<p>But the last time the justices considered the fate of a cross constructed on public land, Kagan was on the other side of the bench and on one side of the issue.</p>\n<p>As President Barack Obama&rsquo;s solicitor general, Kagan successfully defended a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, convincing the court&rsquo;s conservatives that what she unwaveringly referred to as a &ldquo;war memorial&rdquo; should remain as a tribute to the sacrifice of World War I dead.</p>\n<p>There is a reboot of the issue Wednesday, this time with Kagan as a justice: another cross dedicated to Americans killed during World War I, a massive structure on public land in Maryland, about five miles northeast of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>The legal battle over the Bladensburg Peace Cross could provide sharper definition to the court&rsquo;s murky jurisprudence over when religious symbols on public land violate constitutional prohibitions on government establishment of religion. It is one of the term&rsquo;s marquee cases, and Kagan could play a pivotal role.</p>\n<p>It is an intriguing spot for the 58-year-old jurist, who was nominated by Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010 to replace retiring liberal justice John Paul Stevens. One of only four women to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan is the least in the public eye. Although she is consistently on the court&rsquo;s left, she crosses over more often than the better-known Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.</p>\n<p>But she is a favorite of those who follow and practice before the court. Lawyers who argue conservative causes say she is the justice most likely to probe the weak spots of their cases. And law professors across the ideological spectrum praise her clear and often colloquial writing style.</p>\n<p>Ginsburg, the senior justice on the left, relies on Kagan to write dissents that she and the other liberals can support , and often that happens when the disagreement is over religion.</p>\n<p>Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Justice Stephen G. Breyer joined Kagan&rsquo;s sharp dissent when the court&rsquo;s conservatives recently allowed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/supreme-courts-execution-decision-animates-critics-on-the-left-and-right/2019/02/11/72da5ed8-2e3a-11e9-813a-0ab2f17e305b_story.html?utm_term=.a41bcd60423f&tid=lk_inline_manual_14\">the execution of a Muslim prisoner in Alabama</a> who was denied his request of an imam in the death chamber.</p>\n<p>The majority&rsquo;s decision, which said Domineque Ray had filed his lawsuit too late in the process, was &ldquo;profoundly wrong.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Under Alabama&rsquo;s policy, &ldquo;a Christian prisoner may have a minister of his own faith accompany him into the execution chamber to say his last rites,&rdquo; Kagan wrote.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But if an inmate practices a different religion &mdash; whether Islam, Judaism, or any other &mdash; he may not die with a minister of his own faith by his side. That treatment goes against the Establishment Clause&rsquo;s core principle of denominational neutrality.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Kagan argued the Mojave cross case, the tables were turned. She won the support of the conservative justices and none of the liberals.</p>\n<p>It simply may have been the case of a lawyer vigorously representing a client. <i>Salazar v. Buono</i> was just the second Supreme Court case Kagan argued after being confirmed as solicitor general in 2009. Told by courts that the small cross erected decades before must come down, Kagan was defending a deal Congress had made. By swapping land on which the cross stood for private property elsewhere in the preserve, the cross would be on privately held land, Kagan said, curing the constitutional problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about her personal views one way or the other, I just know that she was a hard worker,&rdquo; said Hiram Sasser, general counsel of the conservative legal organization First Liberty, which is also involved in the current case. The group was representing Veterans of Foreign Wars, which agreed to take over upkeep of the cross, which Congress had declared an official monument to the World War I dead. Sasser was on the team of lawyers who prepared Kagan.</p>\n<p>Dennis Schramm, then superintendent of the preserve, was surprised when he received a call saying Kagan was flying from Washington to visit the site. Years of litigation had preceded the Supreme Court fight, he said, and none of the other lawyers involved had made the trek to Sunrise Rock.</p>\n<p>Kagan&rsquo;s preparation was mentioned in a manual for Supreme Court practitioners preparing for oral argument, and she used her familiarity with the desert during her presentation to the court. &ldquo;I was out there three or four weeks ago,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The superintendent drove me to the site.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Kagan told Ginsburg it would be easy to put signs on the only road leading to the cross to make clear it was on private property. And she described how the preserve was dotted with private land holdings, more than 1,000, so a visitor was never quite clear whether she was looking at government or private property.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I certainly agree that the nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in World War I,&rdquo; Stevens wrote, &ldquo;but it cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The issue facing Kagan the justice is different from the one presented by Kagan the government lawyer. But in the small world of Supreme Court litigation, the cast is similar.</p>\n<p>Kagan will be on the bench. Her principal deputy in the solicitor general&rsquo;s office, Neal K. Katyal, is now a private lawyer representing the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which owns the highway median on which the Bladensburg Peace Cross is erected. And Jeffrey B. Wall, who accompanied Kagan to the Mojave in 2009, is the acting solicitor general in the case.</p>\n<p>The 40-foot Peace Cross, made of granite and cement, was built in 1925 as a tribute to men from Prince George&rsquo;s County, Md., who died during World War I. It was paid for by local families, businesses and the American Legion.</p>\n<p>The land on which it sits was transferred in 1961 to the government commission, which pays for its maintenance and upkeep.</p>\n<p>The cross bears a plaque listing the 49 dead; ahead of its time, it lists African Americans and whites equally. VALOR; ENDURANCE; COURAGE; DEVOTION are inscribed on its four sides. At its dedication, the monument was compared to the cross of Calvary, where Jesus was crucified, and research indicates that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/maryland-peace-cross/?utm_term=.21b63e14c0ed&tid=lk_inline_manual_41\">all of the men it honors were Christians</a>.</p>\n<p>The American Humanist Association in 2014 challenged the constitutionality of the display of the preeminent symbol of Christianity on government property.</p>\n<p>A federal district judge ruled against the organization. The Supreme Court has not ruled out historical displays of religious symbols, the judge said, adding that it met the court&rsquo;s test of having a secular purpose, that its &ldquo;primary effect&rdquo; was religious neutrality and that there was not excessive entanglement of government and religion.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit disagreed and ordered the commission to remove, relocate or redesign the memorial.</p>\n<p>The &ldquo;sectarian elements easily overwhelm the secular ones,&rdquo; the appeals court decided, adding that &ldquo;the cross is by far the most prominent monument in the area, conspicuously displayed at a busy intersection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Few expect the more conservative Supreme Court to agree with the 4th Circuit opinion. The question is whether it will want to decide the case narrowly, under existing precedents, or develop a new test that might give more definitive guidance to lower courts and head off more case-by-case litigation.</p>\n<p>Richard Garnett, an expert on religion and constitutional law at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said Kagan might want to be a part of those efforts. Past votes have shown Kagan to be more of a stickler for denominational neutrality than of the strict boundaries of church and state separation that Ginsburg and Sotomayor have endorsed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think Justice Kagan might want to find a place in the middle that&rsquo;s more than just &lsquo;we know it when we see it,&rsquo; &rdquo; Garnett said.</p>\n<p>She wrote a <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-696\">stinging dissent</a> in 2014 when the court&rsquo;s conservatives found that prayers given almost entirely by Christian chaplains before meetings of the town council in Greece, N.Y., did not violate constitutional standards.</p>\n<p>Kagan said the town&rsquo;s practice betrayed &ldquo;the breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She suggested there were easy ways for the town to comply with constitutional standards, and that led Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to write that Kagan&rsquo;s objections were, at bottom, &ldquo;niggling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She bristled. That Alito &ldquo;thinks my objection to that is &lsquo;really quite niggling,&rsquo; says all there is to say about the difference between our respective views,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>",

                "text": "Justice Elena Kagan has emerged as one of the Supreme Court\u2019s most powerful voices on the separation of church and state, often rebuking conservative colleagues for allowing government actions that she says favor one religion over another.\nBut the last time the justices considered the fate of a cross constructed on public land, Kagan was on the other side of the bench and on one side of the issue.\nAs President Barack Obama\u2019s solicitor general, Kagan successfully defended a cross in the Mojave National Preserve, convincing the court\u2019s conservatives that what she unwaveringly referred to as a \u201cwar memorial\u201d should remain as a tribute to the sacrifice of World War I dead.\nThere is a reboot of the issue Wednesday, this time with Kagan as a justice: another cross dedicated to Americans killed during World War I, a massive structure on public land in Maryland, about five miles northeast of the Supreme Court.\nThe legal battle over the Bladensburg Peace Cross could provide sharper definition to the court\u2019s murky jurisprudence over when religious symbols on public land violate constitutional prohibitions on government establishment of religion. It is one of the term\u2019s marquee cases, and Kagan could play a pivotal role.\nIt is an intriguing spot for the 58-year-old jurist, who was nominated by Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2010 to replace retiring liberal justice John Paul Stevens. One of only four women to serve on the Supreme Court, Kagan is the least in the public eye. Although she is consistently on the court\u2019s left, she crosses over more often than the better-known Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor.\nBut she is a favorite of those who follow and practice before the court. Lawyers who argue conservative causes say she is the justice most likely to probe the weak spots of their cases. And law professors across the ideological spectrum praise her clear and often colloquial writing style.\nGinsburg, the senior justice on the left, relies on Kagan to write dissents that she and the other liberals can support , and often that happens when the disagreement is over religion.\nGinsburg, Sotomayor and Justice Stephen G. Breyer joined Kagan\u2019s sharp dissent when the court\u2019s conservatives recently allowed the execution of a Muslim prisoner in Alabama who was denied his request of an imam in the death chamber.\nThe majority\u2019s decision, which said Domineque Ray had filed his lawsuit too late in the process, was \u201cprofoundly wrong.\u201d\nUnder Alabama\u2019s policy, \u201ca Christian prisoner may have a minister of his own faith accompany him into the execution chamber to say his last rites,\u201d Kagan wrote.\n\u201cBut if an inmate practices a different religion \u2014 whether Islam, Judaism, or any other \u2014 he may not die with a minister of his own faith by his side. That treatment goes against the Establishment Clause\u2019s core principle of denominational neutrality.\u201d\nWhen Kagan argued the Mojave cross case, the tables were turned. She won the support of the conservative justices and none of the liberals.\nIt simply may have been the case of a lawyer vigorously representing a client. Salazar v. Buono was just the second Supreme Court case Kagan argued after being confirmed as solicitor general in 2009. Told by courts that the small cross erected decades before must come down, Kagan was defending a deal Congress had made. By swapping land on which the cross stood for private property elsewhere in the preserve, the cross would be on privately held land, Kagan said, curing the constitutional problem.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about her personal views one way or the other, I just know that she was a hard worker,\u201d said Hiram Sasser, general counsel of the conservative legal organization First Liberty, which is also involved in the current case. The group was representing Veterans of Foreign Wars, which agreed to take over upkeep of the cross, which Congress had declared an official monument to the World War I dead. Sasser was on the team of lawyers who prepared Kagan.\nDennis Schramm, then superintendent of the preserve, was surprised when he received a call saying Kagan was flying from Washington to visit the site. Years of litigation had preceded the Supreme Court fight, he said, and none of the other lawyers involved had made the trek to Sunrise Rock.\nKagan\u2019s preparation was mentioned in a manual for Supreme Court practitioners preparing for oral argument, and she used her familiarity with the desert during her presentation to the court. \u201cI was out there three or four weeks ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThe superintendent drove me to the site.\u201d\nKagan told Ginsburg it would be easy to put signs on the only road leading to the cross to make clear it was on private property. And she described how the preserve was dotted with private land holdings, more than 1,000, so a visitor was never quite clear whether she was looking at government or private property.\n\u201cI certainly agree that the nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in World War I,\u201d Stevens wrote, \u201cbut it cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message.\u201d\nThe issue facing Kagan the justice is different from the one presented by Kagan the government lawyer. But in the small world of Supreme Court litigation, the cast is similar.\nKagan will be on the bench. Her principal deputy in the solicitor general\u2019s office, Neal K. Katyal, is now a private lawyer representing the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which owns the highway median on which the Bladensburg Peace Cross is erected. And Jeffrey B. Wall, who accompanied Kagan to the Mojave in 2009, is the acting solicitor general in the case.\nThe 40-foot Peace Cross, made of granite and cement, was built in 1925 as a tribute to men from Prince George\u2019s County, Md., who died during World War I. It was paid for by local families, businesses and the American Legion.\nThe land on which it sits was transferred in 1961 to the government commission, which pays for its maintenance and upkeep.\nThe cross bears a plaque listing the 49 dead; ahead of its time, it lists African Americans and whites equally. VALOR; ENDURANCE; COURAGE; DEVOTION are inscribed on its four sides. At its dedication, the monument was compared to the cross of Calvary, where Jesus was crucified, and research indicates that all of the men it honors were Christians.\nThe American Humanist Association in 2014 challenged the constitutionality of the display of the preeminent symbol of Christianity on government property.\nA federal district judge ruled against the organization. The Supreme Court has not ruled out historical displays of religious symbols, the judge said, adding that it met the court\u2019s test of having a secular purpose, that its \u201cprimary effect\u201d was religious neutrality and that there was not excessive entanglement of government and religion.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit disagreed and ordered the commission to remove, relocate or redesign the memorial.\nThe \u201csectarian elements easily overwhelm the secular ones,\u201d the appeals court decided, adding that \u201cthe cross is by far the most prominent monument in the area, conspicuously displayed at a busy intersection.\u201d\nFew expect the more conservative Supreme Court to agree with the 4th Circuit opinion. The question is whether it will want to decide the case narrowly, under existing precedents, or develop a new test that might give more definitive guidance to lower courts and head off more case-by-case litigation.\nRichard Garnett, an expert on religion and constitutional law at the University of Notre Dame Law School, said Kagan might want to be a part of those efforts. Past votes have shown Kagan to be more of a stickler for denominational neutrality than of the strict boundaries of church and state separation that Ginsburg and Sotomayor have endorsed.\n\u201cI think Justice Kagan might want to find a place in the middle that\u2019s more than just \u2018we know it when we see it,\u2019 \u201d Garnett said.\nShe wrote a stinging dissent in 2014 when the court\u2019s conservatives found that prayers given almost entirely by Christian chaplains before meetings of the town council in Greece, N.Y., did not violate constitutional standards.\nKagan said the town\u2019s practice betrayed \u201cthe breathtakingly generous constitutional idea that our public institutions belong no less to the Buddhist or Hindu than to the Methodist or Episcopalian.\u201d\nShe suggested there were easy ways for the town to comply with constitutional standards, and that led Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to write that Kagan\u2019s objections were, at bottom, \u201cniggling.\u201d\nShe bristled. That Alito \u201cthinks my objection to that is \u2018really quite niggling,\u2019 says all there is to say about the difference between our respective views,\u201d she wrote.",

(Alex Brandon/AP)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>President Trump on Tuesday said he is opposed to current and former White House aides providing testimony to congressional panels in the wake of the special counsel report, intensifying a power struggle between his administration and House Democrats.</p>\n<p>In an interview with The Washington Post, Trump said that complying with congressional requests was unnecessary after the White House cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III&rsquo;s probe of Russian interference and the president&rsquo;s own conduct in office.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it&rsquo;s very partisan &mdash; obviously very partisan,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s comments came as the White House made it clear that it plans to broadly defy requests for information from Capitol Hill, moving the two branches of government closer to a constitutional collision.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, two White House officials said the administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-plans-to-fight-house-subpoena-of-former-counsel-donald-mcgahn-for-testimony-on-mueller-report/2019/04/23/2d48732a-65f1-11e9-83df-04f4d124151f_story.html?utm_term=.3dd981c2f5de&tid=lk_inline_manual_9\">plans to fight a subpoena </a>issued by the House Judiciary Committee for former White House counsel Donald McGahn by asserting executive privilege over his testimony.</p>\n<p>Separately, the administration directed a former White House official not to comply with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee, prompting the panel to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/23/white-house-instructs-official-ignore-democratic-subpoena-over-security-clearances/?utm_term=.2c374c5ae98b&tid=lk_inline_manual_10\">move to hold him in contempt of Congress</a>. And the Treasury Department <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/treasury-likely-to-defy-tuesday-deadline-to-turn-over-trump-tax-returns/2019/04/23/daa7da46-653e-11e9-82ba-fcfeff232e8f_story.html?utm_term=.f4719ec4ce83&tid=lk_inline_manual_10\">defied</a> a second demand from House Democrats to turn over six years of President Trump&rsquo;s tax returns.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the moves mark a dramatic escalation of tensions between the president and congressional Democrats &mdash; deepening a fight that may ultimately be resolved only by a protracted court battle.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday the findings of the Mueller report, the investigations by congressional committees and the White House response had created a pivotal &ldquo;moment in our history.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now we see the administration engaging in stonewalling of the facts coming to the American people,&rdquo; Pelosi said in an interview for the Time 100 Summit in New York.</p>\n<p>White House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony, according to two officials familiar with internal plans who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>In his interview with The Post, Trump maintained that the White House Counsel&rsquo;s Office has not &ldquo;made a final, final decision&rdquo; about whether it will formally assert executive privilege and try to block congressional testimony. But he said he opposes cooperation with House Democrats, who he claimed are trying to score political points against him.</p>\n<p>The president said Democrats should be satisfied with what McGahn and other officials told Mueller, calling his decision to allow them to meet with federal investigators an act of transparency that made further congressional cooperation unreasonable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I allowed my lawyers and all the people to go and testify to Mueller &mdash; and you know how I feel about that whole group of people that did the Mueller report,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;I was so transparent; they testified for so many hours. They have all of that information that&rsquo;s been given.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I fully understood that at the beginning. I had my choice,&rdquo; Trump added of his decision to allow his aides to testify as part of Mueller&rsquo;s probe. &ldquo;I could have taken the absolute opposite route.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Legal experts said that a White House effort to assert executive privilege over possible testimony by McGahn and other former and current aides who spoke to the special counsel will face legal challenges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It seems to me executive privilege was waived when McGahn was permitted to give testimony and to be interviewed by special counsel Mueller,&rdquo; said former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the White House can assert executive privilege with something that has already been revealed. To use the Watergate expression, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t put the toothpaste back in the tube.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that the panel is specifically seeking McGahn&rsquo;s testimony related to subjects described in Mueller&rsquo;s report, which is now public in a redacted form.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As such, the moment for the White House to assert some privilege to prevent this testimony from being heard has long since passed,&rdquo; Nadler said in a statement.</p>\n<p>McGahn was mentioned more than 150 times in Mueller&rsquo;s report and told investigators about how the president pressured him to oust the special counsel and then pushed him to publicly deny the episode.</p>\n<p>Public testimony by McGahn could create a spectacle that would parallel the June 1973 testimony of President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s former White House counsel, John Dean, whose live, televised appearance before a Senate committee painted a vivid portrait for the country of the White House coverup of the Watergate burglary.</p>\n<p>McGahn&rsquo;s lawyer, William Burck, began discussions with the Judiciary Committee about his potential testimony after the panel issued a subpoena Monday, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>People close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is &ldquo;following the process&rdquo; and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump&rsquo;s public and private anger about his former counsel&rsquo;s prominence in the Mueller report.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not eager to testify. He&rsquo;s not reluctant. He got a subpoena. It compels him to testify. But there are some countervailing legal reasons that might prevent that,&rdquo; said one person close to McGahn, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t want to be in contempt of Congress, nor does he want to be in contempt of his ethical obligations and legal obligations as a former White House official.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/23/white-house-instructs-official-ignore-democratic-subpoena-over-security-clearances/?utm_term=.2c374c5ae98b&tid=lk_inline_manual_43\">moved </a>Tuesday to hold former White House personnel security director Carl Kline in contempt of Congress for failing to appear at a hearing investigating alleged lapses in White House security clearance procedures.</p>\n<p>The panel subpoenaed Kline following testimony from a White House whistleblower, Tricia Newbold, who alleged that the White House recklessly granted security clearances to individuals &mdash; including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner &mdash; over the objections of career staff members.</p>\n<p>Newbold, who processed security clearances under Kline at the White House for the first two years of the administration, told the panel that more than two dozen recommended denials for security clearances had been overturned during the Trump administration. She said that Congress was her &ldquo;last hope&rdquo; for addressing what she considered to be improper conduct that left the nation&rsquo;s secrets exposed.</p>\n<p>White House deputy counsel Michael M. Purpura wrote a letter Monday instructing Kline, who now works at the Defense Department, not to show up for a scheduled deposition before the committee Tuesday.</p>\n<p>In a letter to Kline&rsquo;s lawyer obtained by The Post, Purpura wrote that a committee subpoena asking Kline to appear &ldquo;unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>White House aides said the administration will seek to block Kline from giving any testimony and to prevent other administration officials from speaking to the panel about security clearances.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With two masters from two equal branches of government, we will follow the instructions of the one that employs him,&rdquo; Driscoll wrote.</p>\n<p>In response, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the Oversight Committee, said he would consult with the House counsel and members of the panel about scheduling a vote to hold Kline in contempt of Congress.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The White House and Mr. Kline now stand in open defiance of a duly authorized congressional subpoena with no assertion of any privilege of any kind by President Trump,&rdquo; Cummings said in a statement. &ldquo;Based on these actions, it appears that the President believes that the Constitution does not apply to his White House, that he may order officials at will to violate their legal obligations, and that he may obstruct attempts by Congress to conduct oversight.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Driscoll said that he and his client &ldquo;take seriously&rdquo; both the committee&rsquo;s concerns and the direction of the White House.</p>\n<p>House Democratic legal advisers have been poring over past congressional subpoena litigation as a guide as they map out a strategy to enforce a contempt citation without the backing of the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>A similar dynamic played out during the Obama administration, when then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. faced a subpoena and a contempt resolution from the House Oversight Committee, which was seeking information about a controversial gun-trafficking enforcement program called Operation Fast and Furious.</p>\n<p>A person close to Pelosi said she fully supports the efforts of her committee chairs to ensure House investigators secure the information lawmakers believe they need to hold the White House accountable.</p>\n<p>Efforts to block Congress have also extended to Trump&rsquo;s finances. On Monday, the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit to prevent an accounting firm from complying with a committee subpoena for eight years&rsquo; worth of Trump&rsquo;s financial records.</p>\n<p>And Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday told a key lawmaker he would make a final decision as to whether to furnish Trump&rsquo;s tax returns by May 6, committing for the first time to a specific deadline in what has become a major power struggle.</p>\n<p>In a 10-page letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), Mnuchin said the Democrats&rsquo; request for Trump&rsquo;s tax returns raised constitutional and privacy issues that needed to be resolved by the Justice Department before he could make a decision on how to proceed.</p>",

                "text": "President Trump on Tuesday said he is opposed to current and former White House aides providing testimony to congressional panels in the wake of the special counsel report, intensifying a power struggle between his administration and House Democrats.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Trump said that complying with congressional requests was unnecessary after the White House cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe of Russian interference and the president\u2019s own conduct in office.\n\u201cThere is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it\u2019s very partisan \u2014 obviously very partisan,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump\u2019s comments came as the White House made it clear that it plans to broadly defy requests for information from Capitol Hill, moving the two branches of government closer to a constitutional collision.\nOn Tuesday, two White House officials said the administration plans to fight a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee for former White House counsel Donald McGahn by asserting executive privilege over his testimony.\nSeparately, the administration directed a former White House official not to comply with a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee, prompting the panel to move to hold him in contempt of Congress. And the Treasury Department defied a second demand from House Democrats to turn over six years of President Trump\u2019s tax returns.\nTaken together, the moves mark a dramatic escalation of tensions between the president and congressional Democrats \u2014 deepening a fight that may ultimately be resolved only by a protracted court battle.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Tuesday the findings of the Mueller report, the investigations by congressional committees and the White House response had created a pivotal \u201cmoment in our history.\u201d\n\u201cNow we see the administration engaging in stonewalling of the facts coming to the American people,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview for the Time 100 Summit in New York.\nWhite House lawyers plan to tell attorneys for administration witnesses called by the House that they will be asserting executive privilege over their testimony, according to two officials familiar with internal plans who, like others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nIn his interview with The Post, Trump maintained that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office has not \u201cmade a final, final decision\u201d about whether it will formally assert executive privilege and try to block congressional testimony. But he said he opposes cooperation with House Democrats, who he claimed are trying to score political points against him.\nThe president said Democrats should be satisfied with what McGahn and other officials told Mueller, calling his decision to allow them to meet with federal investigators an act of transparency that made further congressional cooperation unreasonable.\n\u201cI allowed my lawyers and all the people to go and testify to Mueller \u2014 and you know how I feel about that whole group of people that did the Mueller report,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was so transparent; they testified for so many hours. They have all of that information that\u2019s been given.\u201d\n\u201cI fully understood that at the beginning. I had my choice,\u201d Trump added of his decision to allow his aides to testify as part of Mueller\u2019s probe. \u201cI could have taken the absolute opposite route.\u201d\nLegal experts said that a White House effort to assert executive privilege over possible testimony by McGahn and other former and current aides who spoke to the special counsel will face legal challenges.\n\u201cIt seems to me executive privilege was waived when McGahn was permitted to give testimony and to be interviewed by special counsel Mueller,\u201d said former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste. \u201cI don\u2019t see how the White House can assert executive privilege with something that has already been revealed. To use the Watergate expression, \u2018You can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube.\u2019\u201d\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Tuesday that the panel is specifically seeking McGahn\u2019s testimony related to subjects described in Mueller\u2019s report, which is now public in a redacted form.\n\u201cAs such, the moment for the White House to assert some privilege to prevent this testimony from being heard has long since passed,\u201d Nadler said in a statement.\nMcGahn was mentioned more than 150 times in Mueller\u2019s report and told investigators about how the president pressured him to oust the special counsel and then pushed him to publicly deny the episode.\nPublic testimony by McGahn could create a spectacle that would parallel the June 1973 testimony of President Richard Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel, John Dean, whose live, televised appearance before a Senate committee painted a vivid portrait for the country of the White House coverup of the Watergate burglary.\nMcGahn\u2019s lawyer, William Burck, began discussions with the Judiciary Committee about his potential testimony after the panel issued a subpoena Monday, according to people familiar with the matter.\nPeople close to McGahn, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said McGahn is \u201cfollowing the process\u201d and working with the White House on his next steps, despite Trump\u2019s public and private anger about his former counsel\u2019s prominence in the Mueller report.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not eager to testify. He\u2019s not reluctant. He got a subpoena. It compels him to testify. But there are some countervailing legal reasons that might prevent that,\u201d said one person close to McGahn, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be in contempt of Congress, nor does he want to be in contempt of his ethical obligations and legal obligations as a former White House official.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the House Oversight Committee moved Tuesday to hold former White House personnel security director Carl Kline in contempt of Congress for failing to appear at a hearing investigating alleged lapses in White House security clearance procedures.\nThe panel subpoenaed Kline following testimony from a White House whistleblower, Tricia Newbold, who alleged that the White House recklessly granted security clearances to individuals \u2014 including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 over the objections of career staff members.\nNewbold, who processed security clearances under Kline at the White House for the first two years of the administration, told the panel that more than two dozen recommended denials for security clearances had been overturned during the Trump administration. She said that Congress was her \u201clast hope\u201d for addressing what she considered to be improper conduct that left the nation\u2019s secrets exposed.\nWhite House deputy counsel Michael M. Purpura wrote a letter Monday instructing Kline, who now works at the Defense Department, not to show up for a scheduled deposition before the committee Tuesday.\nIn a letter to Kline\u2019s lawyer obtained by The Post, Purpura wrote that a committee subpoena asking Kline to appear \u201cunconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests.\u201d\nWhite House aides said the administration will seek to block Kline from giving any testimony and to prevent other administration officials from speaking to the panel about security clearances.\n\u201cWith two masters from two equal branches of government, we will follow the instructions of the one that employs him,\u201d Driscoll wrote.\nIn response, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), chairman of the Oversight Committee, said he would consult with the House counsel and members of the panel about scheduling a vote to hold Kline in contempt of Congress.\n\u201cThe White House and Mr. Kline now stand in open defiance of a duly authorized congressional subpoena with no assertion of any privilege of any kind by President Trump,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cBased on these actions, it appears that the President believes that the Constitution does not apply to his White House, that he may order officials at will to violate their legal obligations, and that he may obstruct attempts by Congress to conduct oversight.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Driscoll said that he and his client \u201ctake seriously\u201d both the committee\u2019s concerns and the direction of the White House.\nHouse Democratic legal advisers have been poring over past congressional subpoena litigation as a guide as they map out a strategy to enforce a contempt citation without the backing of the Justice Department.\nA similar dynamic played out during the Obama administration, when then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. faced a subpoena and a contempt resolution from the House Oversight Committee, which was seeking information about a controversial gun-trafficking enforcement program called Operation Fast and Furious.\nA person close to Pelosi said she fully supports the efforts of her committee chairs to ensure House investigators secure the information lawmakers believe they need to hold the White House accountable.\nEfforts to block Congress have also extended to Trump\u2019s finances. On Monday, the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit to prevent an accounting firm from complying with a committee subpoena for eight years\u2019 worth of Trump\u2019s financial records.\nAnd Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday told a key lawmaker he would make a final decision as to whether to furnish Trump\u2019s tax returns by May 6, committing for the first time to a specific deadline in what has become a major power struggle.\nIn a 10-page letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), Mnuchin said the Democrats\u2019 request for Trump\u2019s tax returns raised constitutional and privacy issues that needed to be resolved by the Justice Department before he could make a decision on how to proceed.",

                "html": "<p>The House on Tuesday passed a resolution to overturn President Trump&rsquo;s declaration of a national emergency on the southern border, as majority Democrats painted an apocalyptic portrait of a lawless chief executive out to gut the Constitution.</p>\n<p>The 245-to-182 tally was mostly along party lines, with 13 Republicans defecting to side with Democrats on a vote that effectively became a test of GOP loyalty to Trump. Despite their frequent complaints of executive overreach during the Obama administration, most Republicans fell in line with Trump&rsquo;s decision to try to circumvent Congress to get billions of dollars for his border wall. As a result, the vote fell well short of the two-thirds majority that would be required to overcome Trump&rsquo;s threatened veto.</p>\n<p>Democrats argued that Trump&rsquo;s claim of a crisis at the border was baseless and that he was embarking on the road to dictatorship by unilaterally declaring an emergency to try to get money from U.S. taxpayers to fulfill an unpopular campaign promise.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are not going to give any president, Democratic or Republican, a blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States,&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on the floor ahead of the vote. Holding up a pocket copy of the Constitution, she asked Republicans: &ldquo;Is your oath of office to Donald Trump or is your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Republicans countered that Democrats were ignoring a real crisis at the border and said that Trump was well within his rights to declare a national emergency, since he was acting under provisions of a law passed by Congress, the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Tuesday&rsquo;s vote was the first time since passage of the law that Congress has invoked provisions allowing for a resolution of disapproval to nullify a presidential emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a national emergency at the southern border that the Democrats will declare today doesn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). &ldquo;The president has the authority to do it, and we will uphold him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump issued the emergency declaration Feb. 15, as part of a deal to keep the government open after a 35-day partial shutdown over Christmas and much of January. The president agreed to sign a spending bill that keeps the government funded through Sept. 30 and provides $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing along the border in Texas, but he said he needed billions more. The administration plans to redirect an additional $6.7 billion from several sources, including $3.6 billion from military construction projects that can be accessed via the emergency declaration.</p>\n<p>Now that the House has passed the disapproval resolution, the Senate will have approximately 18 days to take it up, a timeline set by the National Emergencies Act. The law also specifies that passage in the Senate requires only a simple majority, not the 60-vote supermajority often required in that chamber.</p>\n<p>That means only four Republican votes in favor would ensure passage of the disapproval resolution &mdash; presuming that Democrats stick together as expected. Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) have said they plan to vote for the disapproval resolution, and other Republicans have been voicing concerns, including at a closed-door lunch Tuesday with Vice President Pence where about a half-dozen senators spoke up with reservations, according to one person in attendance.</p>\n<p>One of those senators was Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who questioned a Justice Department attorney present about how a future Democratic president might be able to use similar emergency powers, according to an official briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still reviewing the legal authorities and the arguments that the administration has put forward,&rdquo; Cruz said later.</p>\n<p>After attending the lunch with Pence, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he, too, was still evaluating the resolution, but he voiced deep concern about Trump&rsquo;s decision to declare an emergency.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good way to run government &mdash; to run government by emergency,&rdquo; Paul said. &ldquo;I think the Constitution&rsquo;s pretty clear that the power of the purse is with Congress, and I think the Supreme Court has been pretty clear in <i>Youngstown Steel</i> that executive orders that go against the will of Congress won&rsquo;t be upheld by the Court.&rdquo; He was referring to <i>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</i>, a 1952 case.</p>\n<p>A coalition of states has filed suit against the emergency declaration, as have some outside interest groups.</p>\n<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate would take up the disapproval resolution before the next congressional recess, which is scheduled to begin March 18.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I personally couldn&rsquo;t handicap the outcome at this point, but we will certainly be voting on it,&rdquo; McConnell said. He said Republican senators agree that there is a crisis at the southern border but that &ldquo;there are different points of view about how to address that, and all of that will be dealt with publicly on the floor before we have the vote.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senators said they had a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; discussion with Pence, during which the vice president focused on trying to explain the rationale for the emergency declaration and mollify concerns among rank-and-file Republicans that the reprogramming of funds could hurt their local military installations. The vice president made the case that the wall was the issue Trump ran on in his campaign and also argued that military construction projects would not be jeopardized, because that money could be replaced, according to the official briefed on the lunch.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you this, if it&rsquo;s military construction projects, we&rsquo;ll backfill that so fast, as soon as we get there,&rdquo; said Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, predicting &ldquo;no trouble&rdquo; in providing new funds for the projects. &ldquo;You can rest assured that issue won&rsquo;t stay alive long.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shelby dismissed any concerns about where money would be found to replenish the military accounts.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From money! Where do we fill everything else? Because it would be one of the highest priorities,&rdquo; Shelby said.</p>\n<p>A White House fact sheet Tuesday said the military construction funds would be tapped under the national emergency declaration only after the appropriated money and other funding sources had been exhausted, a sequencing that some Republicans pointed to as alleviating some of their concerns. The military construction funds would come from projects such as military housing and a variety of improvements at bases around the country and internationally, in situations where money has been appropriated by Congress but not yet committed in work contracts.</p>\n<p>Many Republicans who had argued against executive overreach when Obama was in office said Tuesday that the situation is different now, since Trump drew his authority to declare a national emergency from a federal law that also gives Congress the power to overturn his action.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be real honest, if Obama had done this, Republicans would be going nuts. That&rsquo;s just the reality,&rdquo; said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). &ldquo;Even if Obama had the authority to do it, just like I think President Trump does.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Simpson voted with the president and against the disapproval resolution, saying the National Emergencies Act gave Trump the authority to act as he did. Simpson did say the law itself should be revisited.</p>\n<p>The disapproval resolution consists of only one paragraph, which says the national emergency Trump declared &ldquo;is hereby terminated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The White House issued a formal veto threat Tuesday that read in part: &ldquo;The current situation at the Southern Border presents a humanitarian and security crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats dispute GOP claims of a border crisis, noting that border apprehensions are at some of their lowest levels in decades, and arguing that most of the drugs that cross into the United States from Mexico &mdash; an issue often raised by Trump and Republicans &mdash; come in via formal ports of entry as opposed to illegal crossings.</p>\n<p>During a hearing Tuesday morning at the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Gen. Terrence O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, who heads the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Command, dodged questions about whether he agreed with Trump that the situation at the southern border amountes to a national emergency.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Shaughnessy said he was following the instructions transmitted to him by executive order. He deferred to the Department of Homeland Security on the characterization of the situation, noting that the civilian migrants crossing the southern border do not constitute a military threat.</p>\n<p>Of the 13 House Republicans who opposed Trump, four are conservatives with strong libertarian leanings: Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Dusty Johnson (S.D.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (Wis.). The other nine are more-moderate Republicans, and some represent swing districts where Trump is not popular: Reps. Jamie Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Mike Gallagher (Wis.), Will Hurd (Tex.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Francis Rooney (Fla.), Greg Walden (Ore.), Fred Upton (Mich.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), a former member of House GOP leadership.</p>",

                "text": "The House on Tuesday passed a resolution to overturn President Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency on the southern border, as majority Democrats painted an apocalyptic portrait of a lawless chief executive out to gut the Constitution.\nThe 245-to-182 tally was mostly along party lines, with 13 Republicans defecting to side with Democrats on a vote that effectively became a test of GOP loyalty to Trump. Despite their frequent complaints of executive overreach during the Obama administration, most Republicans fell in line with Trump\u2019s decision to try to circumvent Congress to get billions of dollars for his border wall. As a result, the vote fell well short of the two-thirds majority that would be required to overcome Trump\u2019s threatened veto.\nDemocrats argued that Trump\u2019s claim of a crisis at the border was baseless and that he was embarking on the road to dictatorship by unilaterally declaring an emergency to try to get money from U.S. taxpayers to fulfill an unpopular campaign promise.\n\u201cWe are not going to give any president, Democratic or Republican, a blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on the floor ahead of the vote. Holding up a pocket copy of the Constitution, she asked Republicans: \u201cIs your oath of office to Donald Trump or is your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States?\u201d\nRepublicans countered that Democrats were ignoring a real crisis at the border and said that Trump was well within his rights to declare a national emergency, since he was acting under provisions of a law passed by Congress, the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Tuesday\u2019s vote was the first time since passage of the law that Congress has invoked provisions allowing for a resolution of disapproval to nullify a presidential emergency declaration.\n\u201cThere is a national emergency at the southern border that the Democrats will declare today doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). \u201cThe president has the authority to do it, and we will uphold him.\u201d\nTrump issued the emergency declaration Feb. 15, as part of a deal to keep the government open after a 35-day partial shutdown over Christmas and much of January. The president agreed to sign a spending bill that keeps the government funded through Sept. 30 and provides $1.375 billion for 55 miles of fencing along the border in Texas, but he said he needed billions more. The administration plans to redirect an additional $6.7 billion from several sources, including $3.6 billion from military construction projects that can be accessed via the emergency declaration.\nNow that the House has passed the disapproval resolution, the Senate will have approximately 18 days to take it up, a timeline set by the National Emergencies Act. The law also specifies that passage in the Senate requires only a simple majority, not the 60-vote supermajority often required in that chamber.\nThat means only four Republican votes in favor would ensure passage of the disapproval resolution \u2014 presuming that Democrats stick together as expected. Republican Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) have said they plan to vote for the disapproval resolution, and other Republicans have been voicing concerns, including at a closed-door lunch Tuesday with Vice President Pence where about a half-dozen senators spoke up with reservations, according to one person in attendance.\nOne of those senators was Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who questioned a Justice Department attorney present about how a future Democratic president might be able to use similar emergency powers, according to an official briefed on the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it.\n\u201cI\u2019m still reviewing the legal authorities and the arguments that the administration has put forward,\u201d Cruz said later.\nAfter attending the lunch with Pence, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he, too, was still evaluating the resolution, but he voiced deep concern about Trump\u2019s decision to declare an emergency.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good way to run government \u2014 to run government by emergency,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think the Constitution\u2019s pretty clear that the power of the purse is with Congress, and I think the Supreme Court has been pretty clear in Youngstown Steel that executive orders that go against the will of Congress won\u2019t be upheld by the Court.\u201d He was referring to Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, a 1952 case.\nA coalition of states has filed suit against the emergency declaration, as have some outside interest groups.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the Senate would take up the disapproval resolution before the next congressional recess, which is scheduled to begin March 18.\n\u201cI personally couldn\u2019t handicap the outcome at this point, but we will certainly be voting on it,\u201d McConnell said. He said Republican senators agree that there is a crisis at the southern border but that \u201cthere are different points of view about how to address that, and all of that will be dealt with publicly on the floor before we have the vote.\u201d\nSenators said they had a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with Pence, during which the vice president focused on trying to explain the rationale for the emergency declaration and mollify concerns among rank-and-file Republicans that the reprogramming of funds could hurt their local military installations. The vice president made the case that the wall was the issue Trump ran on in his campaign and also argued that military construction projects would not be jeopardized, because that money could be replaced, according to the official briefed on the lunch.\n\u201cLet me tell you this, if it\u2019s military construction projects, we\u2019ll backfill that so fast, as soon as we get there,\u201d said Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, predicting \u201cno trouble\u201d in providing new funds for the projects. \u201cYou can rest assured that issue won\u2019t stay alive long.\u201d\nShelby dismissed any concerns about where money would be found to replenish the military accounts.\n\u201cFrom money! Where do we fill everything else? Because it would be one of the highest priorities,\u201d Shelby said.\nA White House fact sheet Tuesday said the military construction funds would be tapped under the national emergency declaration only after the appropriated money and other funding sources had been exhausted, a sequencing that some Republicans pointed to as alleviating some of their concerns. The military construction funds would come from projects such as military housing and a variety of improvements at bases around the country and internationally, in situations where money has been appropriated by Congress but not yet committed in work contracts.\nMany Republicans who had argued against executive overreach when Obama was in office said Tuesday that the situation is different now, since Trump drew his authority to declare a national emergency from a federal law that also gives Congress the power to overturn his action.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be real honest, if Obama had done this, Republicans would be going nuts. That\u2019s just the reality,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho). \u201cEven if Obama had the authority to do it, just like I think President Trump does.\u201d\nNonetheless, Simpson voted with the president and against the disapproval resolution, saying the National Emergencies Act gave Trump the authority to act as he did. Simpson did say the law itself should be revisited.\nThe disapproval resolution consists of only one paragraph, which says the national emergency Trump declared \u201cis hereby terminated.\u201d\nThe White House issued a formal veto threat Tuesday that read in part: \u201cThe current situation at the Southern Border presents a humanitarian and security crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency.\u201d\nDemocrats dispute GOP claims of a border crisis, noting that border apprehensions are at some of their lowest levels in decades, and arguing that most of the drugs that cross into the United States from Mexico \u2014 an issue often raised by Trump and Republicans \u2014 come in via formal ports of entry as opposed to illegal crossings.\nDuring a hearing Tuesday morning at the Senate Armed Services Committee, Air Force Gen. Terrence O\u2019Shaughnessy, who heads the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Command, dodged questions about whether he agreed with Trump that the situation at the southern border amountes to a national emergency.\nO\u2019Shaughnessy said he was following the instructions transmitted to him by executive order. He deferred to the Department of Homeland Security on the characterization of the situation, noting that the civilian migrants crossing the southern border do not constitute a military threat.\nOf the 13 House Republicans who opposed Trump, four are conservatives with strong libertarian leanings: Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Dusty Johnson (S.D.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (Wis.). The other nine are more-moderate Republicans, and some represent swing districts where Trump is not popular: Reps. Jamie Herrera Beutler (Wash.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Mike Gallagher (Wis.), Will Hurd (Tex.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Francis Rooney (Fla.), Greg Walden (Ore.), Fred Upton (Mich.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.), a former member of House GOP leadership.",

The Justice Department said Tuesday afternoon that it does not intend to keep fighting the case.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion,&rdquo; said agency spokesman Jeremy Edwards. &ldquo;The Department has no plans to seek further review.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In its decision, a three-judge panel said the government failed to prove <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/19/what-justice-department-will-argue-get-its-att-appeal/?tid=lk_inline_manual_6\">its claims</a> that the lower court had misapplied &ldquo;fundamental principles of economics&rdquo; when assessing the deal&rsquo;s potential impact on consumers and AT&amp;T&rsquo;s rivals.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today&rsquo;s unanimous decision from the D.C. Circuit will end this litigation,&rdquo; AT&amp;T said in a statement.</p>\n<p>But while the decision could mean the end of the AT&amp;T-Time Warner battle, it probably will not settle a growing debate in Washington about the adequacy of America&rsquo;s antitrust laws and whether regulators have been too meek overall in challenging mergers.</p>\n<p>Critics of U.S. antitrust law say lax enforcement has led to ever more concentrated businesses, as well as an atrophied judicial understanding of the way companies can sometimes hurt competition even without affecting consumer prices.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The dominant economic philosophy of the last 25 or 30 years has been that the principal way to measure consumer harm is price,&rdquo; said Andrew Schwartzman, a lecturer in law at Georgetown University. &ldquo;And if that was ever correct, it&rsquo;s hopelessly obsolete in a digital environment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>According to the Justice Department&rsquo;s appeal, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ignored how AT&amp;T could use its control over Time Warner to raise its competitors&rsquo; costs. And, it said, AT&amp;T had an incentive to do so because company executives would naturally seek to use both their ownership of entertainment content and AT&amp;T&rsquo;s massive distribution network to maximize the company&rsquo;s overall profits.</p>\n<p>But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the lower court adequately considered those factors, and that offers by AT&amp;T to negotiate channel prices through arbitration with competing cable companies and TV providers would reduce the likelihood of harms to competition.</p>\n<p>In its initial case, the Justice Department had relied on a sophisticated economic model that claimed consumers could pay millions more per year for TV content if AT&amp;T tried to force its rivals to pay higher fees in exchange for its programming. AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/12/att-is-trying-to-undercut-the-governments-star-witness-in-the-blockbuster-time-warner-trial/?utm_term=.6fd37c825f45&tid=lk_inline_manual_19\">hired its own economist</a> to undercut the theory.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the evidence showed it is &ldquo;still in the best interests&rdquo; of AT&amp;T and Time Warner to sell its content to as many cable companies as possible, not seek to restrict access in exchange for higher payments, the appeals court said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a rich academic scholarship about the non-price harms from excessive concentration of ownership, but it has largely been ignored by the judiciary,&rdquo; Schwartzman said.</p>\n<p>That dynamic has been complicated by large tech companies such as Google and Facebook, many of which offer their services free at a massive scale. Antitrust regulators who feel pressured to focus on consumer prices risk making their own jobs more difficult when confronted with zero-cost online services, according to some analysts.</p>\n<p>Yet Delrahim has said the Justice Department is adequately equipped to analyze those industries, citing other businesses, such as the broadcast industry, that have historically provided their products to the public free.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our long history with zero-price strategies also tells us that we do not need a wholesale revision of the antitrust laws to address competitive concerns in these contexts,&rdquo; he said <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/assistant-attorney-general-makan-delrahim-delivers-keynote-address-silicon-flatirons\">in a recent speech</a>. &ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said before, our antitrust laws and principles are flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "A federal appeals court upheld AT&T\u2019s $85 billion merger with Time Warner on Tuesday, handing the telecom giant a major victory in its months-long legal battle against Justice Department regulators who had alleged the deal was anti-competitive.\nThe outcome is a significant defeat for the Justice Department\u2019s top antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, who legal analysts say took a big risk in suing AT&T and who has now lost twice at court. The Justice Department said Tuesday afternoon that it does not intend to keep fighting the case.\n\u201cWe are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections to the District Court opinion,\u201d said agency spokesman Jeremy Edwards. \u201cThe Department has no plans to seek further review.\u201d\nIn its decision, a three-judge panel said the government failed to prove its claims that the lower court had misapplied \u201cfundamental principles of economics\u201d when assessing the deal\u2019s potential impact on consumers and AT&T\u2019s rivals.\n\u201cWhile we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today\u2019s unanimous decision from the D.C. Circuit will end this litigation,\u201d AT&T said in a statement.\nBut while the decision could mean the end of the AT&T-Time Warner battle, it probably will not settle a growing debate in Washington about the adequacy of America\u2019s antitrust laws and whether regulators have been too meek overall in challenging mergers.\nCritics of U.S. antitrust law say lax enforcement has led to ever more concentrated businesses, as well as an atrophied judicial understanding of the way companies can sometimes hurt competition even without affecting consumer prices.\n\u201cThe dominant economic philosophy of the last 25 or 30 years has been that the principal way to measure consumer harm is price,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, a lecturer in law at Georgetown University. \u201cAnd if that was ever correct, it\u2019s hopelessly obsolete in a digital environment.\u201d\nAccording to the Justice Department\u2019s appeal, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ignored how AT&T could use its control over Time Warner to raise its competitors\u2019 costs. And, it said, AT&T had an incentive to do so because company executives would naturally seek to use both their ownership of entertainment content and AT&T\u2019s massive distribution network to maximize the company\u2019s overall profits.\nBut the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the lower court adequately considered those factors, and that offers by AT&T to negotiate channel prices through arbitration with competing cable companies and TV providers would reduce the likelihood of harms to competition.\nIn its initial case, the Justice Department had relied on a sophisticated economic model that claimed consumers could pay millions more per year for TV content if AT&T tried to force its rivals to pay higher fees in exchange for its programming. AT&T hired its own economist to undercut the theory.\nUltimately, the evidence showed it is \u201cstill in the best interests\u201d of AT&T and Time Warner to sell its content to as many cable companies as possible, not seek to restrict access in exchange for higher payments, the appeals court said Tuesday.\n\u201cThere is a rich academic scholarship about the non-price harms from excessive concentration of ownership, but it has largely been ignored by the judiciary,\u201d Schwartzman said.\nThat dynamic has been complicated by large tech companies such as Google and Facebook, many of which offer their services free at a massive scale. Antitrust regulators who feel pressured to focus on consumer prices risk making their own jobs more difficult when confronted with zero-cost online services, according to some analysts.\nYet Delrahim has said the Justice Department is adequately equipped to analyze those industries, citing other businesses, such as the broadcast industry, that have historically provided their products to the public free.\n\u201cOur long history with zero-price strategies also tells us that we do not need a wholesale revision of the antitrust laws to address competitive concerns in these contexts,\u201d he said in a recent speech. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, our antitrust laws and principles are flexible enough to adapt to the challenges of the digital economy.\u201d",

(Stephen Lam/Reuters)\" src=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6X4NQTSKNYI6TDH4FROQTGOCDY.jpg&w=150\"></img><figcaption>Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during a Google keynote address announcing a new video gaming streaming service named Stadia. (Stephen Lam/Reuters)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Google made a big leap into interactive entertainment on Tuesday as it announced an online video gaming platform that the company says represents the future of play.</p>\n<p>The streaming games service, called Stadia, allows users to run video games on sophisticated hardware maintained remotely by Google while directly controlling the action from their own devices over an Internet connection. Google&rsquo;s approach closely mirrors that of Netflix and on-demand video, a model that has since spread to e-books, music and live television. And it differs from existing platforms such as Valve&rsquo;s Steam, which require users to download and install a game before it can be played.</p>\n<p>At an industry conference in San Francisco, Google also debuted a console-style game controller designed to communicate with the new games service, which is built on top of the Google Chrome browser and runs from Google data centers located around the world.</p>\n<p>Both moves underscore the stakes for Google and other tech companies as they seek to stay dominant in a never-ending battle for consumers&rsquo; attention and behavioral data. Now the company is seeking to combine its advantages in software, networking and cloud computing to develop an entirely new product.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When we launched Chrome a decade ago, we imagined it could be a modern platform for Web applications,&rdquo; said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, &ldquo;including use cases that seemed impossible at that time, like high quality games.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Google faces other rising competitors in the space, including Microsoft&rsquo;s Project xCloud, a similar streaming service. News reports have also suggested that Apple, Amazon and Verizon may be mulling a push into cloud gaming of their own. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns the Washington Post.)</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, companies such as Epic Games, the publisher of &ldquo;Fortnite,&rdquo; have introduced their own game marketplaces and app launchers, which could compete with Google. And Sprint recently said it is <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/02/25/sprint-teams-up-with-hatch-entertainment-to-enable-5g-mobile-cloud-gaming/\">partnering</a> with the cloud gaming firm Hatch Entertainment as part of its launch of 5G wireless services. Proponents say 5G mobile data will be more reliable than 4G LTE, and will someday be able to support download speeds of 1,000 megabits per second &mdash; capabilities that could be ideal for cloud gaming.</p>\n<p>To help cement its place in the gaming industry, Google said Tuesday it is founding its own, proprietary game development studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment.</p>\n<p>The main Stadia service, which Google said will launch sometime this year, is also a recognition of YouTube&rsquo;s growing prominence as a destination for gamers, where many users produce videos of themselves playing games as countless viewers tune into their channels. Google&rsquo;s Stadia controller includes a dedicated button to share captured video game footage straight to YouTube, and the service will support simultaneous YouTube streaming of in-game activities, executives said.</p>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s emphasis on cloud gaming highlights the convergence of numerous trends &mdash; such as fast, low-latency broadband and the declining cost of computer processing, particularly at scale &mdash; that together could turn more people into gamers at all hours of the day, even if they lack the powerful computing tools needed to run the most advanced games.</p>\n<p>In a demonstration of Stadia, Google said players will be able to go from watching a game trailer on YouTube to clicking a button on the site to launch that game from Chrome &mdash; a process that should take as little as five seconds, according to Phil Harrison, a Google vice president and former console exec at Microsoft and Sony.</p>\n<p>Harrison repeatedly said the goal was to reduce or eliminate the &ldquo;friction&rdquo; that stands between players and their games, such as having to wait for downloads or access to more powerful equipment.</p>\n<p>Because games on Stadia operate from a Google server, said Harrison, players will be able to move from one Internet-connected device to another without interrupting their game session. The demo showed a Google employee, in the middle of a game of &ldquo;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Odyssey,&rdquo; switching from a Chromebook to a smartphone to a tablet, then to a PC and finally to a TV.</p>\n<p>The service is expected to display video at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, said Google, features that are quickly becoming table stakes in the rapidly evolving world of video games.</p>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s announcement represents the splashiest entry into cloud gaming yet, following a public beta last fall that allowed testers to try out &ldquo;Assassin&rsquo;s Creed: Odyssey&rdquo; from a Chrome browser.</p>\n<p>But some are skeptical that Google and other tech firms can build a sustainable business around cloud gaming. Most gamers who play premium games and who would likely be the target audience for such a service already have access to powerful gaming hardware, analysts say. And the move by Google into the distribution of games could lead to new tensions with game publishers, said Brandon Ross, an industry analyst at BTIG.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe third party publishers would be reluctant to empower distributors the way media companies empowered Netflix by allowing them to include front line product,&rdquo; Ross wrote in a recent research note.</p>\n<p>Stadia is expected to roll out first to the United States, Canada, the U.K. and parts of Europe, Harrison said.</p>",

                "text": "Google made a big leap into interactive entertainment on Tuesday as it announced an online video gaming platform that the company says represents the future of play.\nThe streaming games service, called Stadia, allows users to run video games on sophisticated hardware maintained remotely by Google while directly controlling the action from their own devices over an Internet connection. Google\u2019s approach closely mirrors that of Netflix and on-demand video, a model that has since spread to e-books, music and live television. And it differs from existing platforms such as Valve\u2019s Steam, which require users to download and install a game before it can be played.\nAt an industry conference in San Francisco, Google also debuted a console-style game controller designed to communicate with the new games service, which is built on top of the Google Chrome browser and runs from Google data centers located around the world.\nBoth moves underscore the stakes for Google and other tech companies as they seek to stay dominant in a never-ending battle for consumers\u2019 attention and behavioral data. Now the company is seeking to combine its advantages in software, networking and cloud computing to develop an entirely new product.\n\u201cWhen we launched Chrome a decade ago, we imagined it could be a modern platform for Web applications,\u201d said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, \u201cincluding use cases that seemed impossible at that time, like high quality games.\u201d\nBut Google faces other rising competitors in the space, including Microsoft\u2019s Project xCloud, a similar streaming service. News reports have also suggested that Apple, Amazon and Verizon may be mulling a push into cloud gaming of their own. (Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns the Washington Post.)\nMeanwhile, companies such as Epic Games, the publisher of \u201cFortnite,\u201d have introduced their own game marketplaces and app launchers, which could compete with Google. And Sprint recently said it is partnering with the cloud gaming firm Hatch Entertainment as part of its launch of 5G wireless services. Proponents say 5G mobile data will be more reliable than 4G LTE, and will someday be able to support download speeds of 1,000 megabits per second \u2014 capabilities that could be ideal for cloud gaming.\nTo help cement its place in the gaming industry, Google said Tuesday it is founding its own, proprietary game development studio, Stadia Games and Entertainment.\nThe main Stadia service, which Google said will launch sometime this year, is also a recognition of YouTube\u2019s growing prominence as a destination for gamers, where many users produce videos of themselves playing games as countless viewers tune into their channels. Google\u2019s Stadia controller includes a dedicated button to share captured video game footage straight to YouTube, and the service will support simultaneous YouTube streaming of in-game activities, executives said.\nGoogle\u2019s emphasis on cloud gaming highlights the convergence of numerous trends \u2014 such as fast, low-latency broadband and the declining cost of computer processing, particularly at scale \u2014 that together could turn more people into gamers at all hours of the day, even if they lack the powerful computing tools needed to run the most advanced games.\nIn a demonstration of Stadia, Google said players will be able to go from watching a game trailer on YouTube to clicking a button on the site to launch that game from Chrome \u2014 a process that should take as little as five seconds, according to Phil Harrison, a Google vice president and former console exec at Microsoft and Sony.\nHarrison repeatedly said the goal was to reduce or eliminate the \u201cfriction\u201d that stands between players and their games, such as having to wait for downloads or access to more powerful equipment.\nBecause games on Stadia operate from a Google server, said Harrison, players will be able to move from one Internet-connected device to another without interrupting their game session. The demo showed a Google employee, in the middle of a game of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey,\u201d switching from a Chromebook to a smartphone to a tablet, then to a PC and finally to a TV.\nThe service is expected to display video at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, said Google, features that are quickly becoming table stakes in the rapidly evolving world of video games.\nGoogle\u2019s announcement represents the splashiest entry into cloud gaming yet, following a public beta last fall that allowed testers to try out \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed: Odyssey\u201d from a Chrome browser.\nBut some are skeptical that Google and other tech firms can build a sustainable business around cloud gaming. Most gamers who play premium games and who would likely be the target audience for such a service already have access to powerful gaming hardware, analysts say. And the move by Google into the distribution of games could lead to new tensions with game publishers, said Brandon Ross, an industry analyst at BTIG.\n\u201cWe believe third party publishers would be reluctant to empower distributors the way media companies empowered Netflix by allowing them to include front line product,\u201d Ross wrote in a recent research note.\nStadia is expected to roll out first to the United States, Canada, the U.K. and parts of Europe, Harrison said.",

(Yves Herman/Reuters)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>European regulators fined Google about $1.7 billion Wednesday on charges that its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region&rsquo;s watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers.</p>\n<p>Margrethe Vestager, the European Union&rsquo;s top competition commissioner, said Google had engaged in &ldquo;illegal practices&rdquo; in a bid to &ldquo;cement its dominant market position&rdquo; in the search and advertising markets. She also said additional antitrust scrutiny of the tech giant was still to come.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-19-1770_en.htm\">new penalty</a> adds to Google&rsquo;s costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion citing antitrust violations. Her actions stand in stark contrast to the United States, where regulators &mdash; facing a flood of complaints that big tech companies have become <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/15/facebook-google-other-big-tech-giants-are-about-face-reckoning-state-attorneys-general-warn/?utm_term=.716bc38cf366&tid=lk_inline_manual_4\">too large and powerful</a> &mdash; have not brought an antitrust case against Google or any of its peers in recent years, reflecting a widening transatlantic schism over Silicon Valley and its business practices.</p>\n<p>Reacting to the fine, Kent Walker, Google&rsquo;s senior vice president of global affairs, stressed in a statement that the company already has made &ldquo;a wide range of changes to our products to address the [European] Commission&rsquo;s concerns.&rdquo; Google did not say whether it would appeal the E.U. decision.</p>\n<p>In 2018, Vestager <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/18/europe-penalizes-google-with-record-billion-antitrust-fine-way-it-bundles-its-apps-android-smartphones-tablets/?utm_term=.4c8753ea3b18&tid=lk_inline_manual_8\">took aim at the company&rsquo;s Android smartphone operating system</a>, saying Google pressured mobile device-makers to pre-install the tech giant&rsquo;s apps. A year before that, Vestager <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/eu-announces-record-27-billion-antitrust-fine-on-google-over-search-results/2017/06/27/1f7c475e-5b20-11e7-8e2f-ef443171f6bd_story.html?utm_term=.7a4280a3d960&tid=lk_inline_manual_8\">punished Google for giving its shopping-comparison service</a> a better placement in search results over rivals&rsquo; offerings. In both cases, Google has started tweaking its business practices in Europe to comply with the law while appealing the E.U. decisions in court.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s changes include a new effort, detailed Tuesday, to help owners of Android smartphones <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/supporting-choice-and-competition-europe/\">find and use competing search and Web-browsing services</a>. The update applies only to Europe, Google said in a blog post, without indicating whether it would alter any of its mobile practices in the United States. It still earned some early praise from Vestager, who said Wednesday that the company has the &ldquo;potential to give users a real choice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Vestager&rsquo;s latest punishment targets Google&rsquo;s relationships with third-party websites, from large retailers to small gossip blogs. Sites that participated in Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;AdSense for Search&rdquo; program could take advantage of Google&rsquo;s search tools on their Web pages, and users who searched those sites would see results alongside ads served up by Google.</p>\n<p>But Google for a time prohibited those third-party sites from using rival ad services, then required prominent placement of its own ads &mdash; two of the many restrictions on AdSense customers that led the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, to conclude in an initial complaint filed in 2016 that Google had acted in an anti-competitive way.</p>\n<p>E.U. officials acknowledged in 2016 that Google had changed its AdSense contracts to allow for &ldquo;more freedom to display competing search ads.&rdquo; But the decision announced Wednesday prohibits the company from introducing any such ad restrictions in the future, while opening the door for Google to face lawsuits from &ldquo;any person or business affected by its anti-competitive&rdquo; tactics, the E.U. said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts except to keep rivals out of the market,&rdquo; Vestager said at her news conference.</p>\n<p>The Google fine is the European Union&rsquo;s latest broadside against the tech industry. Vestager previously has acknowledged an ongoing antitrust investigation against Amazon, and earlier this month, she said the inquiry is in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/03/12/the-technology-202-eu-s-top-competition-cop-says-amazon-probe-in-quite-advanced-stage/5c86f5271b326b2d177d6057/?tid=lk_inline_manual_18\">&ldquo;quite advanced&rdquo; stage.</a> (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p>\n<p>Music-streaming site Spotify, meanwhile, has urged European regulators to take similar aim at Apple, alleging last week that the iPhone giant has an <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/13/uk-panel-calls-new-antitrust-regulator-targeting-giant-tech-platforms/?utm_term=.5f499f92a1a4&tid=lk_inline_manual_19\">&ldquo;unfair advantage&rdquo;</a> because of the subscription-related fees it charges certain app makers. Individual European countries &mdash; emboldened with tough online privacy laws that took effect last year &mdash; also have set their sights on Silicon Valley. A key regulatory agency in Ireland recently confirmed <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2019-02/DPC%20Annual%20Report%2025%20May%20-%2031%20December%202018.pdf\">it has opened 10 investigations</a> into Facebook and its data-collection practices.</p>\n<p>Google could face additional penalties in the European Union, where Vestager &mdash; who has emerged as one of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s toughest regulators &mdash; is set to finish her term as competition commissioner at the end of October. Regulators recently have started scrutinizing Google&rsquo;s handling of local search results, following a complaint brought by Yelp last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still looking into the search market for jobs and the search market for locals,&rdquo; Vestager said Wednesday. &ldquo;We keep getting complaints from people who are concerned about how these markets work.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "European regulators fined Google about $1.7 billion Wednesday on charges that its advertising practices violated antitrust laws, marking the third time in as many years that the region\u2019s watchdogs have penalized the U.S. tech giant for harming competition and consumers.\nMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s top competition commissioner, said Google had engaged in \u201cillegal practices\u201d in a bid to \u201ccement its dominant market position\u201d in the search and advertising markets. She also said additional antitrust scrutiny of the tech giant was still to come.\nThe new penalty adds to Google\u2019s costly headaches in Europe, where Vestager has fined the tech giant more than $9 billion citing antitrust violations. Her actions stand in stark contrast to the United States, where regulators \u2014 facing a flood of complaints that big tech companies have become too large and powerful \u2014 have not brought an antitrust case against Google or any of its peers in recent years, reflecting a widening transatlantic schism over Silicon Valley and its business practices.\nReacting to the fine, Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs, stressed in a statement that the company already has made \u201ca wide range of changes to our products to address the [European] Commission\u2019s concerns.\u201d Google did not say whether it would appeal the E.U. decision.\nIn 2018, Vestager took aim at the company\u2019s Android smartphone operating system, saying Google pressured mobile device-makers to pre-install the tech giant\u2019s apps. A year before that, Vestager punished Google for giving its shopping-comparison service a better placement in search results over rivals\u2019 offerings. In both cases, Google has started tweaking its business practices in Europe to comply with the law while appealing the E.U. decisions in court.\nThe company\u2019s changes include a new effort, detailed Tuesday, to help owners of Android smartphones find and use competing search and Web-browsing services. The update applies only to Europe, Google said in a blog post, without indicating whether it would alter any of its mobile practices in the United States. It still earned some early praise from Vestager, who said Wednesday that the company has the \u201cpotential to give users a real choice.\u201d\nVestager\u2019s latest punishment targets Google\u2019s relationships with third-party websites, from large retailers to small gossip blogs. Sites that participated in Google\u2019s \u201cAdSense for Search\u201d program could take advantage of Google\u2019s search tools on their Web pages, and users who searched those sites would see results alongside ads served up by Google.\nBut Google for a time prohibited those third-party sites from using rival ad services, then required prominent placement of its own ads \u2014 two of the many restrictions on AdSense customers that led the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, to conclude in an initial complaint filed in 2016 that Google had acted in an anti-competitive way.\nE.U. officials acknowledged in 2016 that Google had changed its AdSense contracts to allow for \u201cmore freedom to display competing search ads.\u201d But the decision announced Wednesday prohibits the company from introducing any such ad restrictions in the future, while opening the door for Google to face lawsuits from \u201cany person or business affected by its anti-competitive\u201d tactics, the E.U. said.\n\u201cThere was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts except to keep rivals out of the market,\u201d Vestager said at her news conference.\nThe Google fine is the European Union\u2019s latest broadside against the tech industry. Vestager previously has acknowledged an ongoing antitrust investigation against Amazon, and earlier this month, she said the inquiry is in a \u201cquite advanced\u201d stage. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\nMusic-streaming site Spotify, meanwhile, has urged European regulators to take similar aim at Apple, alleging last week that the iPhone giant has an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d because of the subscription-related fees it charges certain app makers. Individual European countries \u2014 emboldened with tough online privacy laws that took effect last year \u2014 also have set their sights on Silicon Valley. A key regulatory agency in Ireland recently confirmed it has opened 10 investigations into Facebook and its data-collection practices.\nGoogle could face additional penalties in the European Union, where Vestager \u2014 who has emerged as one of Silicon Valley\u2019s toughest regulators \u2014 is set to finish her term as competition commissioner at the end of October. Regulators recently have started scrutinizing Google\u2019s handling of local search results, following a complaint brought by Yelp last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still looking into the search market for jobs and the search market for locals,\u201d Vestager said Wednesday. \u201cWe keep getting complaints from people who are concerned about how these markets work.\u201d",

(Cole Burston/Bloomberg)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>President Trump on Tuesday met privately with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a huddle at the White House between one of the site&rsquo;s most prolific users and an executive who&rsquo;s faced criticism for the way Twitter has handled the president&rsquo;s tweets.</p>\n<p>The meeting came as Trump continues to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/19/trump-again-accuses-social-media-companies-censoring-conservatives/?utm_term=.bcea42cf36f0&tid=lk_inline_manual_3\">attack</a> the tech industry, threatening to regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter out of concern that they censor conservatives online &mdash; an allegation those companies fiercely deny. The president&rsquo;s latest salvo arrived just hours before he met with Dorsey: Trump accused<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1120651611410436098\"> Twitter</a> of playing &ldquo;political games&quot; and tampering with his nearly 60 million followers.</p>\n<p>A significant portion of the meeting focused on Trump&rsquo;s concerns that Twitter quietly, and deliberately, has limited or removed some of his followers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation who requested anonymity because it was private. Trump said he had heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well.</p>\n<p>But Twitter long has explained that follower figures fluctuate as the company takes action to remove fraudulent spam accounts. In the meeting, Dorsey stressed that point, noting even he had lost followers as part of Twitter&rsquo;s work to enforce its policies, according to the source, who described the meeting as cordial.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you for the time. Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil. Thanks for the discussion about that.</p>&mdash; jack (@jack) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1120825823647420416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>In a statement, Twitter said the meeting &mdash; initiated by the president &mdash; focused on &ldquo;protecting the health of the public conversation ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections and efforts underway to respond to the opioid crisis.&rdquo; Twitter partners with the federal government on a program to encourage Americans to dispose of prescription drugs they no longer need to prevent against abuse.</p>\n<p>In March, Trump accused Silicon Valley&rsquo;s largest companies of harboring a &ldquo;hatred&quot; for &quot;a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.&rdquo; In doing so, Trump threatened potential regulation, telling reporters at a press conference that the government may &ldquo;have to do something about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Previously, Trump joined a chorus of Republicans in claiming that Twitter secretly limits the reach of conservatives, a tactic known as &ldquo;shadow banning&rdquo; that Twitter has vehemently denied. And the president regularly has raised fears about changes in his follower count. Twitter&rsquo;s heightened crackdown against spam, however, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/07/13/heres-how-many-followers-trump-obama-others-lost-twitters-purge-locked-accounts/?utm_term=.3575769e0fe1&tid=lk_inline_manual_14\">long has affected both</a> liberals and conservatives on the site.</p>\n<p>In response, Twitter regularly has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/09/05/facebook-twitter-sandberg-dorsey-congress-tech-hearings/?utm_term=.2d3a12f27568&tid=lk_inline_manual_16\">stressed its political neutrality</a>. &ldquo;Impartiality is our guiding principle,&rdquo; Dorsey told lawmakers last year who grilled him over allegations that the site and its social-media peers exhibit bias against conservatives. Over the past year, Dorsey has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/15/jack-dorsey-says-hes-rethinking-core-how-twitter-works/?tid=lk_inline_manual_16\">sought to huddle with</a> high-profile right-leaning pundits and political figures, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/06/27/inside-facebook-twitters-secret-meetings-with-trump-aides-conservative-leaders-who-say-tech-is-biased/?tid=lk_inline_manual_16\">hoping to assuage their concerns about censorship</a>.</p>\n<p>Those gatherings sparked unrest among some of Twitter&rsquo;s employees, many of whom reside in liberal-leaning San Francisco. Ahead of Dorsey&rsquo;s visit to the White House, though, the Twitter executive stressed to workers his belief that &ldquo;conversation, not silence, bridges gaps and drives towards solutions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some of you will be very supportive of our meeting the president, and some of you might feel we shouldn&rsquo;t take this meeting at all,&rdquo; Dorsey said in an e-mail obtained by the Post. &ldquo;In the end, I believe it&rsquo;s important to meet heads of state in order to listen, share our principles and our ideas.&rdquo; The tech publication <a href=\"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evynxw/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-meeting-president-trump\">Motherboard</a> first obtained a copy of Dorsey&rsquo;s note.</p>\n<p>Dorsey long has faced pressure to curtail Trump&rsquo;s tweets, as critics contend that the president regularly violates the site&rsquo;s policies against harassment and abuse. Twitter has long maintained that it applies a different standard to prominent public figures, given that their comments &mdash; even offensive ones &mdash; remain in the public interest. But the company in March <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/28/twitter-still-wont-remove-trumps-tweets-that-violate-its-rules-it-will-label-them/?tid=lk_inline_manual_22\">said it soon would adopt a new approach</a>, labeling offensive tweets so users know why such content hasn&rsquo;t been removed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How can we put some context around it so people are aware that that content is actually a violation of our rules and it is serving a particular purpose in remaining on the platform,&quot; Vijaya Gadde, the company&rsquo;s head of legal, policy, and trust and safety, said at an event hosted by the Post.</p>",

                "text": "President Trump on Tuesday met privately with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, a huddle at the White House between one of the site\u2019s most prolific users and an executive who\u2019s faced criticism for the way Twitter has handled the president\u2019s tweets.\nThe meeting came as Trump continues to attack the tech industry, threatening to regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter out of concern that they censor conservatives online \u2014 an allegation those companies fiercely deny. The president\u2019s latest salvo arrived just hours before he met with Dorsey: Trump accused Twitter of playing \u201cpolitical games\" and tampering with his nearly 60 million followers.\nA significant portion of the meeting focused on Trump\u2019s concerns that Twitter quietly, and deliberately, has limited or removed some of his followers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation who requested anonymity because it was private. Trump said he had heard from fellow conservatives who had lost followers for unclear reasons as well.\nBut Twitter long has explained that follower figures fluctuate as the company takes action to remove fraudulent spam accounts. In the meeting, Dorsey stressed that point, noting even he had lost followers as part of Twitter\u2019s work to enforce its policies, according to the source, who described the meeting as cordial.\nThank you for the time. Twitter is here to serve the entire public conversation, and we intend to make it healthier and more civil. Thanks for the discussion about that.\n\u2014 jack (@jack) April 23, 2019\nIn a statement, Twitter said the meeting \u2014 initiated by the president \u2014 focused on \u201cprotecting the health of the public conversation ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections and efforts underway to respond to the opioid crisis.\u201d Twitter partners with the federal government on a program to encourage Americans to dispose of prescription drugs they no longer need to prevent against abuse.\nIn March, Trump accused Silicon Valley\u2019s largest companies of harboring a \u201chatred\" for \"a certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\u201d In doing so, Trump threatened potential regulation, telling reporters at a press conference that the government may \u201chave to do something about it.\u201d\nPreviously, Trump joined a chorus of Republicans in claiming that Twitter secretly limits the reach of conservatives, a tactic known as \u201cshadow banning\u201d that Twitter has vehemently denied. And the president regularly has raised fears about changes in his follower count. Twitter\u2019s heightened crackdown against spam, however, long has affected both liberals and conservatives on the site.\nIn response, Twitter regularly has stressed its political neutrality. \u201cImpartiality is our guiding principle,\u201d Dorsey told lawmakers last year who grilled him over allegations that the site and its social-media peers exhibit bias against conservatives. Over the past year, Dorsey has sought to huddle with high-profile right-leaning pundits and political figures, hoping to assuage their concerns about censorship.\nThose gatherings sparked unrest among some of Twitter\u2019s employees, many of whom reside in liberal-leaning San Francisco. Ahead of Dorsey\u2019s visit to the White House, though, the Twitter executive stressed to workers his belief that \u201cconversation, not silence, bridges gaps and drives towards solutions.\u201d\n\u201cSome of you will be very supportive of our meeting the president, and some of you might feel we shouldn\u2019t take this meeting at all,\u201d Dorsey said in an e-mail obtained by the Post. \u201cIn the end, I believe it\u2019s important to meet heads of state in order to listen, share our principles and our ideas.\u201d The tech publication Motherboard first obtained a copy of Dorsey\u2019s note.\nDorsey long has faced pressure to curtail Trump\u2019s tweets, as critics contend that the president regularly violates the site\u2019s policies against harassment and abuse. Twitter has long maintained that it applies a different standard to prominent public figures, given that their comments \u2014 even offensive ones \u2014 remain in the public interest. But the company in March said it soon would adopt a new approach, labeling offensive tweets so users know why such content hasn\u2019t been removed.\n\u201cHow can we put some context around it so people are aware that that content is actually a violation of our rules and it is serving a particular purpose in remaining on the platform,\" Vijaya Gadde, the company\u2019s head of legal, policy, and trust and safety, said at an event hosted by the Post.",

Trump&rsquo;s Democratic foes &mdash; and some Republican hawks &mdash; see dangerous signs of a president without much grasp of foreign policy who could be played by the North Koreans. Even Trump&rsquo;s own intelligence chief, Daniel Coats, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/intelligence-officials-will-name-biggest-threats-facing-us-during-senate-hearing/2019/01/28/f08dc5cc-2340-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html?utm_term=.91c05bd94576&tid=lk_inline_manual_14\">testified</a> last month that Kim isn&rsquo;t likely to give up his nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>But there are others, with deeper knowledge of North Korea than most, who say Trump&rsquo;s approach is the best game in town at the moment. They say his willingness to rip up the foreign policy rule book on a gut instinct might &mdash; just might &mdash; be an advantage.</p>\n<p>They include Robert Carlin, a visiting scholar at Stanford University who was involved in U.S.-North Korea talks from 1992 to 2000, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2xQ-U6tw_U\">Siegfried Hecker</a>, a leading nuclear scientist who visited North Korea&rsquo;s main Yongbyon nuclear complex in 2010.</p>\n<p>At Stanford, Hecker, Carlin and researcher Elliot Serbin have been charting the <a href=\"https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/content/cisac-north-korea\">degree of risk</a> on the Korean Peninsula since 1992, using indicators ranging from diplomacy to various aspects of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear and missile program.</p>\n<p>When Barack Obama took office, the boxes were a mixture of pinks and light reds. By the time he left office, eight out of 11 boxes were bright red, with North Korea testing missiles and bombs.</p>\n<p>Since then, though, the diplomacy box has shifted to green. With North Korea suspending nuclear and missile tests, other boxes have returned to a more reassuring mid-red or pink.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rapid North/South rapprochement and the Singapore Summit in 2018 dramatically lowered tensions and the threat of war on the Korean Peninsula,&rdquo; the trio says in a report, &ldquo;creating space and time to pursue diplomatic solutions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before leaving office, Obama told Trump that he had pushed his military to develop plans for a preemptive strike to destroy North Korea&rsquo;s missiles, Wit said, although those plans were never drawn up. Wit said his conclusions were drawn from 150 interviews with Trump and Obama administration officials over the past year as part of research for a book.</p>\n<p>Even Wit, who likes Trump&rsquo;s approach, says the president&rsquo;s iconoclastic style and resistance to criticism might also work against him. Combine those with a lack of attention to details, and &ldquo;that leaves him open to making big mistakes,&rdquo; Wit said in a breakfast meeting with a group of South Korean lawmakers and experts.</p>\n<p>After Trump landed in Hanoi aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, his motorcade passed thousands of onlookers, many recording the moment on their cellphones. People waved and some held flower bouquets or Vietnamese flags, featuring a gold star on a red background.</p>\n<p>Earlier, Kim arrived at the Dong Dang train station at Vietnam&rsquo;s border with China after a 65-hour, 2,500-mile train journey from Pyongyang. Kim, wearing a dark Mao-style suit, disembarked from his personal armored train at 8:22 a.m. under cold, drizzly skies.</p>\n<p>By now, Trump&rsquo;s negotiating strategy is becoming familiar, from NAFTA to the trade talks with China: Go in with guns blazing, dial up the rhetoric and then let officials quietly seek a reasonable compromise.</p>\n<p>The risk with North Korea, many experts say, is Trump&rsquo;s rush to make a deal when talks resume this week.</p>\n<p>He could end up granting Kim the diplomatic recognition and economic relief he craves without forcing him to surrender his weapons, allowing North Korea to take its place as a de facto nuclear power, critics fear. Trump may also undermine U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So funny to watch people who have failed for years, they got NOTHING, telling me how to negotiate with North Korea. But thanks anyway!&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1099722424059420673\">Trump tweeted</a> Monday before leaving for Hanoi.</p>\n<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been the strongest advocate of engagement with the North, struck a similar note.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even after overcoming difficulties to get this far, some people are still displeased with improvements in inter-Korean and North Korea-U. S. relations and are trying to drag them down,&rdquo; he said in a statement. &ldquo;I urge all of them to discard such biased perspectives, and let&rsquo;s do our best to seize the opportunity approaching us.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Democrats in the United States, it said, are trying to &ldquo;overtly and covertly disrupt the talks,&rdquo; using &ldquo;all sorts of groundless stories and misinformation,&rdquo; the KCNA wrote.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is absolutely as foolhardy as expecting to see a chicken turning into a phoenix to expect proper comment from the U.S. intelligence agencies,&rdquo; KCNA wrote, &ldquo;as they have it as their basic mission to claim white to be black, and lies to be truth, out of their skepticism toward others.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Hanoi this week, the broad outline of a possible deal has begun to take shape, involving a declaration to end the 1950-1953 Korean War, the opening of liaison offices in each country&rsquo;s capital, the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear complex and some marginal sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>But experts said it remains far from clear whether Trump and Kim will find enough common ground to get it over the line.</p>\n<p>The outreach with North Korea is &ldquo;clearly better off&rdquo; with Trump&rsquo;s top-down, summit-driven approach, said Joseph Yun, who served as the U.S. special representative for North Korea from October 2016 to March 2018, spanning Obama and Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no talk of war, so everyone is supportive of engagement of North Korea, political, diplomatic, economic engagement,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The question that remains: &lsquo;Has it made a big difference in nuclear weapons development?&rsquo; So far the answer is no,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;So this is the question that this summit has to answer.&rdquo;</p>",

They say his willingness to rip up the foreign policy rule book on a gut instinct might \u2014 just might \u2014 be an advantage.\nThey include Robert Carlin, a visiting scholar at Stanford University who was involved in U.S.-North Korea talks from 1992 to 2000, and Siegfried Hecker, a leading nuclear scientist who visited North Korea\u2019s main Yongbyon nuclear complex in 2010.\nAt Stanford, Hecker, Carlin and researcher Elliot Serbin have been charting the degree of risk on the Korean Peninsula since 1992, using indicators ranging from diplomacy to various aspects of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program.\nWhen Barack Obama took office, the boxes were a mixture of pinks and light reds. By the time he left office, eight out of 11 boxes were bright red, with North Korea testing missiles and bombs.\nSince then, though, the diplomacy box has shifted to green. With North Korea suspending nuclear and missile tests, other boxes have returned to a more reassuring mid-red or pink.\n\u201cRapid North/South rapprochement and the Singapore Summit in 2018 dramatically lowered tensions and the threat of war on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the trio says in a report, \u201ccreating space and time to pursue diplomatic solutions.\u201d\nBefore leaving office, Obama told Trump that he had pushed his military to develop plans for a preemptive strike to destroy North Korea\u2019s missiles, Wit said, although those plans were never drawn up. Wit said his conclusions were drawn from 150 interviews with Trump and Obama administration officials over the past year as part of research for a book.\nEven Wit, who likes Trump\u2019s approach, says the president\u2019s iconoclastic style and resistance to criticism might also work against him. Combine those with a lack of attention to details, and \u201cthat leaves him open to making big mistakes,\u201d Wit said in a breakfast meeting with a group of South Korean lawmakers and experts.\nAfter Trump landed in Hanoi aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, his motorcade passed thousands of onlookers, many recording the moment on their cellphones. People waved and some held flower bouquets or Vietnamese flags, featuring a gold star on a red background.\nEarlier, Kim arrived at the Dong Dang train station at Vietnam\u2019s border with China after a 65-hour, 2,500-mile train journey from Pyongyang. Kim, wearing a dark Mao-style suit, disembarked from his personal armored train at 8:22 a.m. under cold, drizzly skies.\nBy now, Trump\u2019s negotiating strategy is becoming familiar, from NAFTA to the trade talks with China: Go in with guns blazing, dial up the rhetoric and then let officials quietly seek a reasonable compromise.\nThe risk with North Korea, many experts say, is Trump\u2019s rush to make a deal when talks resume this week.\nHe could end up granting Kim the diplomatic recognition and economic relief he craves without forcing him to surrender his weapons, allowing North Korea to take its place as a de facto nuclear power, critics fear. Trump may also undermine U.S. alliances with Japan and South Korea.\n\u201cSo funny to watch people who have failed for years, they got NOTHING, telling me how to negotiate with North Korea. But thanks anyway!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday before leaving for Hanoi.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has been the strongest advocate of engagement with the North, struck a similar note.\n\u201cEven after overcoming difficulties to get this far, some people are still displeased with improvements in inter-Korean and North Korea-U. S. relations and are trying to drag them down,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI urge all of them to discard such biased perspectives, and let\u2019s do our best to seize the opportunity approaching us.\u201d\nDemocrats in the United States, it said, are trying to \u201covertly and covertly disrupt the talks,\u201d using \u201call sorts of groundless stories and misinformation,\u201d the KCNA wrote.\n\u201cIt is absolutely as foolhardy as expecting to see a chicken turning into a phoenix to expect proper comment from the U.S. intelligence agencies,\u201d KCNA wrote, \u201cas they have it as their basic mission to claim white to be black, and lies to be truth, out of their skepticism toward others.\u201d\nIn Hanoi this week, the broad outline of a possible deal has begun to take shape, involving a declaration to end the 1950-1953 Korean War, the opening of liaison offices in each country\u2019s capital, the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear complex and some marginal sanctions relief.\nBut experts said it remains far from clear whether Trump and Kim will find enough common ground to get it over the line.\nThe outreach with North Korea is \u201cclearly better off\u201d with Trump\u2019s top-down, summit-driven approach, said Joseph Yun, who served as the U.S. special representative for North Korea from October 2016 to March 2018, spanning Obama and Trump.\n\u201cThere is no talk of war, so everyone is supportive of engagement of North Korea, political, diplomatic, economic engagement,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe question that remains: \u2018Has it made a big difference in nuclear weapons development?\u2019 So far the answer is no,\u201d he added. \u201cSo this is the question that this summit has to answer.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka &mdash; The most horrific of days in recent Sri Lankan memory began with a prayer.</p>\n<p>It was Easter morning, and St. Anthony&rsquo;s Shrine &mdash; the largest Catholic congregation in a city where Christianity is a small but vibrant minority faith &mdash; was bursting with congregants, nearly 1,000 people in all. Men crowded in the back. Women and children squeezed into the pews. Father Joy Mariyaratnam, 52, asked everyone to stand to recite the Prayer of the Faithful, an entreaty to God to care for the community gathered there, the country and larger world.</p>\n<p>And a newly retraumatized country came into being &mdash; rattled by one of the worst terrorist attacks since Sept. 11, 2001, mournful of the deaths of 359 people and afraid of not only more possible strikes but also the potential for religious violence in a nation still haunted by a decades-long civil war and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/22/sri-lanka-is-all-too-familiar-with-suicide-bombing/?tid=lk_inline_manual_6\">a history of suicide bombs</a>.</p>\n<p>In all, there would be eight blasts, stretching the width of the country, but largely executed within a short time frame, striking three luxury hotels, three churches and two other locations. Several of the attacks took place in the capital city of Colombo.</p>\n<p>This is a glimpse into this thriving tropical city&rsquo;s first 72 hours after the violence, when people searched frantically for relatives, hospitals were deluged with the injured, and the grim accounting of the dead climbed ever higher.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;How could such a thing happen in a place of worship?&rdquo; asked Mariyaratnam. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just standing there, that&rsquo;s all, totally broken.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Delicia Fernando had a pretty good idea of how Sunday would go. The 52-year-old mother of three would attend Easter service at St. Anthony&rsquo;s Shrine, one of the nation&rsquo;s best-known churches and the spiritual center of the neighborhood. Then would come a small gathering at her parents&rsquo; house for lunch and visiting.</p>\n<p>Fernando&rsquo;s family arrived at the church for the 8 a.m. service, going through the arched entrances of the stately building, which has a history that traces to the 18th century and a large clock embedded in its whitewashed facade. She and her three children &mdash; two 20-something daughters and an 18-year-old son &mdash; found seats in the pews toward the front. Her husband, Ravi, a baker of 61 years who was always willing to help anyone in need, stood in the back of the sanctuary with the men who&rsquo;d given up seats to women and children.</p>\n<p>The Mass was well underway when everyone stood to pray.</p>\n<p>An explosion &mdash; described by witnesses as a fireball &mdash; then ripped off much of the roof, and all around on the ground were debris, people screaming in pain or shock, and the dead.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;God, please save us,&rdquo; was the first thing Fernando thought. Then she was pushing her children toward the front, telling them to run, go now.</p>\n<p>Her son turned to her: &ldquo;Where is my dad?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>They headed into the chaos of the sanctuary. That&rsquo;s where Fernando&rsquo;s son found her husband. He was buried under wooden beams, his body pierced with shrapnel. The family cleared off the debris, picked him up and carried him out to the ambulances that began to arrive outside. But it was already too late. His body had gone cold.</p>\n<p>Fernando returned to her parents&rsquo; house, where the family wasn&rsquo;t sharing a meal like she&rsquo;d once expected &mdash; but instead expressing grief with a line of mourners. Throughout the narrow, brightly colored lanes behind St. Anthony&rsquo;s, similar scenes were playing out.</p>\n<p>Inside the Fernando home, the husband&rsquo;s younger sister, Jeyarani Fernando, 55, tried to comprehend the incomprehensible. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why God has taken him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nearby, Fernando sat in a plastic chair. Her eyes were filling with tears. She didn&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My husband is gone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now there is no one to help me and the children.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Nearly three miles away, toward the heart of the city, a nurse named Mangala Gunesekara was working the morning shift when she recognized something dreadful had happened. In Colombo, victims were pouring into the emergency room of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in all states of physical and psychological trauma. Fractured limbs. Penetrating wounds. Extensive burns. Faraway stares.</p>\n<p>Gunesekara, 29, had only been a nurse for two years and had never seen anything like this. But she immediately got to work, trying to stop the bleeding and rushing people into surgery. Sometimes the doctors were successful. Other times, they weren&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>Two days later, Gunesekara was shaking her head. She couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about what she&rsquo;d seen. She recalled the two pregnant women who&rsquo;d arrived from St. Anthony&rsquo;s church, unharmed but emotionally shattered. What will become of them? &ldquo;We push on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But our heads are in a different place. I keep returning to those scenes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of her patients was a 39-year-old woman named Dananjali Weerasekera, lying on a narrow wrought-iron bed with a piece of shrapnel still lodged in her chest. The music of the ward was the whir of electric fans, medical monitors beeping and striped curtains opening and closing.</p>\n<p>She&rsquo;d worked most of her adult life at the Cinnamon Grand hotel, one of the three luxury hotels bombed on Sunday. She started out small 18 years ago but had since risen to become a supervisor of the posh Taprobane restaurant, which served a sweeping breakfast spread every morning.</p>\n<p>The morning of the attacks &mdash; a comparatively quiet one, with only about 20 diners &mdash; it had been her job to make sure that everything in the buffet was well-stocked and to make guests feel welcome. Some had requested coconut water with their breakfast, so Weerasekera was walking to grab a few straws when she heard the blast and was knocked to the ground. The restaurant that she&rsquo;d worked years to supervise was now a &ldquo;total disaster.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rising from the floor, she soon realized she couldn&rsquo;t breathe. Pressure was rising in her chest. Colleagues asked her if she was okay. Then she was in a taxi heading to the hospital, where doctors discovered a small, jagged shrapnel wound above her left breast, and where she still was still being treated Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Her boss had only been a few yards from her &mdash; &ldquo;very close,&rdquo; she recalled &mdash; but he had died, while she had not. Three other staff members, too, had died, but not her.</p>\n<p>She leaned back in her bed while the nurses worked and the electric fans hummed.</p>",

                "text": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 The most horrific of days in recent Sri Lankan memory began with a prayer.\nIt was Easter morning, and St. Anthony\u2019s Shrine \u2014 the largest Catholic congregation in a city where Christianity is a small but vibrant minority faith \u2014 was bursting with congregants, nearly 1,000 people in all. Men crowded in the back. Women and children squeezed into the pews. Father Joy Mariyaratnam, 52, asked everyone to stand to recite the Prayer of the Faithful, an entreaty to God to care for the community gathered there, the country and larger world.\nAnd a newly retraumatized country came into being \u2014 rattled by one of the worst terrorist attacks since Sept. 11, 2001, mournful of the deaths of 359 people and afraid of not only more possible strikes but also the potential for religious violence in a nation still haunted by a decades-long civil war and a history of suicide bombs.\nIn all, there would be eight blasts, stretching the width of the country, but largely executed within a short time frame, striking three luxury hotels, three churches and two other locations. Several of the attacks took place in the capital city of Colombo.\nThis is a glimpse into this thriving tropical city\u2019s first 72 hours after the violence, when people searched frantically for relatives, hospitals were deluged with the injured, and the grim accounting of the dead climbed ever higher.\n\u201cHow could such a thing happen in a place of worship?\u201d asked Mariyaratnam. \u201cYou\u2019re just standing there, that\u2019s all, totally broken.\u201d\nDelicia Fernando had a pretty good idea of how Sunday would go. The 52-year-old mother of three would attend Easter service at St. Anthony\u2019s Shrine, one of the nation\u2019s best-known churches and the spiritual center of the neighborhood. Then would come a small gathering at her parents\u2019 house for lunch and visiting.\nFernando\u2019s family arrived at the church for the 8 a.m. service, going through the arched entrances of the stately building, which has a history that traces to the 18th century and a large clock embedded in its whitewashed facade. She and her three children \u2014 two 20-something daughters and an 18-year-old son \u2014 found seats in the pews toward the front. Her husband, Ravi, a baker of 61 years who was always willing to help anyone in need, stood in the back of the sanctuary with the men who\u2019d given up seats to women and children.\nThe Mass was well underway when everyone stood to pray.\nAn explosion \u2014 described by witnesses as a fireball \u2014 then ripped off much of the roof, and all around on the ground were debris, people screaming in pain or shock, and the dead.\n\u201cGod, please save us,\u201d was the first thing Fernando thought. Then she was pushing her children toward the front, telling them to run, go now.\nHer son turned to her: \u201cWhere is my dad?\u201d\nThey headed into the chaos of the sanctuary. That\u2019s where Fernando\u2019s son found her husband. He was buried under wooden beams, his body pierced with shrapnel. The family cleared off the debris, picked him up and carried him out to the ambulances that began to arrive outside. But it was already too late. His body had gone cold.\nFernando returned to her parents\u2019 house, where the family wasn\u2019t sharing a meal like she\u2019d once expected \u2014 but instead expressing grief with a line of mourners. Throughout the narrow, brightly colored lanes behind St. Anthony\u2019s, similar scenes were playing out.\nInside the Fernando home, the husband\u2019s younger sister, Jeyarani Fernando, 55, tried to comprehend the incomprehensible. \u201cI don\u2019t know why God has taken him.\u201d\nNearby, Fernando sat in a plastic chair. Her eyes were filling with tears. She didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\u201cMy husband is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cNow there is no one to help me and the children.\u201d\nNearly three miles away, toward the heart of the city, a nurse named Mangala Gunesekara was working the morning shift when she recognized something dreadful had happened. In Colombo, victims were pouring into the emergency room of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in all states of physical and psychological trauma. Fractured limbs. Penetrating wounds. Extensive burns. Faraway stares.\nGunesekara, 29, had only been a nurse for two years and had never seen anything like this. But she immediately got to work, trying to stop the bleeding and rushing people into surgery. Sometimes the doctors were successful. Other times, they weren\u2019t.\nTwo days later, Gunesekara was shaking her head. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what she\u2019d seen. She recalled the two pregnant women who\u2019d arrived from St. Anthony\u2019s church, unharmed but emotionally shattered. What will become of them? \u201cWe push on,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our heads are in a different place. I keep returning to those scenes.\u201d\nOne of her patients was a 39-year-old woman named Dananjali Weerasekera, lying on a narrow wrought-iron bed with a piece of shrapnel still lodged in her chest. The music of the ward was the whir of electric fans, medical monitors beeping and striped curtains opening and closing.\nShe\u2019d worked most of her adult life at the Cinnamon Grand hotel, one of the three luxury hotels bombed on Sunday. She started out small 18 years ago but had since risen to become a supervisor of the posh Taprobane restaurant, which served a sweeping breakfast spread every morning.\nThe morning of the attacks \u2014 a comparatively quiet one, with only about 20 diners \u2014 it had been her job to make sure that everything in the buffet was well-stocked and to make guests feel welcome. Some had requested coconut water with their breakfast, so Weerasekera was walking to grab a few straws when she heard the blast and was knocked to the ground. The restaurant that she\u2019d worked years to supervise was now a \u201ctotal disaster.\u201d\nRising from the floor, she soon realized she couldn\u2019t breathe. Pressure was rising in her chest. Colleagues asked her if she was okay. Then she was in a taxi heading to the hospital, where doctors discovered a small, jagged shrapnel wound above her left breast, and where she still was still being treated Tuesday.\nHer boss had only been a few yards from her \u2014 \u201cvery close,\u201d she recalled \u2014 but he had died, while she had not. Three other staff members, too, had died, but not her.\nShe leaned back in her bed while the nurses worked and the electric fans hummed.",

(David Crosling/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>SYDNEY &mdash; A judge began the sentencing hearing Wednesday for Australian Cardinal George Pell for sexual assault even as details of the case spill out more than two months after he was convicted of abusing two choirboys 22 years ago.</p>\n<p>The trial of the 77-year-old Pell again brought the Vatican&rsquo;s abuse scandals into the highest levels of the church hierarchy. The verdict was made public just days after a Vatican summit on sexual abuse in the church.</p>\n<p>But the Pell case, which unfolded in a Melbourne courtroom, also was a test of whether court privacy rules are still enforceable &mdash; or applicable &mdash; with borderless news sites and social media.</p>\n<p>At a hearing Wednesday, Victoria state County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd said that the fallen priest&rsquo;s sentence would need to deter others from committing similar crimes but also that his prospects for rehabilitation are good and he is unlikely to commit more crimes, the Age newspaper reported. A prosecutor, Mark Gibson, told Kidd that Pell should receive jail time.</p>\n<p>The announcement Tuesday of Pell&rsquo;s conviction in December came after a media gag order was lifted by prosecutors, who dropped separate sexual assault charges against Pell. As a result, Pell will not face another trial.</p>\n<p>That allowed Australian media to officially report Pell&rsquo;s conviction. Still, it was something of an exercise in repackaging old news.</p>\n<p>It was clear to anyone following the case that Pell had been found guilty late last year. Some media outlets outside Australia, including The Washington Post, reported the conviction &mdash; and that found its way onto Australian websites and social networks.</p>\n<p>The front page of the Dec. 13 Herald Sun newspaper in Melbourne had a single word in huge white type against a black background: Censored.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,&rdquo; read the subhead, referring to Australia&rsquo;s Victoria state. &ldquo;The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It&rsquo;s a story you deserve to read.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pell was mobbed by reporters as he left the courtroom Tuesday. He made no comment, but his lawyer said he planned to appeal. Sentencing hearings were scheduled to begin Wednesday.</p>\n<p>A child-abuse survivor &mdash; identified as &ldquo;Michael Advocate&rdquo; because his real name is suppressed under Australian law &mdash; shouted to Pell, &ldquo;Burn in hell,&rdquo; the Reuters news agency reported.</p>\n<p>The conviction of Pell stems from incidents against two boys, then both 13 years old, in December 1996 and February 1997, according to prosecutors, after Pell had conducted Sunday Mass at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>The Vatican said Tuesday that the news was &ldquo;painful.&rdquo; It said Pell has been under &ldquo;precautionary&rdquo; orders to refrain from contact with minors and cannot exercise public ministry. Those measures will remain in place, the Vatican said, while it awaits a &ldquo;definitive assessment of the facts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a separate statement, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said Pell&rsquo;s conviction has &ldquo;shocked many across Australia and around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the United States, Australian-style gag orders imposed by judges would meet immediate challenges as censorship and a violation of the First Amendment. Some general limitations, such as not reporting the names of minors in abuse cases, are often followed.</p>\n<p>In some cases, lawmakers have argued that forcing courts to make trials accessible to the public would prevent security agencies from providing classified evidence considered necessary to convict terrorism suspects, for instance. This has led to some trials being fully closed to the public.</p>\n<p>More common are suppression orders restricting coverage on certain details or for a certain amount of time.</p>\n<p>Australia and Britain are among only a few countries where judges also are able to suppress reporting by issuing gag orders. Those who breach suppression orders in Australia can face serious punishments.</p>\n<p>But as more readers consume news online, gag orders have become far less effective, as international media outlets may be able to circumvent the restrictions. Critics also argue that rumors about trials, including misinformation, can spread on social media within seconds.</p>\n<p>A British committee of judges ruled in 2011 that gag orders were used too frequently. In their complaints, critics previously had also argued that the public was largely unaware of the extent to which gag orders restricted the work of reporters and human rights advocates, as reporting the existence of such orders was often illegal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A degree of secrecy is often necessary to do justice, but where secrecy is ordered, it should only be to the extent strictly necessary to achieve the interests of justice,&rdquo; committee director David Neuberger argued at the time.</p>\n<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged foreign media outlets last year to respect a suppression order on a person accused in a British backpacker&rsquo;s killing, after tabloids in Britain revealed the accused&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anything to jeopardize the case that the police are pursuing,&rdquo; Ardern said in December, the same week Pell was convicted in Australia.</p>\n<p>Later Tuesday, a Vatican spokesman said on Twitter that Pell no longer held his role as economy minister, widely considered the Vatican&rsquo;s third most powerful position. It was unclear when that change happened, and the spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the charges were first announced in 2017, Pell took a leave of absence from that role. Last year, Pope Francis dropped Pell from his de facto cabinet, known as the C-9.</p>\n<p>In the 1996 incident, the Age newspaper reported, Pell caught the two boys drinking sacramental wine in a changing room. He told the boys they were in trouble, exposed himself, pushed one of the boys close to his penis and then placed his penis in the other boy&rsquo;s mouth, the court was told.</p>\n<p>In the second incident, in 1997, one of the victims testified that Pell had pushed him against a wall in a hallway of the cathedral and squeezed his genitals. He reported the incident to police in 2015. The other boy died several years ago, the Age reported.</p>\n<p>Last week, Francis convened a Vatican summit on tackling clerical abuse to demonstrate the church&rsquo;s determination to act against abusive priests across the world. While the gathering was unprecedented, it led to no specific new measures, though the church says it will now work to strengthen guidelines across the world aimed at punishing both abusers and any higher-ups who fail to report abusive behavior.</p>\n<p>Also this month, the Vatican defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who once led the archdiocese of Washington, for sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, one of Pell&rsquo;s attorneys, Paul Galbally, said the priest continued to maintain his innocence and has lodged an appeal.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Although originally the cardinal faced allegations from a number of complainants, all charges except for those the subject of the appeal have now been either withdrawn, discharged or discontinued,&rdquo; Galbally said outside the Melbourne courthouse. &ldquo;He will not be commenting in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "SYDNEY \u2014 A judge began the sentencing hearing Wednesday for Australian Cardinal George Pell for sexual assault even as details of the case spill out more than two months after he was convicted of abusing two choirboys 22 years ago.\nThe trial of the 77-year-old Pell again brought the Vatican\u2019s abuse scandals into the highest levels of the church hierarchy. The verdict was made public just days after a Vatican summit on sexual abuse in the church.\nBut the Pell case, which unfolded in a Melbourne courtroom, also was a test of whether court privacy rules are still enforceable \u2014 or applicable \u2014 with borderless news sites and social media.\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Victoria state County Court Chief Judge Peter Kidd said that the fallen priest\u2019s sentence would need to deter others from committing similar crimes but also that his prospects for rehabilitation are good and he is unlikely to commit more crimes, the Age newspaper reported. A prosecutor, Mark Gibson, told Kidd that Pell should receive jail time.\nThe announcement Tuesday of Pell\u2019s conviction in December came after a media gag order was lifted by prosecutors, who dropped separate sexual assault charges against Pell. As a result, Pell will not face another trial.\nThat allowed Australian media to officially report Pell\u2019s conviction. Still, it was something of an exercise in repackaging old news.\nIt was clear to anyone following the case that Pell had been found guilty late last year. Some media outlets outside Australia, including The Washington Post, reported the conviction \u2014 and that found its way onto Australian websites and social networks.\nThe front page of the Dec. 13 Herald Sun newspaper in Melbourne had a single word in huge white type against a black background: Censored.\n\u201cThe world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,\u201d read the subhead, referring to Australia\u2019s Victoria state. \u201cThe Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It\u2019s a story you deserve to read.\u201d\nPell was mobbed by reporters as he left the courtroom Tuesday. He made no comment, but his lawyer said he planned to appeal. Sentencing hearings were scheduled to begin Wednesday.\nA child-abuse survivor \u2014 identified as \u201cMichael Advocate\u201d because his real name is suppressed under Australian law \u2014 shouted to Pell, \u201cBurn in hell,\u201d the Reuters news agency reported.\nThe conviction of Pell stems from incidents against two boys, then both 13 years old, in December 1996 and February 1997, according to prosecutors, after Pell had conducted Sunday Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne.\nThe Vatican said Tuesday that the news was \u201cpainful.\u201d It said Pell has been under \u201cprecautionary\u201d orders to refrain from contact with minors and cannot exercise public ministry. Those measures will remain in place, the Vatican said, while it awaits a \u201cdefinitive assessment of the facts.\u201d\nIn a separate statement, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said Pell\u2019s conviction has \u201cshocked many across Australia and around the world.\u201d\nIn the United States, Australian-style gag orders imposed by judges would meet immediate challenges as censorship and a violation of the First Amendment. Some general limitations, such as not reporting the names of minors in abuse cases, are often followed.\nIn some cases, lawmakers have argued that forcing courts to make trials accessible to the public would prevent security agencies from providing classified evidence considered necessary to convict terrorism suspects, for instance. This has led to some trials being fully closed to the public.\nMore common are suppression orders restricting coverage on certain details or for a certain amount of time.\nAustralia and Britain are among only a few countries where judges also are able to suppress reporting by issuing gag orders. Those who breach suppression orders in Australia can face serious punishments.\nBut as more readers consume news online, gag orders have become far less effective, as international media outlets may be able to circumvent the restrictions. Critics also argue that rumors about trials, including misinformation, can spread on social media within seconds.\nA British committee of judges ruled in 2011 that gag orders were used too frequently. In their complaints, critics previously had also argued that the public was largely unaware of the extent to which gag orders restricted the work of reporters and human rights advocates, as reporting the existence of such orders was often illegal.\n\u201cA degree of secrecy is often necessary to do justice, but where secrecy is ordered, it should only be to the extent strictly necessary to achieve the interests of justice,\u201d committee director David Neuberger argued at the time.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged foreign media outlets last year to respect a suppression order on a person accused in a British backpacker\u2019s killing, after tabloids in Britain revealed the accused\u2019s name.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want anything to jeopardize the case that the police are pursuing,\u201d Ardern said in December, the same week Pell was convicted in Australia.\nLater Tuesday, a Vatican spokesman said on Twitter that Pell no longer held his role as economy minister, widely considered the Vatican\u2019s third most powerful position. It was unclear when that change happened, and the spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. When the charges were first announced in 2017, Pell took a leave of absence from that role. Last year, Pope Francis dropped Pell from his de facto cabinet, known as the C-9.\nIn the 1996 incident, the Age newspaper reported, Pell caught the two boys drinking sacramental wine in a changing room. He told the boys they were in trouble, exposed himself, pushed one of the boys close to his penis and then placed his penis in the other boy\u2019s mouth, the court was told.\nIn the second incident, in 1997, one of the victims testified that Pell had pushed him against a wall in a hallway of the cathedral and squeezed his genitals. He reported the incident to police in 2015. The other boy died several years ago, the Age reported.\nLast week, Francis convened a Vatican summit on tackling clerical abuse to demonstrate the church\u2019s determination to act against abusive priests across the world. While the gathering was unprecedented, it led to no specific new measures, though the church says it will now work to strengthen guidelines across the world aimed at punishing both abusers and any higher-ups who fail to report abusive behavior.\nAlso this month, the Vatican defrocked former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who once led the archdiocese of Washington, for sexual abuse.\nOn Tuesday, one of Pell\u2019s attorneys, Paul Galbally, said the priest continued to maintain his innocence and has lodged an appeal.\n\u201cAlthough originally the cardinal faced allegations from a number of complainants, all charges except for those the subject of the appeal have now been either withdrawn, discharged or discontinued,\u201d Galbally said outside the Melbourne courthouse. \u201cHe will not be commenting in the meantime.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>Michael Cohen, President Trump&rsquo;s former personal lawyer, is <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cohen-plans-scathing-testimony-about-trump-russia-and-stormy-daniels/2019/02/25/9024e1ec-394e-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html?utm_term=.c68d8bafe969&tid=lk_inline_manual_1\">scheduled to testify </a>before three congressional committees this week &mdash; two in private and one in a potentially explosive public hearing.</p>\n<p>Cohen once proudly considered himself Trump&rsquo;s fixer, and there are few people closer to the president than he once was. He is expected to describe to lawmakers what he views as Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;lies, racism and cheating,&rdquo; both as president and in private business, and will describe &ldquo;personal, behind-the-scenes&rdquo; interactions he witnessed, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>\n<p>Cohen pleaded guilty last year to multiple crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump, and lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. He is supposed to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May.</p>\n<p>He will testify Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee and Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/26/michael-cohens-days-capitol-hill-testimony-explained/?utm_term=.67a1d973ae6a&tid=lk_inline_manual_6\">though only the oversight hearing is public</a>.</p>\n<p>In a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Cohen a &ldquo;disgraced felon,&rdquo; noting his past lies to lawmakers. &ldquo;Sadly,&rdquo; the statement says, &ldquo;he will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It&rsquo;s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In his testimony, Cohen is expected to detail his motives for having helped Trump and for now coming clean, the person familiar with the matter said. He will offer &ldquo;very specific details&rdquo; &mdash; some of which have not yet been made public &mdash; about arranging the hush-money payments at Trump&rsquo;s direction, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the expected testimony.</p>\n<p>Cohen also is expected to &ldquo;provide more detail about his lies to Congress&rdquo; and address in some capacity a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation\">BuzzFeed News report</a> asserting he told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III&rsquo;s office that the president directed him to lie, the person said.</p>\n<p>Cohen is expected to present records of Trump&rsquo;s finances and recall alleged instances &ldquo;where Trump used high numbers for his purposes, such as getting on the top 10 wealthiest people on the Forbes list, and low numbers, when it came time to paying real estate taxes,&rdquo; the person said.</p>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s allies hope he could become this generation&rsquo;s John Dean &mdash; President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s White House counsel who famously testified to the Senate about Nixon&rsquo;s involvement in the Watergate scandal that ultimately led him to resign. Whether Cohen&rsquo;s testimony will be as impactful depends on the questions he is asked, the new facts he is able to present &mdash; and the evidence he has to back up his assertions.</p>\n<p>Here are 20 questions lawmakers could ask Cohen that might shed new light on the investigations swirling around Trump.</p>\n<p><b>1. You pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. In a memo for your sentencing, your attorney wrote, </b>&ldquo;<b>Furthermore, in the weeks during which his then-counsel prepared his written response to the congressional Committees, Michael remained in close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.&rdquo; (Client-1 refers to Trump.)</b></p>\n<p><b>Who are the &ldquo;White House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1&rdquo; that you remained in contact with, and what instruction did they give you about your testimony? </b></p>\n<p>Though Cohen has already admitted to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project in an effort to diminish the ongoing inquiries into Trump&rsquo;s possible ties with Russia, it remains unknown if others in Trump&rsquo;s orbit knew he planned to do so or, worse, directed him to do so.</p>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s defense attorney offered only this tantalizing hint during the sentencing process about Cohen&rsquo;s contact with &ldquo;White House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.&rdquo; Cohen could say who those people are, what they knew and when they knew it &mdash; which could have significant implications for them.</p>\n<p><b>2. BuzzFeed News reported that Trump directed you to lie to Congress, and that you told the special counsel as much. Describe any conversation you and Trump had about your testimony. Did he direct you to lie, and did you tell that to the special counsel&rsquo;s office? </b></p>\n<p>If Cohen were to testify that Trump explicitly directed him to lie to Congress, that would implicate the president in a plot to obstruct justice. At the same time, however, it would raise doubts about the credibility of the special counsel&rsquo;s office &mdash; which has disputed that is the account Cohen gave them.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Cohen could help clear up the mystery surrounding the controversial BuzzFeed report and detail what interactions, if any, he had with Trump about his testimony. Cohen&rsquo;s lawyer has written previously the lie &ldquo;sprung regrettably from Michael&rsquo;s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion of Client-1, to support and advance Client-1&rsquo;s political messaging.&rdquo; But was Cohen lying merely because he knew what Trump wanted, or because Trump told him to do so?</p>\n<p><b>3. Do you believe Trump obstructed any investigation, and do you have evidence to prove that? </b></p>\n<p>If Trump dangled a pardon to dissuade Cohen from cooperating with law enforcement, that could constitute obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p><b>5. Can you provide more information about the frequency and substance of your conversations with Trump about the Trump Tower Moscow project after January 2016? </b></p>\n<p>These conversations are important because Trump repeatedly said he had no business dealings in Russia. He tweeted in July 2016, &ldquo;For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,&rdquo; and told reporters in January 2017 that he had no deals there because he had &ldquo;stayed away.&rdquo; Cohen&rsquo;s describing his knowledge of a Trump Tower Moscow project could further expose those claims as false. Cohen has admitted he lied to Congress when he told lawmakers discussions about the project ceased after January 2016.</p>\n<p><b>6. Can you provide any further information about the frequency and substance of your discussions with Trump family members regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project? </b></p>\n<p>In his plea, Cohen admitted that he briefed Trump family members about the project, but no other details were offered.</p>\n<p>Cohen&rsquo;s plea says he &ldquo;asked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia,&rdquo; but it does not say who that official is.</p>\n<p><b>8. Please describe any contact you had with the Russian government about Trump Tower Moscow or other topics during the 2016 campaign.</b></p>\n<p>Cohen has described some limited interaction he had with the Russian government about the Trump Tower Moscow project, but this would give him an opportunity to offer more detail on it and other interactions.</p>\n<p><b>9. You have repeatedly denied the allegation contained in the so-called &ldquo;Steele dossier&rdquo; that you traveled to Prague during the campaign to meet with Russian operatives. Here today, under oath: Did you or anyone else associated with Donald Trump travel to Europe during the campaign to meet with anyone associated with the Russian government or acting on its behalf?</b></p>\n<p>Cohen has repeatedly and publicly denied this claim, which appears in the controversial dossier that levels lurid allegations against Trump, but his doing so under oath would be notable. Cohen, more than most, knows the consequences of lying under oath.</p>\n<p><b>10. To your knowledge, was President Trump ever informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. or anyone else before his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016?</b></p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly said he did not know that his son met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the campaign, and any information Cohen has to contradict the president&rsquo;s assertion would be significant.</p>\n<p><b>11. Do you believe that President Trump or anyone associated with his campaign coordinated with a Russian effort to interfere in the U.S. election?</b></p>\n<p>Cohen has previously insisted he is unaware of any evidence the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia. Any suggestion to the contrary now would be a bombshell.</p>\n<p><b>12. According to court documents, two Trump Organization executives were involved in 2017 with approving your reimbursement for money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The two executives agreed to describe monthly payments to you as legal services, the documents say, though you were no longer working for the company as a lawyer. Who were those two executives, and do you have reason to believe they knew at the time that that description was not accurate?</b></p>\n<p>Court documents do not name the executives. Their knowing the description was inaccurate might connect them to the wrongdoing to which Cohen already has pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p><b>13. How many times did you discuss payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels with President Trump before and after the 2016 election? Describe each of those conversations to the best of your memory. </b></p>\n<p>McDougal, a former Playboy model, and Daniels each alleged affairs with Trump &mdash; which Trump denies. By answering this question, Cohen would be connecting the president in more detail to his own wrongdoing, as he has admitted the payments violated campaign finance law.</p>\n<p><b>14. Did you ever discuss payments to McDougal and Daniels with other members of the Trump family? With other campaign officials? Describe those conversations.</b></p>\n<p><b>15. According to AMI&rsquo;s non-prosecution agreement, you met with AMI publisher David Pecker and a member of the Trump campaign in August 2015 to discuss how AMI could assist the campaign by buying and burying negative stories about President Trump&rsquo;s relationships with women. Was the campaign member President Trump? Please describe what occurred at that meeting.</b></p>\n<p>AMI is the parent company of the National Enquirer, and signed a non-prosecution agreement to avoid being charged in connection with the crimes to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. Cohen would be implicating Trump in connection with that wrongdoing if he places Trump at this meeting and describes any role he played. The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-played-central-role-in-hush-payoffs-to-stormy-daniels-and-karen-mcdougal-1541786601?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1\">previously reported</a> that Trump was at the meeting.</p>\n<p><b>16. AMI&rsquo;s agreement with the government also indicates that David Pecker agreed at that meeting to keep you apprised of any such stories when they arose. Please describe each instance you can recall where Pecker reached out to discuss a possible negative story regarding President Trump? </b> <b>Are you aware of other instances during the campaign when you helped arrange for people with potentially negative information to be paid for their silence? Please describe any such instances.</b></p>\n<p>Cohen pleaded guilty in connection with making hush payments to two women, but having worked for years as Trump&rsquo;s fixer, it is possible he is aware of other stories Trump wanted kept out of the media.</p>\n<p><b>17. What role, if any, did you play in the March 2016 AMI stories alleging, without evidence, that Sen. Ted Cruz had engaged in extramarital affairs? How about in the AMI story that suggested Senator Cruz&rsquo;s father could have played a role in assassinating President John F. Kennedy?</b></p>\n<p><b>18. Stormy Daniels has said that in 2011, when In Touch magazine was preparing to publish a story about her alleged affair with Donald Trump, a man threatened her and her infant daughter in a parking lot in Las Vegas. Do you believe that episode occurred, and were you involved in any way?</b></p>\n<p>A lawyer for Daniels has alleged this episode occurred and even released a sketch of a possible suspect, though law enforcement has never accused anyone of a crime in connection with the claim. Cohen has previously denied any knowledge of this alleged episode.</p>\n<p><b>19. In January 2018, you produced a letter purportedly from Daniels, denying an affair with the president. Did you discuss that statement with the president before writing and releasing it?</b></p>\n<p>As with many of the questions above, Cohen&rsquo;s answer would speak to Trump&rsquo;s possible involvement in trying to downplay or dispute allegations of marital infidelity.</p>\n<p><b>20. You have admitted that you lied the last time you testified before Congress, and you will be going to prison for that. Why should we believe you now?</b></p>\n<p>Republicans are likely to raise significant concerns about Cohen&rsquo;s credibility, with good reason. For his explosive assertions to stick, he will need to produce evidence that supports what he says.</p>",

                "text": "Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, is scheduled to testify before three congressional committees this week \u2014 two in private and one in a potentially explosive public hearing.\nCohen once proudly considered himself Trump\u2019s fixer, and there are few people closer to the president than he once was. He is expected to describe to lawmakers what he views as Trump\u2019s \u201clies, racism and cheating,\u201d both as president and in private business, and will describe \u201cpersonal, behind-the-scenes\u201d interactions he witnessed, a person familiar with the matter said.\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to multiple crimes, including arranging hush-money payments to women who alleged affairs with Trump, and lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. He is supposed to begin serving a three-year prison sentence in May.\nHe will testify Tuesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee and Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee \u2014 though only the oversight hearing is public.\nIn a statement Tuesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called Cohen a \u201cdisgraced felon,\u201d noting his past lies to lawmakers. \u201cSadly,\u201d the statement says, \u201che will go before Congress this week and we can expect more of the same. It\u2019s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.\u201d\nIn his testimony, Cohen is expected to detail his motives for having helped Trump and for now coming clean, the person familiar with the matter said. He will offer \u201cvery specific details\u201d \u2014 some of which have not yet been made public \u2014 about arranging the hush-money payments at Trump\u2019s direction, the person said. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the expected testimony.\nCohen also is expected to \u201cprovide more detail about his lies to Congress\u201d and address in some capacity a BuzzFeed News report asserting he told special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s office that the president directed him to lie, the person said.\nCohen is expected to present records of Trump\u2019s finances and recall alleged instances \u201cwhere Trump used high numbers for his purposes, such as getting on the top 10 wealthiest people on the Forbes list, and low numbers, when it came time to paying real estate taxes,\u201d the person said.\nCohen\u2019s allies hope he could become this generation\u2019s John Dean \u2014 President Richard Nixon\u2019s White House counsel who famously testified to the Senate about Nixon\u2019s involvement in the Watergate scandal that ultimately led him to resign. Whether Cohen\u2019s testimony will be as impactful depends on the questions he is asked, the new facts he is able to present \u2014 and the evidence he has to back up his assertions.\nHere are 20 questions lawmakers could ask Cohen that might shed new light on the investigations swirling around Trump.\n1. You pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a possible Trump Tower project in Moscow. In a memo for your sentencing, your attorney wrote, \u201cFurthermore, in the weeks during which his then-counsel prepared his written response to the congressional Committees, Michael remained in close and regular contact with White House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.\u201d (Client-1 refers to Trump.)\nWho are the \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1\u201d that you remained in contact with, and what instruction did they give you about your testimony?\nThough Cohen has already admitted to lying to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project in an effort to diminish the ongoing inquiries into Trump\u2019s possible ties with Russia, it remains unknown if others in Trump\u2019s orbit knew he planned to do so or, worse, directed him to do so.\nCohen\u2019s defense attorney offered only this tantalizing hint during the sentencing process about Cohen\u2019s contact with \u201cWhite House-based staff and legal counsel to Client-1.\u201d Cohen could say who those people are, what they knew and when they knew it \u2014 which could have significant implications for them.\n2. BuzzFeed News reported that Trump directed you to lie to Congress, and that you told the special counsel as much. Describe any conversation you and Trump had about your testimony. Did he direct you to lie, and did you tell that to the special counsel\u2019s office?\nIf Cohen were to testify that Trump explicitly directed him to lie to Congress, that would implicate the president in a plot to obstruct justice. At the same time, however, it would raise doubts about the credibility of the special counsel\u2019s office \u2014 which has disputed that is the account Cohen gave them.\nAt the very least, Cohen could help clear up the mystery surrounding the controversial BuzzFeed report and detail what interactions, if any, he had with Trump about his testimony. Cohen\u2019s lawyer has written previously the lie \u201csprung regrettably from Michael\u2019s effort, as a loyal ally and then-champion of Client-1, to support and advance Client-1\u2019s political messaging.\u201d But was Cohen lying merely because he knew what Trump wanted, or because Trump told him to do so?\n3. Do you believe Trump obstructed any investigation, and do you have evidence to prove that?\nIf Trump dangled a pardon to dissuade Cohen from cooperating with law enforcement, that could constitute obstruction of justice.\n5. Can you provide more information about the frequency and substance of your conversations with Trump about the Trump Tower Moscow project after January 2016?\nThese conversations are important because Trump repeatedly said he had no business dealings in Russia. He tweeted in July 2016, \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia,\u201d and told reporters in January 2017 that he had no deals there because he had \u201cstayed away.\u201d Cohen\u2019s describing his knowledge of a Trump Tower Moscow project could further expose those claims as false. Cohen has admitted he lied to Congress when he told lawmakers discussions about the project ceased after January 2016.\n6. Can you provide any further information about the frequency and substance of your discussions with Trump family members regarding the Trump Tower Moscow project?\nIn his plea, Cohen admitted that he briefed Trump family members about the project, but no other details were offered.\nCohen\u2019s plea says he \u201casked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia,\u201d but it does not say who that official is.\n8. Please describe any contact you had with the Russian government about Trump Tower Moscow or other topics during the 2016 campaign.\nCohen has described some limited interaction he had with the Russian government about the Trump Tower Moscow project, but this would give him an opportunity to offer more detail on it and other interactions.\n9. You have repeatedly denied the allegation contained in the so-called \u201cSteele dossier\u201d that you traveled to Prague during the campaign to meet with Russian operatives. Here today, under oath: Did you or anyone else associated with Donald Trump travel to Europe during the campaign to meet with anyone associated with the Russian government or acting on its behalf?\nCohen has repeatedly and publicly denied this claim, which appears in the controversial dossier that levels lurid allegations against Trump, but his doing so under oath would be notable. Cohen, more than most, knows the consequences of lying under oath.\n10. To your knowledge, was President Trump ever informed by his son Donald Trump Jr. or anyone else before his son took a meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016?\nTrump has repeatedly said he did not know that his son met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the campaign, and any information Cohen has to contradict the president\u2019s assertion would be significant.\n11. Do you believe that President Trump or anyone associated with his campaign coordinated with a Russian effort to interfere in the U.S. election?\nCohen has previously insisted he is unaware of any evidence the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia. Any suggestion to the contrary now would be a bombshell.\n12. According to court documents, two Trump Organization executives were involved in 2017 with approving your reimbursement for money paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. The two executives agreed to describe monthly payments to you as legal services, the documents say, though you were no longer working for the company as a lawyer. Who were those two executives, and do you have reason to believe they knew at the time that that description was not accurate?\nCourt documents do not name the executives. Their knowing the description was inaccurate might connect them to the wrongdoing to which Cohen already has pleaded guilty.\n13. How many times did you discuss payments to Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels with President Trump before and after the 2016 election? Describe each of those conversations to the best of your memory.\nMcDougal, a former Playboy model, and Daniels each alleged affairs with Trump \u2014 which Trump denies. By answering this question, Cohen would be connecting the president in more detail to his own wrongdoing, as he has admitted the payments violated campaign finance law.\n14. Did you ever discuss payments to McDougal and Daniels with other members of the Trump family? With other campaign officials? Describe those conversations.\n15. According to AMI\u2019s non-prosecution agreement, you met with AMI publisher David Pecker and a member of the Trump campaign in August 2015 to discuss how AMI could assist the campaign by buying and burying negative stories about President Trump\u2019s relationships with women. Was the campaign member President Trump? Please describe what occurred at that meeting.\nAMI is the parent company of the National Enquirer, and signed a non-prosecution agreement to avoid being charged in connection with the crimes to which Cohen has pleaded guilty. Cohen would be implicating Trump in connection with that wrongdoing if he places Trump at this meeting and describes any role he played. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Trump was at the meeting.\n16. AMI\u2019s agreement with the government also indicates that David Pecker agreed at that meeting to keep you apprised of any such stories when they arose. Please describe each instance you can recall where Pecker reached out to discuss a possible negative story regarding President Trump? Are you aware of other instances during the campaign when you helped arrange for people with potentially negative information to be paid for their silence? Please describe any such instances.\nCohen pleaded guilty in connection with making hush payments to two women, but having worked for years as Trump\u2019s fixer, it is possible he is aware of other stories Trump wanted kept out of the media.\n17. What role, if any, did you play in the March 2016 AMI stories alleging, without evidence, that Sen. Ted Cruz had engaged in extramarital affairs? How about in the AMI story that suggested Senator Cruz\u2019s father could have played a role in assassinating President John F. Kennedy?\n18. Stormy Daniels has said that in 2011, when In Touch magazine was preparing to publish a story about her alleged affair with Donald Trump, a man threatened her and her infant daughter in a parking lot in Las Vegas. Do you believe that episode occurred, and were you involved in any way?\nA lawyer for Daniels has alleged this episode occurred and even released a sketch of a possible suspect, though law enforcement has never accused anyone of a crime in connection with the claim. Cohen has previously denied any knowledge of this alleged episode.\n19. In January 2018, you produced a letter purportedly from Daniels, denying an affair with the president. Did you discuss that statement with the president before writing and releasing it?\nAs with many of the questions above, Cohen\u2019s answer would speak to Trump\u2019s possible involvement in trying to downplay or dispute allegations of marital infidelity.\n20. You have admitted that you lied the last time you testified before Congress, and you will be going to prison for that. Why should we believe you now?\nRepublicans are likely to raise significant concerns about Cohen\u2019s credibility, with good reason. For his explosive assertions to stick, he will need to produce evidence that supports what he says.",

India emphasized that it had not struck any Pakistani military targets and called the strike a &ldquo;preemptive action&rdquo; specifically aimed at countering Jaish-e-Muhammad.</p>\n<p>India&rsquo;s strike reflects its deep frustration with its neighbor, which it has accused of sheltering and sponsoring militants, something Pakistan denies.
