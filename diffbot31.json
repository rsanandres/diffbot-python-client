Here's a reminder of what's going on there: In recent years, <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2txFZpW\">millions</a> of people have fled the country as it deals with <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ItPDnM\">hyperinflation</a> and shortages of basics like food and medicine. Meanwhile, UNICEF has been warning of a <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2T3M2Rr\">malnutrition crisis</a> there.</p> <h3>Whose fault is that?</h3> <p>A lot of people <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2U2Pitk\">pin the blame</a> on the administration of Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, who's been president since 2013. Last year, he was re-elected but many called it a sham. Then last month, opposition leader and head of the country's parliament <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2T9I1HT\">Juan Guaid&oacute;</a> invoked the country's constitution and declared himself <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2AWsqEo\">interim president</a> until new elections happen.</p> <h3>How'd that go over?</h3> <p><a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2GU6EoB\">More than 50 countries</a> &ndash; including the US and most Latin American countries &ndash; have recognized Guaid&oacute; as Venezuela's leader. The Trump admin has thrown its full weight behind him and isn't ruling out military intervention. And tens of thousands of Venezuelans have turned out across the country to protest Maduro &ndash; with <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2SQ6WUG\">at least 40 people</a> being killed since last month.</p> <h3>So are there two presidents?</h3> <p>Kinda. And it's putting Venezuelans in the middle of it. The US and other countries have sent tens of millions of dollars' worth of humanitarian aid. But Maduro has been adamant that he won't let it in &ndash; calling it a cover for a US invasion. And says he won't let Venezuelans become &quot;<a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2U0wuuL\">beggars</a>.&quot; Guaid&oacute; says the aid is necessary and that one way or another, it's getting in tomorrow.</p> <h3>How?</h3> <p>Thanks to Venezuela's neighbor, Colombia &ndash; where some of the aid has been shipped to. Guaid&oacute;, lawmakers, and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to arrive at the Venezuela-Colombia border to help get it across. But Maduro said he's considering <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2T6U0sV\">closing</a> the Colombian border &ndash; a move he pulled with <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Nlto1V\">Brazil</a>. Colombian officials are reportedly ready to take down <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2BLEoRR\">border fences</a> to help Venezuelans get the aid across.</p> <h3>So this is the face-off.</h3> <p>Basically. And it has a lot of people &ndash; including those <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2STJ5Uc\">within Venezuela</a> &ndash; very, very nervous. Some see this event going one of two ways: maybe Maduro stands down and lets the aid pass through &ndash; a major win for the opposition. Or there's a possibility of violent clashes. A major win for no one.</p> <h3>theSkimm</h3> <p>Venezuela was once known for its <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Nl4nUP\">oil industry</a>. Now, it's dealing with an economic, political, and humanitarian crisis. And world leaders are <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2BJYNXm\">choosing sides</a>. Russia and Cuba are siding with Maduro. China is trying to be <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2MM7nZW\">neutral</a>. The US and many EU countries are siding with Guaid&oacute;, in what seems to be a face-off over political ideals and...ties to oil. <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2E6PFfY\">VP Mike Pence</a> will be in Colombia on Monday to try and seal the deal and get Maduro to step down.</p> <p><br></p><p><em><strong>Skimm More</strong>: We took it a step back to explain how Venezuela got in <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Tq6PLQ\">this political crisis</a>.</em></p> </td> </tr>    </tbody></table> </td> </tr>",

                "text": "Venezuela is bracing for a potential face-off this weekend.\nIf the Nicolas Cage movie taught me anything, a face-off is never good.\nThis one isn't expected to be either. Here's a reminder of what's going on there: In recent years, millions of people have fled the country as it deals with hyperinflation and shortages of basics like food and medicine. Meanwhile, UNICEF has been warning of a malnutrition crisis there.\nWhose fault is that?\nA lot of people pin the blame on the administration of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who's been president since 2013. Last year, he was re-elected but many called it a sham. Then last month, opposition leader and head of the country's parliament Juan Guaid\u00f3 invoked the country's constitution and declared himself interim president until new elections happen.\nHow'd that go over?\nMore than 50 countries \u2013 including the US and most Latin American countries \u2013 have recognized Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's leader. The Trump admin has thrown its full weight behind him and isn't ruling out military intervention. And tens of thousands of Venezuelans have turned out across the country to protest Maduro \u2013 with at least 40 people being killed since last month.\nSo are there two presidents?\nKinda. And it's putting Venezuelans in the middle of it. The US and other countries have sent tens of millions of dollars' worth of humanitarian aid. But Maduro has been adamant that he won't let it in \u2013 calling it a cover for a US invasion. And says he won't let Venezuelans become \"beggars.\" Guaid\u00f3 says the aid is necessary and that one way or another, it's getting in tomorrow.\nHow?\nThanks to Venezuela's neighbor, Colombia \u2013 where some of the aid has been shipped to. Guaid\u00f3, lawmakers, and hundreds of thousands of people are expected to arrive at the Venezuela-Colombia border to help get it across. But Maduro said he's considering closing the Colombian border \u2013 a move he pulled with Brazil. Colombian officials are reportedly ready to take down border fences to help Venezuelans get the aid across.\nSo this is the face-off.\nBasically. And it has a lot of people \u2013 including those within Venezuela \u2013 very, very nervous. Some see this event going one of two ways: maybe Maduro stands down and lets the aid pass through \u2013 a major win for the opposition. Or there's a possibility of violent clashes. A major win for no one.\ntheSkimm\nVenezuela was once known for its oil industry. Now, it's dealing with an economic, political, and humanitarian crisis. And world leaders are choosing sides. Russia and Cuba are siding with Maduro. China is trying to be neutral. The US and many EU countries are siding with Guaid\u00f3, in what seems to be a face-off over political ideals and...ties to oil. VP Mike Pence will be in Colombia on Monday to try and seal the deal and get Maduro to step down.\nSkimm More: We took it a step back to explain how Venezuela got in this political crisis.",

And while I shared my friends' trepidations, a voice inside of me whispered: &quot;I am ready now. Do I really have to wait?&quot; My biology concurred, as did my partner. A week after Election Day, I threw up in the toilet. I was pregnant.</p>\n<p>Anxiety is a normal part of parenthood. When you assume responsibility for a child's life, there comes a deep and relentless sense of vulnerability. Over the past few years, though, the emerging sociopolitical landscape &mdash; a climate of polarization and uncertainty &mdash; has heightened anxiety for both parents and non-parents across America. The <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2017/02/stressed-nation\">American Psychological Association</a> has recorded an increase in national anxiety among Republicans and Democrats alike; their surveys point to &quot;election stress&quot; and &quot;current political climate&quot; as significant factors. It is hardly a surprise, then, that in such conditions, people feel discouraged about starting or growing their families. Why bring children into a world that makes you despair?</p>\n<p>This sentiment isn't just anecdotal, it is quantifiable. A recent <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2723071\">study found that</a> demand for long-term birth control &mdash; like IUDs and implants &mdash; rose more than 20 percent in the month after the 2016 election. While the researchers suggest one reason for the rise could be a growing concern about accessibility to birth control, I would venture to guess that anxiety about what the future would be like for kids and parents may have also have played a role here.</p>\n<p>When I was pregnant with my first baby, the future seemed big and bright. Barack Obama was president, and hope was a natural byproduct of the &quot;yes we can&quot; era. For me, a white middle-class person, hope was also easy enough to take for granted. I did not follow the news obsessively because I trusted that the system, including its checks and balances, was reasonably on track. I trusted the nation's highest office was occupied by a person with dignity, values, and moral conscience. There was a strong sense that much of the world nodded in approval. Believing our country to be stable and fairly united afforded me the luxury of turning inward, towards the transformation of motherhood; a privilege for which I was &mdash; and still am &mdash; very grateful.</p>\n<p>But now, everything feels different. Sometimes it even feels hopeless. Our country no longer welcomes immigrants in with open arms or aims to uplift families; if you work hard, there is no guarantee you will be able to pay your bills, afford health care, or climb up in the socioeconomic ranks. True, Trump cannot be blamed entirely for these injustices, but his policies inarguably further economic inequality; threaten the rights of women, minorities, and the LGBTQ community; promote xenophobia; and ignore the catastrophic impact of climate change. Hate crimes and the raging suicide and opioid epidemics have increased sharply under his regime.</p>\n<p>After I found out I was pregnant, anxiety quickly dampened my excitement as I fretted about the future. The growing curve of my belly represented a vivid divide between the peacefulness of my inner sanctum and the toxic, fear-based culture churning on the outside. I struggled to reconcile this odd feeling of nurturing innocence during a time of turmoil, hate, and mistrust. I found myself alternating between both sides of the divide: either humming softly and turning in tenderly towards my baby &mdash; or baring my teeth and growling at the news reel like a mama wolf protecting her pup. I thought about how mothers all around the world give birth in much more extreme conditions, and the strength and courage they live by every day, and this humbled me. But in a way, I was in no hurry for my baby to come out.</p>\n<p>On Inauguration Day, I was three months pregnant. I lay alone on the couch, curled into a ball, watching the transfer of powers on TV. While mourning the loss of the nation's first female president, I also prepared for a future of guaranteed patriarchy. I wondered: What would it mean for our two little girls to grow up during the Trump era?</p>\n<p>My baby was estimated for arrival on the same day as a solar eclipse &mdash; one of the darkest days of the year &mdash; which felt fitting somehow. On that day, I remember the moon smudging out the sun. For a few eerie moments, darkness took over. When my baby chose a different day to be born, the sun was reassuringly high in the sky, and I felt grateful and ready for her to come out.</p>\n<p>My baby is 17 months old now. Under Trump, American women face some dire prospects: soaring economic inequalities, rising health-care prices, rocketing educational costs and debts, along with attempts to roll back reproductive rights.</p>\n<p>And yet, despite it all, I remain hopeful.</p>\n<p>Every day, I watch my baby grow more independent, more fully integrated, more alive in this complicated world. When we visit the bunny rabbits at the local farm and her pudgy arms and legs dance excitedly, or she pretend-reads <em>Goodnight Gorilla </em>in her sister's lap, I can't help but smile. As a mother navigating the troubled waters of our times, I strive to remain optimistic for the sake of my daughters. I believe it's my job to uphold the same values of hope, love, and truth that our children unconsciously espouse.

Many Republicans may privately curse the president's bizarre behavior and questionable judgment. Democrats may fret about the administration's incipient fascism. But the prospect of a war to topple a foreign government &mdash; in this case the government of Nicol&aacute;s Maduro in Venezuela &mdash; is all it takes to restore a sense of bipartisan comity in Washington. At last, something to make everyone feel good about themselves, united in the common cause of demonstrating our power and righteousness.</p>\n<p>In reality, military intervention in the standoff in Venezuela will only display our hubris and incapacity to learn from mistakes.</p>\n<p>Let's make one thing perfectly clear: Maduro's predecessor as president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, single-handedly wrecked the country's economy, and Maduro has made it far worse. The people of Venezuela would be better off if Maduro stepped down, allowing Juan Guaid&oacute;, president of the National Assembly, to take over as interim president, with elections to follow. But that doesn't mean that the United States should be placing itself in the role of orchestrating these events, especially if doing so requires the use of military force to remove Maduro and install Guaid&oacute;.</p>\n<p>What happens inside Venezuela simply isn't our responsibility. The question that cries out for an answer is why so many Americans conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>Bad things happen in the world. Governments make mistakes, treat their citizens poorly, violate their rights, exacerbate their suffering. Everyone with a sense of moral decency and a capacity for empathy will lament this reality. But that doesn't mean that it's our place to use our immense military might to change it.</p>\n<p>Why not? For one thing, because our government's singular responsibility is the well-being of Americans. It exceeds the capacity of any country, even one as wealthy and powerful as ours, to take on responsibility for the citizens of other nations &mdash; who live elsewhere, who are not members of our political community, who have no say in our political system, who contribute nothing in taxes or economic productivity to our government or country. The world is not a single political entity ruled by the American president and policed by the American military.</p>\n<p>But even if you deny this and insist that what happens inside a country on another continent <em>does</em> place a moral obligation on the American government and armed forces, there remains the matter of whether acting on its basis will actually make things better for those who are suffering &mdash; and what the moral consequences of failure will be.</p>\n<p>The fact is that the United States is extremely bad at this. Do we have the capacity to topple a foreign government? Yes, we certainly do. And we unquestionably love to do it. The hatred of tyrants is a very old American national trait. But what comes next? We easily overthrew the Taliban in Afghanistan 17 years ago; the country remains a basket case. We easily overthrew Saddam Hussein in Iraq nearly 16 years ago; it ignited a civil war that tore the country apart, led to over 100,000 deaths, and destabilized an entire region. We easily overthrew the government of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya eight years ago; the country has been consumed by violence ever since.</p>\n<p>How many times will the United States make the same mistake while refusing to learn any meaningful lesson at all? Deposing a government is relatively easy. Securing peace, preventing chaos, managing a transition to a functional government &mdash; one strong enough to maintain order but limited enough to be a meaningful improvement on the former regime &mdash; is <em>extremely </em>difficult. All of the evidence of recent history points toward it being a task that exceeds the capacity of the United States.</p>\n<p>In the specific case of Venezuela, the more Guaid&oacute; is viewed as owing his power to American intervention, the more his political enemies will ensure that he's known as a puppet of the United States, undermining any attempt to establish his own legitimacy and increasing the likelihood that the Venezuelan military opts to take charge instead. Do we then act to overthrow the Venezuelan military? And if so, what comes next? American occupation? An attempt to place someone else in charge? Or do we instead grow bored and weary, blame the natives for their failure to receive the selfless American gift of freedom, and give up, leaving the country to descend into the anarchy we have bequeathed to so many places over the past two decades?</p>\n<p>Have those itching for war done the hard thinking required to negotiate these exceedingly likely outcomes of American intervention? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1099726515292508162\">Nothing from the present</a> or recent past gives us any reason to think so.</p>\n<p>That's why there can be no obligation to intervene &mdash; because there cannot be a moral duty to make things worse.</p>\n<p>So let's hope for the best in Venezuela but not suppose it's our responsibility to try and fix their problems for them. We will only end up implicating ourselves in the further suffering to follow.</p>",

This doesn't save them from the educational-industrial complex. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/business/cosmetology-school-debt-iowa.html\">reported</a> recently on the plight of a young woman in Iowa who went $21,000 into debt in order to obtain a &quot;license&quot; for cutting hair and filing and shaping fingernails.</p>\n<p>Tracy Lozano is an eminently practical young woman who if interested in Sanskirt verbs or Dogu statues of the late Jomon period has wisely decided to save these things for the weekend and earn a living instead. After investing roughly the price of a down payment on a reasonably nice home in rural Iowa on this piece of paper, she found herself eligible for a position at a Great Clips chain that paid her $9 an hour.

This doesn't save them from the educational-industrial complex. The New York Times reported recently on the plight of a young woman in Iowa who went $21,000 into debt in order to obtain a \"license\" for cutting hair and filing and shaping fingernails.\nTracy Lozano is an eminently practical young woman who if interested in Sanskirt verbs or Dogu statues of the late Jomon period has wisely decided to save these things for the weekend and earn a living instead. After investing roughly the price of a down payment on a reasonably nice home in rural Iowa on this piece of paper, she found herself eligible for a position at a Great Clips chain that paid her $9 an hour. Even after supplementing her guild-sponsored employment with another job \u2014 at Pizza Hut: apparently dough-folding and cheese-scattering have so far managed to remain outside the purview of Hawkeye state licensing authorities \u2014 she was able to earn about $25,000 a year. After 13 years of work she still owes the Iowa School of Beauty by way of her creditors more than $8,000.\nThis is insane. I won't go as far as some of the old farmers I know who insist that anybody with two hands and half a brain can drive an 18-wheeler, but I do think it's hard not to argue that American credentialism is out of hand and getting worse. (As recently as 2015, the state of Tennessee decided that barbers had to have high-school diplomas, no doubt because the otherwise lively discussions of To Kill a Mockingbird and quadratic equations that take place in such establishments were being drowned out by the raving of these unlicensed maniacs.)\nI for one believe that commercial drivers licenses are a necessary thing. Ditto the restrictions that we rightly impose upon the ability of any lunatic to declare himself a dentist and start drilling away with the Crafstman in his garage. But hair? Come on. This isn't exactly life or death. Besides, expensive credentialing requirements have failed to rid the world of bad haircuts. If the guildmasters at the various state licensing boards really believed their own drivel, they would take one look at what happened to Shia LeBeouf here and start demanding that cosmetologists devote six or more years to writing dissertations on \"The history of bangs in France: 1960-1963\" before they so much as touch a pair of clippers.\nWhen I was a writing tutor at one of our directional state universities years ago, I often assisted nursing students. These were invariably among the cleverest and most conscientious undergraduates I ever worked with. They were also the nicest. Most of them were if not happy at least willing to spend four years of their lives memorizing the types of plankton in biology courses. They were less enthusiastic about the cost. But they put up with it for the very simple reason that they all wanted one thing: to help people.\nWe should not put a financial barrier between would-be nurses and their worthy ambition. This is true, among other reasons, because it is not at all clear that the ability to earn high grades in what is essentially a pre-medical school curriculum is the most important quality in a prospective nurse. But the answer to the student debt crisis here is not to throw trillions of dollars of free tuition money at the pizza dispensers and bureaucrats and dorm-upgrading contractors in the universities but to make it possible for people to work as nurses without earning four-year degrees. In the 1940s the United States and Britain managed to train hundreds of thousands of nurses virtually overnight with nothing but practical, on-the-job training. Already there is a widespread consensus among practicing nurses in the United Kingdom that degree programs are unnecessary. We should follow their lead. A two-year training course at a community college, combined with practical experience in hospitals, should be enough.\nThe same is true of my own profession. In happier times, journalism was a blue-collar job for drunks in hats who banged out nonsense with typewriters they positioned in corners of their favorite saloons. Nowadays we have undergraduate and graduate degrees in writing the news. A lot of good it's done the industry. You could draw an amusing graph plotting the decline of newspapers across the country against the rise of journalism as a pseudo-academic discipline. The prospect of having to sit through hundreds of hours of yawn-inducing pseudoscience about pedagogy has prevented more than one person \u2014 the author of this column included \u2014 from becoming a teacher. Anyone with a degree in a relevant area \u2014 English, history, foreign languages \u2014 should be able to teach it at the secondary level.\nDon't get me wrong. As someone with a penchant for guild socialism, I like to dream of a neo-medievalist future where the Barbers Society and the Sovereign Nurses Guild and the Fraternity of Mostly Sober Hacks require their would-be initiates to undergo years of elaborate and highly ritualized training \u2014 and even organize singing contests among members. In the real world, though, someone who wants to give me a buzz cut or help me lose weight or advise me on my choice of houseplants needs a special piece of paper about as much he or she does a sentence to involuntary debt servitude.\nToo bad those are the same thing.",

It seems another outbreak of wistfulness for the presidency of George W. Bush is upon us. The source of that outbreak is somewhat improbable, though: Retired Nevada Sen. Harry Reid &mdash; the Democrat who once stood as one of Bush's most vocal foes &mdash; is suddenly feeling nostalgic.</p>\n<p>&quot;He and I had our differences, but no one ever questioned his patriotism,&quot; Reid said of Bush in a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/25/politics/harry-reid-dana-bash-cnntv/index.html\">CNN interview</a>. &quot;Our battles were strictly political battles.&quot; President Trump, on the other hand, makes Reid miss having Bush in the Oval Office &quot;every day.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trump, of course, reacted to the comparison with an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1100015815515082752\">angry tweet.</a> But Trump's response, and Reid's criticism, missed the point. In truth, the differences between the two presidents are distinctions of degree, not of kind, and they have been magnified by <a href=\"https://qz.com/1485596/george-w-bush-gave-michelle-obama-candy-at-his-fathers-funeral/\">cheap nostalgia</a>. George W. Bush was a very bad president. Donald Trump is worse. But in many ways, Trump's presidency merely amplifies the worst tendencies of the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>If you need an illustration, just look to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-prepares-to-vote-to-overturn-trumps-emergency-declaration/2019/02/25/343657f2-3918-11e9-b10b-f05a22e75865_story.html?utm_term=.76cb4223b571\">Capitol Hill</a>, where the House of Representatives is expected to vote to overturn Trump's recent declaration of a national emergency designed to bypass Congress in order to build an anti-immigrant wall on America's southern border. Trump's attempt to end-run Congress is <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/823979/republicans-dont-care-about-constitution-trumps-national-emergency-proves\">plainly unconstitutional</a>, but it is also rooted in the excesses of the Bush administration during the first years after 9/11, when the president and his lawyers routinely asserted the right to disregard Congress on everything from decisions to build new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/29/usa.elanaschor1\">military bases</a>, make <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8702754/ns/politics/\">personnel appointments</a>, and even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/29/us/brett-kavanaugh-signing-statements.html\">torture terror suspects</a>.</p>\n<p>In so many ways &mdash; right down to their shared tendency to hand out stupid, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_used_by_George_W._Bush\">belittling</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_used_by_Donald_Trump\">nicknames</a> &mdash; Bush laid the foundation for Trump. Here are three more examples:</p>\n<p>First, Bush practiced the politics of divide and conquer. Rather than try to broaden his appeal, his campaign in 2004 decided instead to focus on getting the GOP base to the polls &mdash; and did so by promoting a series of anti-gay measures on state ballots throughout the country: Eleven states, <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/GAY-MARRIAGE-Did-issue-help-re-elect-Bush-2677003.php\">including Ohio</a>, passed bans on gay marriage, which gave Bush a narrow victory in that year's election. His victory came at the expense of an oppressed and scapegoated minority. That effort is clearly echoed in Trump's push to build the wall, an anti-immigrant measure that is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/upshot/trump-border-wall-polls.html\">widely unpopular</a> except within the narrow confines of the president's base.</p>\n<p>Second, the Bush administration made clear early on it favored tax cuts over fiscal responsibility. Bush, you'll remember inherited a budget surplus from President Clinton when he entered office in 2001. When he left office in 2009, the national debt <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/01/25/133211508/the-weekly-standard-obama-vs-bush-on-debt\">had doubled</a>. Under Trump, the national debt has <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/12/national-debt-tops-22-trillion-first-time-ever/2849978002/\">topped $22 trillion</a>. Republicans talk a lot about the sins of deficit spending, but they're the worst practitioners when they hold the White House. Democrats are usually left to clean up <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/814740/once-again-democrats-have-clean-gops-mess\">the mess</a> rather than pursue their own priorities.</p>\n<p>Finally, Bush's disasters &mdash; in Iraq, during Hurricane Katrina, and in leaving behind the Great Recession &mdash; so tainted his family's name that when 2016 rolled around, his big brother Jeb was easily dispatched by Trump during the GOP primaries, despite Jeb's massive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/us/politics/jeb-bush-campaign.html\">financial backing</a> from the party establishment. A party that has traditionally nominated establishment favorites for the presidency instead gave the reins to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apprentice_(U.S._TV_series)\">reality TV</a> star.</p>\n<p>The similarities between the two men are both political &mdash; consider <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/rumsfeld-repeats-old-europe-comments/a-890806\">the disregard</a> each has shown for longtime <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/01/trump-privately-discussed-destroying-nato-alliance\">American allies</a> &mdash; and personal. Both men seemed to fail upwards into the presidency, able to sustain their careers thanks mainly to the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/trumps-small-loan-from-his-father-was-more-like-60point7-million-nyt.html\">money</a> and <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/how-george-w-bush-scored-big-with-the-texas-rangers/\">connections</a> of their more-accomplished fathers.</p>\n<p>There are differences, but they mostly come down to style: Bush appears more amiable than Trump. But the presidency isn't a congeniality contest. In all the ways that matter, the two men are far too similar.</p>\n<p>There's no reason for Reid or anybody else to feel nostalgia for Bush's presidency. The nation's 43rd president left the country in worse shape than he found it; Trump seems destined to do the same. All of us should be hoping it's not too long before Trump joins Bush in retirement.</p>",

But they're fooling themselves. Trump is not diminishing America's military footprint; if anything, he's expanding it.</p>\n<p>This is a shame.

But the latter diplomatic overture is shaping up to be a complete bust, and the former pullouts are just as partial as former President Obama's was from Iraq. Just as Obama ended up succumbing and leaving a rump American force in Iraq, Trump too, for all his tough talk, has flipped on his original promise to fully withdraw from Syria. He is saying now that he's <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-says-he-agrees-100-percent-keeping-u-s-troops-n979466\">&quot;100 percent&quot;</a> on board with a residual troop presence.

So it may be understandable why Trump wouldn't prioritize it. But Trump doesn't want to pull out even from disputes such as Saudi Arabia's offensive against Houthi insurgents in Yemen where there is widespread consensus that America has no business getting involved. The Senate even passed a resolution <a href=\"http://reason.com/blog/2019/03/14/yemen-war-resolution-in-senate-roundup\">54-47 last week</a> demanding that Trump stop using American forces to assist Saudis with midair refueling and target assistance, especially since he has no Congressional authorization to do so. Trump's response? A <a href=\"https://reason.com/blog/2019/03/14/yemen-war-resolution-in-senate-roundup?utm_medium=email\">pledge</a> to veto the bill.</p>\n<p>But why exactly is Trump so gung-ho about helping Saudi Arabia, a monstrous regime that killed and dismembered an American resident because he had the temerity to criticize it?

On Wednesday, the United States <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/canada-737-max.html\">finally banned</a> flights of the aircraft, following the same decision by 42 other countries. The Max 8 was Boeing's best selling aircraft ever, but one of the planes crashed on Sunday, and another crashed back in October. Both disasters may be linked to the same glitch.</p>\n<p>You'd think this could be an existential threat to the aircraft manufacturer. There are 4,600 outstanding orders for the Max 8 around the world &mdash; $550 <em>billion</em> in expected future revenue. Max 8 sales this year were projected to be almost a third of Boeing's annual revenue. Not surprisingly, the company's stock is down about 11 percent.</p>\n<p>But in truth, Boeing will probably cruise through this episode unscathed.</p>\n<p>Analyses of the crashes are ongoing. But in the October crash, it looks like a particular autopilot function, relying on a single sensor, miscalculated and pitched the plane into an unexpected dive. Pilots across the world &mdash; including the U.S. &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/world/africa/boeing-ethiopian-airlines-plane-crash.html\">have been complaining</a> about this glitch for a while. And there's circumstantial evidence the same thing happened in Sunday's crash.</p>\n<p>Since the October crash, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-to-make-key-change-in-max-cockpit-software-11552413489?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\">Boeing has been working</a> on a software update to fix the problem: Have the autopilot function rely on input from multiple sensors, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/11/boeing-had-best-selling-growing-global-market-now-after-two-crashes-its-reputation-is-risk/\">along with changes</a> to &quot;flight control law, pilot displays, operation manuals, and crew training.&quot; The fix was originally due in January, but was delayed by &quot;differences of opinion about technical and engineering issues,&quot; between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as by the recent government shutdown, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-to-make-key-change-in-max-cockpit-software-11552413489?ns=prod/accounts-wsj\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a>. In the interim, Boeing issued some new guidance to pilots. And &quot;the FAA concluded the delay was acceptable because its experts agreed with Boeing that there was no imminent safety threat,&quot; according to one of the<i> Journal's</i> sources. U.S. regulators now want the fix finished by the end of April, though new information gleaned from Sunday's crash could extend the timeline.</p>\n<p>Now, that's not the most encouraging chain of events. But the gist is that all of the Max 8s currently in service, as well as all the aircraft on order, can be fixed. Barring something truly unforeseen, the grounding will almost certainly be temporary &mdash; a few months, give or take.</p>\n<p>Analysts <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/business/boeing-737-manufacturer-cost.html\">told</a> <em>The</em> <i>New York Times</i> that fixing the software problem could cost Boeing $1 billion. Then there are the 350 aircraft already out there, and airlines aren't inclined to just eat the costs of keeping those Max 8s on the ground. &quot;We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft,&quot; Bjorn Kjos, the CEO of Norwegian Air, told the <i>Times</i>. Leasing a replacement jet for three months likely costs $1 million a pop, so multiply that by 350 and add it to Boeing's price tag, too. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/11/boeing-had-best-selling-growing-global-market-now-after-two-crashes-its-reputation-is-risk/\">Another estimate</a> for <em>The</em> <i>Washington Post</i> put the worst-case scenario at a $5.1 billion hit to Boeing over two months.</p>\n<p>But those numbers also have to be put <a href=\"http://investors.boeing.com/investors/investor-news/press-release-details/2019/Boeing-Reports-Record-2018-Results-and-Provides-2019-Guidance/default.aspx\">in context</a>. Boeing's total revenue for 2018 was just over $100 billion and its total profits were just over $10 billion. You could double that worst-case scenario estimate, and you'd merely knock out Boeing's profits for 2019. And that hit won't continue year after year. For a company like Boeing, profits are gravy: They come after all operating costs, including wages and salaries and taxes, have already been paid. The only thing they fund are shareholder payouts.</p>\n<p>That could certainly affect the company's stock. But a lower stock price has little effect on Boeing proper &mdash; it mostly hurts Wall Street traders. Simply put, even the worst-worst-case scenario would barely make a dent in Boeing's bottom line. And those huge revenue streams also mean Boeing could almost certainly weather any lawsuits over the crisis.</p>\n<p>Finally, assuming Boeing does fix the issue in the next few months, it's unlikely that customers will wiggle out of those 4,600 orders. Airlines usually pay 20 percent of the orders upfront, and getting out of those contracts is not easy. Beyond that, Boeing enjoys a near monopoly status in this instance: The Max 8's only real market competitor is the A320neo, from the European manufacturer Airbus, and there's already a multi-year backlog of orders for that plane. If Boeing can make a reasonable case that it's repaired the glitch, customers will find that dropping their orders will be more trouble than it's worth. &quot;I don't think anyone will abandon them,&quot; Jonathan G. Ornstein, the CEO of Mesa Airlines, told the <i>Times</i>.</p>\n<p>The big unknown here is damage to Boeing's reputation. I've just given a pretty technical and bloodless assessment of Boeing's business chances. But 346 people are dead quite likely because Boeing screwed up.</p>\n<p>Reputational damage is an inherently unpredictable and unquantifiable thing. But given everything laid out above, there are many structural barriers that reputational damage would have to overcome to seriously threaten the company.</p>\n<p>In fact, this isn't even the first time a screw-up has grounded Boeing's planes recently. Batteries randomly catching fire <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/faa-orders-grounding-of-us-operated-boeing-787s.html\">temporarily grounded</a> the company's Dreamliner in 2013, but Boeing suffered no noticeable long-term damage as a result. This crisis is obviously much worse. But the fact is, due to Boeing's sheer size and reach, it will most likely be consigned to the history books as well.</p>\n<p>Whether you think that's a <i>good</i> thing is another matter entirely.</p>",

Barring something truly unforeseen, the grounding will almost certainly be temporary \u2014 a few months, give or take.\nAnalysts told The New York Times that fixing the software problem could cost Boeing $1 billion. Then there are the 350 aircraft already out there, and airlines aren't inclined to just eat the costs of keeping those Max 8s on the ground. \"We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft,\" Bjorn Kjos, the CEO of Norwegian Air, told the Times. Leasing a replacement jet for three months likely costs $1 million a pop, so multiply that by 350 and add it to Boeing's price tag, too. Another estimate for The Washington Post put the worst-case scenario at a $5.1 billion hit to Boeing over two months.\nBut those numbers also have to be put in context. Boeing's total revenue for 2018 was just over $100 billion and its total profits were just over $10 billion. You could double that worst-case scenario estimate, and you'd merely knock out Boeing's profits for 2019. And that hit won't continue year after year. For a company like Boeing, profits are gravy: They come after all operating costs, including wages and salaries and taxes, have already been paid. The only thing they fund are shareholder payouts.\nThat could certainly affect the company's stock. But a lower stock price has little effect on Boeing proper \u2014 it mostly hurts Wall Street traders. Simply put, even the worst-worst-case scenario would barely make a dent in Boeing's bottom line. And those huge revenue streams also mean Boeing could almost certainly weather any lawsuits over the crisis.\nFinally, assuming Boeing does fix the issue in the next few months, it's unlikely that customers will wiggle out of those 4,600 orders. Airlines usually pay 20 percent of the orders upfront, and getting out of those contracts is not easy. Beyond that, Boeing enjoys a near monopoly status in this instance: The Max 8's only real market competitor is the A320neo, from the European manufacturer Airbus, and there's already a multi-year backlog of orders for that plane. If Boeing can make a reasonable case that it's repaired the glitch, customers will find that dropping their orders will be more trouble than it's worth. \"I don't think anyone will abandon them,\" Jonathan G. Ornstein, the CEO of Mesa Airlines, told the Times.\nThe big unknown here is damage to Boeing's reputation. I've just given a pretty technical and bloodless assessment of Boeing's business chances. But 346 people are dead quite likely because Boeing screwed up.\nReputational damage is an inherently unpredictable and unquantifiable thing. But given everything laid out above, there are many structural barriers that reputational damage would have to overcome to seriously threaten the company.\nIn fact, this isn't even the first time a screw-up has grounded Boeing's planes recently. Batteries randomly catching fire temporarily grounded the company's Dreamliner in 2013, but Boeing suffered no noticeable long-term damage as a result. This crisis is obviously much worse. But the fact is, due to Boeing's sheer size and reach, it will most likely be consigned to the history books as well.\nWhether you think that's a good thing is another matter entirely.",

Proximate motivations were not hard to discover. The alleged terrorist, a 28-year-old man from Australia, posted a white supremacist tract online where he lauded President Trump as a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-offers-us-assistance-after-horrible-massacre-in-new-zealand/2019/03/15/931833d2-4712-11e9-aaf8-4512a6fe3439_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2df6a09d9c1d\">symbol of white identity</a>.&quot; He livestreamed the shooting, in which he repeated many white nationalist slogans and recommended that viewers &quot;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-shooting-updates-christchurch.html\">subscribe to PewDiePie</a>&quot; (YouTube's most popular independent channel, which is somehow constantly getting in trouble for &quot;ironic&quot; racism).</p>\n<p>One important aspect of this horror is how the internet enables the spread of genocidal propaganda. Worldwide peer-to-peer communication networks makes it easier than ever for hatred and racist conspiracy theories to spread.</p>\n<p>But just as important is the political background. Powerful conservative activists, media figures, and politicians around the world have deliberately stoked hysterical anti-Muslim bigotry for political advantage. It should not be surprising if occasionally some of their supporters follow their words to their logical conclusions.</p>\n<p>Ben Shapiro &mdash; whose tweets, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andyriga/status/985939322263228417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Canadian court documents</a>, were regularly read by Alexandre Bissonnette, the right-wing terrorist who shot up a Quebec mosque &mdash; has used <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/05/ben-shapiro/shapiro-says-majority-muslims-are-radicals/\">ridiculously slanted statistics</a> to argue that the majority of Muslims (or <i>800 million </i>people, by his count) are &quot;radical&quot; terrorist sympathizers. He has also promoted <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/388621/why-doesnt-the-new-york-times-mention-ben-shapiros-islamophobia/\">an article he allegedly edited</a> saying that Muslims living in Europe constitute a &quot;disease&quot; and that Muslim men are &quot;uncivilized.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2015/12/more-than-few-islamic-extremists/?utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_content=5667aeff04d3016bf289ee1e&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter\">David French wrote in <i>National Review</i></a> in 2015 (again wildly exaggerating the implications of opinion polls) that the Muslim world is &quot;overcome with hate&quot; and that &quot;jihadists represent the natural and inevitable outgrowth of a faith that is given over to hate on a massive scale.&quot;</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking &mdash; many if not most Muslims are terrorists or &quot;radicals,&quot; and should be collectively instead of individually judged &mdash; is why President Trump has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/18/18188476/trump-muslim-prayer-rugs-tweet-border\">stoked fear</a> about Muslims sneaking across the southern border and proposed (and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html\">partly accomplished</a>) banning all Muslim entry into the United States.</p>\n<p>Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) &mdash; who, among other things, <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Louie-Gohmert-at-it-again-this-time-over-the-9236767.php\">accused the Obama administration </a>of being infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood &mdash; <a href=\"https://gohmert.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398693&fbclid=IwAR1UahkLAka3iNV21-NQF8DZCAvwDpQPJId4wVNsI0wpHkLxmGAXrj1JnCg\">implicitly admitted</a> some overlap with the Christchurch terrorist. He argued in a statement not that the murderer's racism was wrong, but that he didn't use the correct channels: &quot;There are courts, dispute resolutions, and legislatures to resolve controversies[.]&quot; Which &quot;controversy&quot; he means is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>\n<p>An extreme right-wing Australian senator named Fraser Anning straight-up blamed the victims themselves for the massacre, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1106516923922239489\">issuing a statement</a> that read: &quot;The real cause of the bloodshed ... is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place &hellip; just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, that does not make them blameless.&quot;</p>\n<p>This barely-veiled apologia for terrorism conceals a strong political motive. Indeed, this is far from the first time that powerful right-wingers have attempted to stoke bigotry for political advantage. In Imperial Russia in 1911, for instance, the top levels of the tsarist government (including the minister of justice and Tsar Nicholas II himself) <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2335459/jewish/The-Tsars-Scapegoats-Beilis-the-Chassidim-and-the-Jews.htm\">conspired to frame a Jewish clerk named Menachem Mendel Beilis</a> for the &quot;ritual murder&quot; of a Ukrainian boy &mdash; a classic piece of blood libel anti-Semitism. The actual murderers (who were not Jews) were quickly discovered by police and journalists, but the authorities hushed it up.</p>\n<p>The case attracted a storm of international condemnation, but the tsarist regime pressed on with the frame-up. The reason is that the frenzy of hatred served an important political function &mdash; namely, building mass popular support for the autocracy. (Luckily for Beilis, the prosecution's case was so shoddy that he was acquitted at trial.)</p>\n<p>Similar to how war fever can inspire mass demonstrations of patriotic loyalty, stoking violent anti-Semitism (which produced clockwork bloody pogroms from reactionary &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hundreds\">Black Hundreds</a>&quot; militias) provided both some social glue for a right-wing empire and a convenient scapegoat for any problems that cropped up. In the end, it didn't save Imperial Russia, but the truly enormous potential of political bigotry would later be demonstrated by Hitler and Nazi Germany.</p>\n<p>Political Islamophobia from Alaska to Australia serves as a key ideological unifier for modern right-wing movements, because they have little policy content which is practically useful for their mass base. Right-wing oligarchs like Trump may not actually roll back globalization, or do any major domestic policy but tax cuts and deregulation, but they can provide a compelling (and wholly fictional) narrative of white civilization under threat. White supremacist terrorism across the whole Western world is just the price to be paid.</p>",

Powerful conservative activists, media figures, and politicians around the world have deliberately stoked hysterical anti-Muslim bigotry for political advantage. It should not be surprising if occasionally some of their supporters follow their words to their logical conclusions.\nBen Shapiro \u2014 whose tweets, according to Canadian court documents, were regularly read by Alexandre Bissonnette, the right-wing terrorist who shot up a Quebec mosque \u2014 has used ridiculously slanted statistics to argue that the majority of Muslims (or 800 million people, by his count) are \"radical\" terrorist sympathizers. He has also promoted an article he allegedly edited saying that Muslims living in Europe constitute a \"disease\" and that Muslim men are \"uncivilized.\" David French wrote in National Review in 2015 (again wildly exaggerating the implications of opinion polls) that the Muslim world is \"overcome with hate\" and that \"jihadists represent the natural and inevitable outgrowth of a faith that is given over to hate on a massive scale.\"\nThis kind of thinking \u2014 many if not most Muslims are terrorists or \"radicals,\" and should be collectively instead of individually judged \u2014 is why President Trump has stoked fear about Muslims sneaking across the southern border and proposed (and partly accomplished) banning all Muslim entry into the United States.\nRep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) \u2014 who, among other things, accused the Obama administration of being infiltrated by the Muslim Brotherhood \u2014 implicitly admitted some overlap with the Christchurch terrorist. He argued in a statement not that the murderer's racism was wrong, but that he didn't use the correct channels: \"There are courts, dispute resolutions, and legislatures to resolve controversies[.]\" Which \"controversy\" he means is left as an exercise for the reader.\nAn extreme right-wing Australian senator named Fraser Anning straight-up blamed the victims themselves for the massacre, issuing a statement that read: \"The real cause of the bloodshed ... is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place \u2026 just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, that does not make them blameless.\"\nThis barely-veiled apologia for terrorism conceals a strong political motive. Indeed, this is far from the first time that powerful right-wingers have attempted to stoke bigotry for political advantage. In Imperial Russia in 1911, for instance, the top levels of the tsarist government (including the minister of justice and Tsar Nicholas II himself) conspired to frame a Jewish clerk named Menachem Mendel Beilis for the \"ritual murder\" of a Ukrainian boy \u2014 a classic piece of blood libel anti-Semitism. The actual murderers (who were not Jews) were quickly discovered by police and journalists, but the authorities hushed it up.\nThe case attracted a storm of international condemnation, but the tsarist regime pressed on with the frame-up. The reason is that the frenzy of hatred served an important political function \u2014 namely, building mass popular support for the autocracy. (Luckily for Beilis, the prosecution's case was so shoddy that he was acquitted at trial.)\nSimilar to how war fever can inspire mass demonstrations of patriotic loyalty, stoking violent anti-Semitism (which produced clockwork bloody pogroms from reactionary \"Black Hundreds\" militias) provided both some social glue for a right-wing empire and a convenient scapegoat for any problems that cropped up. In the end, it didn't save Imperial Russia, but the truly enormous potential of political bigotry would later be demonstrated by Hitler and Nazi Germany.\nPolitical Islamophobia from Alaska to Australia serves as a key ideological unifier for modern right-wing movements, because they have little policy content which is practically useful for their mass base. Right-wing oligarchs like Trump may not actually roll back globalization, or do any major domestic policy but tax cuts and deregulation, but they can provide a compelling (and wholly fictional) narrative of white civilization under threat. White supremacist terrorism across the whole Western world is just the price to be paid.",

Did you know that he is the tallest municipal leader in any major American city? This is probably the only interesting fact about the mayor of New York, but he never gets any credit for it. It certainly doesn't help that both of his immediate predecessors have been iconic figures: The image of Michael Bloomberg as a soda-grabbing billionaire technocrat weirdo looms very large in the popular imagination, and Rudy Giuliani is a beloved right-wing meme. In his home state, de Blasio doesn't even win the superlative for being the most craven politician, an honor that belongs to the Democratic governor, Andrew &quot;Amazon&quot; Cuomo. Can someone please think up <a href=\"https://observer.com/2013/09/senator-provolone-doubles-down-on-pre-k-message/\">a memorable nickname</a> for him that is not a mild ethnic slur?</p>\n<p>De Blasio's reported <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/nyregion/bill-de-blasio-2020-mayor.html\">interest</a> in seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination is so pathetic that it makes the long-shot candidacy of his fellow mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, seem inspiring in comparison. All of this came into painfully sharp relief over the weekend when a whopping 20 people <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/03/17/de-blasio-speaks-to-crowd-of-only-20-people-in-new-hampshire/\">showed up</a> to see de Blasio appear at a roundtable on mental health in New Hampshire. Fourteen of them were invited members of the panel. If a politician gives a speech in an early primary state and no one hears it, did it really happen? Yes, but only because of the internet. When party kingmakers say that de Blasio is &quot;non-existent in Iowa,&quot; they mean it literally.</p>\n<p>There are obvious reasons for this. Outside of New York, de Blasio's political career would be utterly incomprehensible even to ordinary Democratic primary voters, among whom he enjoys the dubious <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-city-mayor-bill-de-blasio-possible-2020-bid-negative-favorability-2019-3\">distinction</a> of being the only would-be 2020 contender with a net negative favorability rating. Here is a Democrat who belongs to no recognizable national wing of his party. He is not a DSA-lite progressive or a Midwestern moderate or a centrist hawk. He is servitude to woke capital in human form, a man of the people who travels in a two-SUV convoy to work out at his old neighborhood gym every morning.</p>\n<p>Under de Blasio all of New York's much-lamented problems have gotten worse. Despite his verbal commitment to affordable housing it has never been more expensive to live in the city. Five years after the <a href=\"https://s.bsd.net/deblasio/default/page/-/One%20New%20York%2C%20Rising%20Together%20-%20Transit.pdf\">release</a> of &quot;Rising Together: The De Blasio Vision For New York City Transportation,&quot; the disgusting trash labyrinth that is the city's public transit system is less reliable than it was when he took office. The best way to tell that de Blasio doesn't care about something is if he makes noise about it. As a candidate he was a relentless critic of the New York Police Department; after being elected he promptly appointed Bill Bratton, who had held the job under Giuliani, as police commissioner. As far as I can tell his only real accomplishments in office are changing his mind in the most <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/amazon-new-york-bill-de-blasio.html\">baffling</a> and publicly humiliating manner possible about the erstwhile &quot;<a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2019/02/11/amazon-nyc-is-mission-critical-mayor-says.html\">mission critical</a>&quot; Amazon headquarters project and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/nyregion/regulation-of-circumcision-method-divides-some-jews-in-new-york.html\">harassing</a> the city's poor mohels. He also wants to <a href=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2018/12/20/de-blasio-endorses-legalizing-marijuana-in-nyc/\">legalize</a> dope.</p>\n<p>In the concrete jungle that is New York politics, de Blasio has the benefit of being the last bad choice for a narrow plurality of several million people whose views on a wide range of issues are out of step with those of the average American. There he is acceptable as someone who can pay lip service to various socially liberal causes while allowing developers to turn Manhattan into the odd combination of ghost town and luxury resort that it is today. Anywhere else he comes off as, well, exactly what he is: the least inspiring stooge for the donor class imaginable, a dream candidate for Republicans who would combine the woke posturing of a Beto O'Rourke with the sordid record of a Kamala Harris and the soaring oratory of a Tim Kaine. The world's smartest computer could not algorithmically generate a worse Democrat in 2020.</p>\n<p>President Trump really should encourage him.</p>",

He also wants to legalize dope.\nIn the concrete jungle that is New York politics, de Blasio has the benefit of being the last bad choice for a narrow plurality of several million people whose views on a wide range of issues are out of step with those of the average American. There he is acceptable as someone who can pay lip service to various socially liberal causes while allowing developers to turn Manhattan into the odd combination of ghost town and luxury resort that it is today. Anywhere else he comes off as, well, exactly what he is: the least inspiring stooge for the donor class imaginable, a dream candidate for Republicans who would combine the woke posturing of a Beto O'Rourke with the sordid record of a Kamala Harris and the soaring oratory of a Tim Kaine. The world's smartest computer could not algorithmically generate a worse Democrat in 2020.\nPresident Trump really should encourage him.",

(Photo credit: Jim Lo Scalzo-Pool/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>President Donald Trump and his Brazilian counterpart, President Jair Bolsonaro, were full of praise for each other during the latter&rsquo;s first visit to the White House on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He has done a very outstanding job,&rdquo; Trump said during an Oval Office press conference, before praising Bolsonaro for running &ldquo;one of the incredible campaigns.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Somebody said it a little bit reminded people of our campaign, which I&rsquo;m honored by,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro echoed those sentiments. &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure to be here in the United States, to take part in this visit, after decades on end of anti-U.S. presidents in Brazil,&rdquo; Bolsonaro said through a translator. &ldquo;We will certainly work toward the benefit of our two nations. Just as [Trump] wants to have a &lsquo;great&rsquo; America, I&hellip;also want to make sure we have a great Brazil.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>The Brazilian president also spoke warmly of Trump the night prior, in an interview with the conservative-leaning Fox News.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have a great deal in common,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been highly criticized because of this but I will not, of course, deny what I do think. &hellip; I&rsquo;m willing to open my heart up to him, and do whatever is to the benefit of both the Brazilian and the Americans.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The friendly relationship between the pair is perhaps unsurprising, bearing in mind the similarities in both their policies and often vitriolic rhetoric, most notably in relation to their ideas on crime and policing.</p>\n<p>Both Bolsonaro and Trump have styled themselves as law-and-order leaders who have promised to crack down on crime. In Bolsonaro&rsquo;s case, this is a much more pressing issue: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/world/americas/brazil-murder-rate-record.html\">Brazil suffered nearly 64,000 murders in 2017</a>, a record number which increased the country&rsquo;s murder rate to 30.8 per 100,000 people.</p>\n<p>By comparison, the number of murders in the United States in 2015 (the most recent year data is available) was approximately five per 100,000 people. This, however, has not stopped Trump from repeatedly fear-mongering about crime in the United States, particularly when it comes to immigration.</p>\n<p>Whereas most of Trump&rsquo;s most aggressive &ldquo;law-and-order&rdquo; ideas have been limited to his speeches &mdash; like asking cops to rough up more suspects during an address to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/28/16059536/trump-cops-speech-gang-violence-long-island\">police officers in 2017</a> &mdash; the shocking murder rate Brazil is experiencing has given Bolsonaro political leeway to pursue a violent crime crackdown.</p>\n<p>Over the past three months, police in Rio de Janeiro have <a href=\"https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/bolsonaros-crime-crackdown-sparks-rise-in-police-killings/93089\">averaged more than three killings a day</a>, and residents in some of Brazil&rsquo;s favelas have accused the police of brutality, including <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/year-marielle-franco-murder-violence-haunts-rio-190313013959993.html\">waging unauthorized sniper campaigns</a> and firing indiscriminately from a helicopter.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s embrace of fiery populist rhetoric has also frequently boiled over to galvanize supporters into acts of violence, specifically targeted at opposition supporters and the media.</p>\n<p>During the Brazilian election last November, the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/10/26/18022864/brazil-presidential-election-bolsonaro-haddad\">documented</a> more than 140 cases of violence against reporters, mostly by Bolsonaro supporters. Trump has embraced a similar rhetoric, which has at times caused his supporters to lash out against the media, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/florida-man-arrested-for-botched-mail-bombing-attempts-96cd922bf306/\">most notably in the case of Cesar Sayoc</a>, a Trump supporter who allegedly sent a dozen pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and CNN&rsquo;s offices in New York City. More recently, at a rally in El Paso last month, a Trump supporter <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47208909\">attacked</a> a BBC cameraman and several other news crews before being dragged away by security.</p>\n<p>Both men also share a severe disdain for minority groups. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint nonwhite immigrants &mdash; specifically those from Mexico and Central America &mdash; as violent criminals, despite <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-border-fear-mongering-is-far-from-reality-26ed4da50603/\">multiple studies showing</a> undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how bad these people are,&rdquo; he said last May, referring to undocumented immigrants. &ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t people. These are animals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Trump also implemented a ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, notoriously calling on the campaign trail for a &ldquo;total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country&rsquo;s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro holds near-identical views. On Monday night, he told Fox News that he supports Trump&rsquo;s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall because &ldquo;the vast majority of potential immigrants do not have good intentions.&rdquo; In that same interview he also castigated France for its open border policy, which he claimed had made parts of the country &ldquo;unlivable.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CG99qZZh5bA?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Both Trump and Bolsonaro have also targeted vulnerable communities within their countries.</p>\n<p>On his first day in office, the Brazilian president issued several executive orders, one of which prohibited new lands from being set aside for indigenous communities or &ldquo;Quilombolas,&rdquo; the descendants of former slaves. He also issued an order granting the Agriculture Ministry, rather than the National Indian Foundation, power to certify those indigenous territories, a move which will likely leave many uncertified regions unprotected and open to farming, logging, and mining.</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro also took immediate action against the LGBTQ community by stripping the human rights ministry of any authority over discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Bolsonaro has also said on several occasions that he would prefer a dead son over a gay son.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has similarly argued in court that discrimination against LGBTQ people should be legal, banned transgender people from serving in the military, and is considering erasing transgender people from the federal government.</p>\n<p>In a second press conference in the Rose Garden Tuesday, Bolsonaro praised Trump&rsquo;s crackdown and said he planned to repeat those efforts within his own government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Brazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberties in respect to traditional family lifestyle, respect to God, our creator against gender ideology or politically correct attitude and against fake news,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Drawing inspiration from Ronald Reagan, I wish to bring his administration style to Brazil.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to being a climate denier, Bolsonaro has also suggested he is willing to destroy the Amazon rainforest for financial gain and believes indigenous groups living there should be forcibly assimilated. Trump, too, has repeatedly questioned the origins of human-caused climate change, despite overwhelming <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/minutes/145615/republican-senator-nasa-disputes-climate-consensus-nasa-no-dont\">scientific evidence</a> on the subject from his own administration.</p>\n<p>Trump and Bolsonaro share another notable similarity: both men are facing creeping political scandals that have stymied their presidencies.</p>\n<p>During his Fox News interview on Monday, Bolsonaro was forced to deny that he or his family were in any way linked to the murder of Marielle Franco, a prominent leftist politician who was gunned down in Rio de Janeiro last year. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is bracing for the imminent release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s report, which is expected to outline allegations of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.</p>\n<p>Despite this, Bolsonaro said Tuesday that he was confident Trump would be reelected in 2020.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020. But I do believe Donald Trump will be re-elected fully,&rdquo; he said.</p>",

Just as [Trump] wants to have a \u2018great\u2019 America, I\u2026also want to make sure we have a great Brazil.\u201d\nThe Brazilian president also spoke warmly of Trump the night prior, in an interview with the conservative-leaning Fox News.\n\u201cWe have a great deal in common,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been highly criticized because of this but I will not, of course, deny what I do think. \u2026 I\u2019m willing to open my heart up to him, and do whatever is to the benefit of both the Brazilian and the Americans.\u201d\nThe friendly relationship between the pair is perhaps unsurprising, bearing in mind the similarities in both their policies and often vitriolic rhetoric, most notably in relation to their ideas on crime and policing.\nBoth Bolsonaro and Trump have styled themselves as law-and-order leaders who have promised to crack down on crime. In Bolsonaro\u2019s case, this is a much more pressing issue: Brazil suffered nearly 64,000 murders in 2017, a record number which increased the country\u2019s murder rate to 30.8 per 100,000 people.\nBy comparison, the number of murders in the United States in 2015 (the most recent year data is available) was approximately five per 100,000 people. This, however, has not stopped Trump from repeatedly fear-mongering about crime in the United States, particularly when it comes to immigration.\nWhereas most of Trump\u2019s most aggressive \u201claw-and-order\u201d ideas have been limited to his speeches \u2014 like asking cops to rough up more suspects during an address to police officers in 2017 \u2014 the shocking murder rate Brazil is experiencing has given Bolsonaro political leeway to pursue a violent crime crackdown.\nOver the past three months, police in Rio de Janeiro have averaged more than three killings a day, and residents in some of Brazil\u2019s favelas have accused the police of brutality, including waging unauthorized sniper campaigns and firing indiscriminately from a helicopter.\nBolsonaro\u2019s embrace of fiery populist rhetoric has also frequently boiled over to galvanize supporters into acts of violence, specifically targeted at opposition supporters and the media.\nDuring the Brazilian election last November, the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism documented more than 140 cases of violence against reporters, mostly by Bolsonaro supporters. Trump has embraced a similar rhetoric, which has at times caused his supporters to lash out against the media, most notably in the case of Cesar Sayoc, a Trump supporter who allegedly sent a dozen pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and CNN\u2019s offices in New York City. More recently, at a rally in El Paso last month, a Trump supporter attacked a BBC cameraman and several other news crews before being dragged away by security.\nBoth men also share a severe disdain for minority groups. Trump has repeatedly sought to paint nonwhite immigrants \u2014 specifically those from Mexico and Central America \u2014 as violent criminals, despite multiple studies showing undocumented immigrants commit crimes at a far lower rate than U.S. citizens.\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how bad these people are,\u201d he said last May, referring to undocumented immigrants. \u201cThese aren\u2019t people. These are animals.\u201d\nTrump also implemented a ban on travel from Muslim-majority countries, notoriously calling on the campaign trail for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\u2019s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\u201d\nBolsonaro holds near-identical views. On Monday night, he told Fox News that he supports Trump\u2019s proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall because \u201cthe vast majority of potential immigrants do not have good intentions.\u201d In that same interview he also castigated France for its open border policy, which he claimed had made parts of the country \u201cunlivable.\u201d\nBoth Trump and Bolsonaro have also targeted vulnerable communities within their countries.\nOn his first day in office, the Brazilian president issued several executive orders, one of which prohibited new lands from being set aside for indigenous communities or \u201cQuilombolas,\u201d the descendants of former slaves. He also issued an order granting the Agriculture Ministry, rather than the National Indian Foundation, power to certify those indigenous territories, a move which will likely leave many uncertified regions unprotected and open to farming, logging, and mining.\nBolsonaro also took immediate action against the LGBTQ community by stripping the human rights ministry of any authority over discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Bolsonaro has also said on several occasions that he would prefer a dead son over a gay son.\nThe Trump administration has similarly argued in court that discrimination against LGBTQ people should be legal, banned transgender people from serving in the military, and is considering erasing transgender people from the federal government.\nIn a second press conference in the Rose Garden Tuesday, Bolsonaro praised Trump\u2019s crackdown and said he planned to repeat those efforts within his own government.\n\u201cBrazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberties in respect to traditional family lifestyle, respect to God, our creator against gender ideology or politically correct attitude and against fake news,\u201d he said. \u201cDrawing inspiration from Ronald Reagan, I wish to bring his administration style to Brazil.\u201d\nIn addition to being a climate denier, Bolsonaro has also suggested he is willing to destroy the Amazon rainforest for financial gain and believes indigenous groups living there should be forcibly assimilated. Trump, too, has repeatedly questioned the origins of human-caused climate change, despite overwhelming scientific evidence on the subject from his own administration.\nTrump and Bolsonaro share another notable similarity: both men are facing creeping political scandals that have stymied their presidencies.\nDuring his Fox News interview on Monday, Bolsonaro was forced to deny that he or his family were in any way linked to the murder of Marielle Franco, a prominent leftist politician who was gunned down in Rio de Janeiro last year. The Trump administration, meanwhile, is bracing for the imminent release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, which is expected to outline allegations of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\nDespite this, Bolsonaro said Tuesday that he was confident Trump would be reelected in 2020.\n\u201cWe will respect whatever the ballots tell us on 2020. But I do believe Donald Trump will be re-elected fully,\u201d he said.",

(Photo credit: PATRICK ANIDJAR/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Far right agitators and conspiracy theorists have seized on Monday&rsquo;s horrific fire at the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, using the tragedy to push baseless conspiracies about the end of &ldquo;western civilization.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Leaders around the globe have referred to the fire, which likely began as an accident, as a significant loss to world culture and French history. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the building as a &ldquo;treasure,&rdquo; while other world leaders &mdash; including the Pope &mdash; mourned its partial destruction.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[Notre Dame is] an architectural jewel of a collective memory,&rdquo; he said, noting its significance to Catholics around the world.</p>\n<p>Some on the far right, however, are using the incident to push baseless conspiracies, including claims that the fire was the result of arson<a href=\"https://twitter.com/travis_view/status/1118213158395531264\">,</a> and that it further represented the decline of &ldquo;western civilization.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>The latter is a recurring theme on the far right, and one of its least accurate, historically speaking.</p>\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of the fire, for example, white supremacist Richard Spencer tweeted that the tragedy may have been worth it if it spurred &ldquo;the White man into action &mdash; to seize power in his countries, in Europe, in the world.&rdquo; Far-right Rep. Steve King (R-IA), a white nationalist himself, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKingIA/status/1118164498244866048\">tweeted</a> that the cathedral was &ldquo;priceless to all of Christianity and all of the West.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-shep-smith-neil-cavuto-shut-down-notre-dame-fire-conspiracy-theories/?via=twitter_page\">The Daily Beast</a> noted, two separate Fox News guests on Monday speculated that the fire might have been caused on purpose, though both guests were immediately shut down by hosts Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto.</p>\n<p>And on the virulently Islamophobic website Jihad Watch, one columnist wrote that police in Paris had foiled a terror plot involving a young Muslim woman near the cathedral. The incident in the article, which quickly gained traction on Facebook, was actually from 2016. A disclaimer stating &ldquo;this post is not about the fire at Notre Dame&rdquo; was only available after users clicked through the link to the story. Other Islamophobes began widely circulating <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1117964249064775681\">a video</a> of the fire at Notre Dame overlaid with unrelated audio of people shouting &ldquo;Allahu Akbar,&rdquo; before YouTube, Twitter, and other platforms removed it from their platforms.</p>\n<p>Key to each of those examples is the idea that &ldquo;western civilization,&rdquo; represented by the iconic Notre Dame, is under attack from non-&ldquo;western&rdquo; individuals or forces and echoes many conspiracies propagated by white nationalists.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, King was stripped of his House committee assignments for asking in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/steve-king-trump-immigration-wall.html\">New York Times</a> interview when terms like &ldquo;white nationalist, white supremacist, [and] western civilization&rdquo; became offensive. The far-right Proud Boys gang requires members to state in their initiation that they are a &ldquo;Western Chauvinist and &hellip; refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There is no evidence, of course, to suggest that the Notre Dame fire was anything more than a tragic accident. Experts also say the notion that Notre Dame&rsquo;s destruction represents some sort of attack on western civilization ignores France&rsquo;s diverse history, presenting it instead as homogenous, Christian, and white.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[The far-right emphasis on &lsquo;western culture&rsquo;] is not using the past for the past&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Matt Gabriele, professor of Medieval Studies and chair of the Religion and Culture department at Virginia Tech. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s using the past to mobilize a political argument that doesn&rsquo;t care about historical accuracy but about what the emotional response is and the evocation that generates.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Europe has never been homogeneously white, we have architectural and contextual evidence of people from all over the place in Europe for the Middle Ages, the late Roman period and continuously through them,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The idea that Europe was a homogeneously white space is weaponized nostalgia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Suleiman Mourad, a religion professor at Smith College, specifically called out the far right&rsquo;s baseless fear-mongering about the cathedral fire on Tuesday. &ldquo;They want to legitimize their discourse by referring to the past, to make their political claims more convincing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mourad also noted that the the idea of &ldquo;western culture&rdquo; as a single, monolithic entity did not exist until well into the 18th and 19th centuries, when academia started using it as justification for colonization and colonial expansion.</p>\n<p>Cord J. Whitaker, an English professor at Wellesley College specializing in Medieval literature, added that many of the improvements in Medieval European architecture which helped create Notre Dame would not have been possible without exchanges between European architects and Islamic architects. The racist and Islamophobic discourse surrounding the far-right&rsquo;s discussion of Notre Dame, he said, misses the point.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Many people see that building as a symbol of care and sanctuary for all people, regardless of faith or culture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To that extent I do think it should be a global project to take care of it &mdash; we run into problems when it becomes viewed only as a sign of western culture or European culture, [language] that feeds this fear-mongering discourse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>This post has been updated with the correct spelling of Professor Matthew Gabriele&rsquo;s name. </em></p>",

                "text": "Far right agitators and conspiracy theorists have seized on Monday\u2019s horrific fire at the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, using the tragedy to push baseless conspiracies about the end of \u201cwestern civilization.\u201d\nLeaders around the globe have referred to the fire, which likely began as an accident, as a significant loss to world culture and French history. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin referred to the building as a \u201ctreasure,\u201d while other world leaders \u2014 including the Pope \u2014 mourned its partial destruction.\n\u201c[Notre Dame is] an architectural jewel of a collective memory,\u201d he said, noting its significance to Catholics around the world.\nSome on the far right, however, are using the incident to push baseless conspiracies, including claims that the fire was the result of arson, and that it further represented the decline of \u201cwestern civilization.\u201d\nThe latter is a recurring theme on the far right, and one of its least accurate, historically speaking.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fire, for example, white supremacist Richard Spencer tweeted that the tragedy may have been worth it if it spurred \u201cthe White man into action \u2014 to seize power in his countries, in Europe, in the world.\u201d Far-right Rep. Steve King (R-IA), a white nationalist himself, tweeted that the cathedral was \u201cpriceless to all of Christianity and all of the West.\u201d\nAs The Daily Beast noted, two separate Fox News guests on Monday speculated that the fire might have been caused on purpose, though both guests were immediately shut down by hosts Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto.\nAnd on the virulently Islamophobic website Jihad Watch, one columnist wrote that police in Paris had foiled a terror plot involving a young Muslim woman near the cathedral. The incident in the article, which quickly gained traction on Facebook, was actually from 2016. A disclaimer stating \u201cthis post is not about the fire at Notre Dame\u201d was only available after users clicked through the link to the story. Other Islamophobes began widely circulating a video of the fire at Notre Dame overlaid with unrelated audio of people shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d before YouTube, Twitter, and other platforms removed it from their platforms.\nKey to each of those examples is the idea that \u201cwestern civilization,\u201d represented by the iconic Notre Dame, is under attack from non-\u201cwestern\u201d individuals or forces and echoes many conspiracies propagated by white nationalists.\nEarlier this year, King was stripped of his House committee assignments for asking in a New York Times interview when terms like \u201cwhite nationalist, white supremacist, [and] western civilization\u201d became offensive. The far-right Proud Boys gang requires members to state in their initiation that they are a \u201cWestern Chauvinist and \u2026 refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.\u201d\nThere is no evidence, of course, to suggest that the Notre Dame fire was anything more than a tragic accident. Experts also say the notion that Notre Dame\u2019s destruction represents some sort of attack on western civilization ignores France\u2019s diverse history, presenting it instead as homogenous, Christian, and white.\n\u201c[The far-right emphasis on \u2018western culture\u2019] is not using the past for the past\u2019s sake,\u201d said Matt Gabriele, professor of Medieval Studies and chair of the Religion and Culture department at Virginia Tech. \u201cIt\u2019s using the past to mobilize a political argument that doesn\u2019t care about historical accuracy but about what the emotional response is and the evocation that generates.\u201d\n\u201cEurope has never been homogeneously white, we have architectural and contextual evidence of people from all over the place in Europe for the Middle Ages, the late Roman period and continuously through them,\u201d he added. \u201cThe idea that Europe was a homogeneously white space is weaponized nostalgia.\u201d\nSuleiman Mourad, a religion professor at Smith College, specifically called out the far right\u2019s baseless fear-mongering about the cathedral fire on Tuesday. \u201cThey want to legitimize their discourse by referring to the past, to make their political claims more convincing.\u201d\nMourad also noted that the the idea of \u201cwestern culture\u201d as a single, monolithic entity did not exist until well into the 18th and 19th centuries, when academia started using it as justification for colonization and colonial expansion.\nCord J. Whitaker, an English professor at Wellesley College specializing in Medieval literature, added that many of the improvements in Medieval European architecture which helped create Notre Dame would not have been possible without exchanges between European architects and Islamic architects. The racist and Islamophobic discourse surrounding the far-right\u2019s discussion of Notre Dame, he said, misses the point.\n\u201cMany people see that building as a symbol of care and sanctuary for all people, regardless of faith or culture,\u201d he said. \u201cTo that extent I do think it should be a global project to take care of it \u2014 we run into problems when it becomes viewed only as a sign of western culture or European culture, [language] that feeds this fear-mongering discourse.\u201d\nThis post has been updated with the correct spelling of Professor Matthew Gabriele\u2019s name.",

(Photo by Karen Ducey/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>On Wednesday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) will introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019, and already more than 100 House Democrats have said they support the bill.</p>\n<p>ThinkProgress reviewed a section-by-section summary of the bill and participated in two press calls with the congresswoman and her staff. Jayapal&rsquo;s plan is likely the most ambitious yet among the crowded list of Democratic universal-coverage proposals.</p>\n<p>The plan would fundamentally reshape the health care system by moving millions of Americans who get insurance through employers into a single-payer plan within two years. The bill builds upon the original single-payer plans in the House, sponsored by former Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), and Senate, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is time to put health over profit and we have a plan &mdash; we have a real plan and that plan is the Medicare for All Act of 2019,&rdquo; Jayapal said at a press conference on Tuesday. &ldquo;This Medicare for All bill really makes it clear what we mean when we say &lsquo;Medicare for All.&rsquo; &hellip; We believe that the market is broken and that is the core idea here we are trying to fix.&rdquo;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>Jayapal staff called the bill the &ldquo;gold standard Medicare for All proposal,&rdquo; describing it as a single-payer plan that covers everyone and offers comprehensive benefits, including long-term care services, which have been left out of past proposals.</p>\n<figure> <picture data-id=\"1124127\"\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C483px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 512px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=512&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C322px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C483px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"all\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\"></source><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C489px&ssl=1\" srcset=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-26-at-2.38.31-PM.png?w=778&h=489&crop=1\"></img></picture></figure>\n<p>There would be no premiums, deductibles, co-pays, or other out-of-pocket costs &mdash; a provision that goes further than Sanders&rsquo; plan, which allows the government to charge for some prescription drugs but caps it at $200 per year.</p>\n<p>Like Conyers&rsquo; bill, Jayapal&rsquo;s would eliminate virtually all private insurance, solely permitting coverage that complements, but does not duplicate benefits offered in the Medicare for All program. The Veterans Affairs&rsquo; health system and the Indian Health Services (IHS) also remain untouched.</p>\n<p>But the Jayapal bill goes further, for example, by covering abortion services and by repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans any federal insurance program from covering abortion.</p>\n<p>Medicare for All is the rallying cry for progressives, and has even garnered mainstream support, including from 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. This means the Jayapal proposal could easily be the health policy Democrats consider when they take back the White House.</p>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say the bill is ready for legislative prime time. It hasn&rsquo;t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, nor is staff expecting this to happen any time soon. Furthermore, staff members haven&rsquo;t decided how the bill would <em>actually</em> pass &mdash; whether through reconciliation or through a 60-vote majority in the Senate. The bill also doesn&rsquo;t include how the plan is going to be financed. Staff did emphasize that it&rsquo;s impossible to imagine a system more expensive than the current one, but added that they are contemplating progressive tax proposals, like increasing marginal tax rates. This is why Jayapal called for House hearings, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-plan-to-hold-hearings-on-medicare-for-all/2019/01/03/7051eccc-0f6c-11e9-84fc-d58c33d6c8c7_story.html?utm_term=.61b90763340f\">even secured hearings</a> in the Rules and Budget committees in March, for further input.</p>\n<h2>What sets Jayapal&rsquo;s Medicare for All bill apart?</h2>\n<p>The Jayapal bill implements a national health insurance program over a two-year period; alternatively, the Conyers and Sanders bills provide one and four years, respectively. Administrative changes are primarily done within the first year, and by the end of the second year and into the third, all U.S. residents &mdash; a criteria set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary &mdash; will be covered by the Medicare for All program.</p>\n<p>The bill also creates a Medicare Transition buy-in plan during the two-year period, which will be offered on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. The plan&rsquo;s benefits will be the same benefits available under the Medicare for All program.</p>\n<p>Staff said there&rsquo;s growing evidence to suggest a faster transition period is necessary, specifically citing <a href=\"https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/1127-economic-analysis-of-medicare-for-all\">a recent study</a> from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The thinking is that as the federal government radically reforms the system, insurance companies may exit existing marketplaces, leaving patients without plans or increasing premiums. This means a Medicare for All program would need to be implemented as quickly as possible. Advocates with the Center for Popular Democracy told ThinkProgress in January they were pushing for a faster transition period because they wanted the president who signs the Medicare for All bill into law to be the one who oversees implementation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the bill uses existing policy ideas to tackle prescription drug costs and health care spending. Specifically, the proposal adapts ideas from a bill <a href=\"https://doggett.house.gov/media-center/in-the-news/hill-democrats-have-medicare-negotiation-plan-terrifies-big-pharma\">introduced by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX)</a> that allows Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices but sidesteps pharmaceutical companies by issuing competitive licenses when they refuse to offer a reasonable price.</p>\n<p>The bill also creates a global budget program to pay &ldquo;institutional providers&rdquo; and contain costs. This means providers like hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes will be paid a lump sum global operating budget on a quarterly basis to provide covered benefits. Jayapal&rsquo;s staff cited Maryland as an example of how this could work; <a href=\"https://innovation.cms.gov/Files/reports/md-all-payer-secondannrpt.pdf\">early results from a federal analysis</a> of Maryland&rsquo;s global budget program for hospitals show it reduced total expenditures and total hospital expenditures &ldquo;without shifting costs to other parts of the health care system outside of global budgets.&rdquo; Providers who work in non-institutional settings &mdash; which staff suspects to be &ldquo;a narrow group of people&rdquo; &mdash; will be paid on a fee-for-service basis. The HHS secretary will set a national fee schedule within a year of enactment.</p>\n<p>Staff also emphasized that the bill strives to do better on long-term care, as many disability advocates were critical of past Medicare for All proposals. The bill covers long-term care without cost-sharing and diverges from Medicaid by prioritizing home and community based services over institutional care.</p>\n<p>Jayapal is really excited about the long-term care provisions, as her staff worked closely with disability rights organizations and individual advocates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Long term care in this country is a deeply forgotten, left behind issue and it has such urgency,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The people who have disabilities, need care, seniors, and when you think about the workforce that is essentially paying the cost of this right now &mdash; the unpaid workforce is largely female of caregivers and often a lot of people of color.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The bill also addresses the increasing costs of prescription drugs, requiring the HHS secretary to establish a prescription drug formulary that promotes the use of generic medications and &ldquo;to promulgate rules on using off-formulary medications and [allow] clinicians and patients to petition to add or remove medications from the formulary,&rdquo; according the bill summary. Staff said the bill will require a public consultation process with representatives, including people with disabilities, when the secretary promulgates rules to ensure medications for specific populations are covered.</p>\n<p>The HHS secretary has some discretion, per the summary, but staff emphasized that the bill&rsquo;s intent is clear. An administration with a different ideology couldn&rsquo;t take away benefits, but states could add benefits or cover U.S. residents not already covered in the Medicare for All program.</p>",

                "text": "On Wednesday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) will introduce the Medicare for All Act of 2019, and already more than 100 House Democrats have said they support the bill.\nThinkProgress reviewed a section-by-section summary of the bill and participated in two press calls with the congresswoman and her staff. Jayapal\u2019s plan is likely the most ambitious yet among the crowded list of Democratic universal-coverage proposals.\nThe plan would fundamentally reshape the health care system by moving millions of Americans who get insurance through employers into a single-payer plan within two years. The bill builds upon the original single-payer plans in the House, sponsored by former Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), and Senate, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\u201cIt is time to put health over profit and we have a plan \u2014 we have a real plan and that plan is the Medicare for All Act of 2019,\u201d Jayapal said at a press conference on Tuesday. \u201cThis Medicare for All bill really makes it clear what we mean when we say \u2018Medicare for All.\u2019 \u2026 We believe that the market is broken and that is the core idea here we are trying to fix.\u201d\nJayapal staff called the bill the \u201cgold standard Medicare for All proposal,\u201d describing it as a single-payer plan that covers everyone and offers comprehensive benefits, including long-term care services, which have been left out of past proposals.\nThere would be no premiums, deductibles, co-pays, or other out-of-pocket costs \u2014 a provision that goes further than Sanders\u2019 plan, which allows the government to charge for some prescription drugs but caps it at $200 per year.\nLike Conyers\u2019 bill, Jayapal\u2019s would eliminate virtually all private insurance, solely permitting coverage that complements, but does not duplicate benefits offered in the Medicare for All program. The Veterans Affairs\u2019 health system and the Indian Health Services (IHS) also remain untouched.\nBut the Jayapal bill goes further, for example, by covering abortion services and by repealing the Hyde Amendment, which bans any federal insurance program from covering abortion.\nMedicare for All is the rallying cry for progressives, and has even garnered mainstream support, including from 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. This means the Jayapal proposal could easily be the health policy Democrats consider when they take back the White House.\nThis isn\u2019t to say the bill is ready for legislative prime time. It hasn\u2019t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, nor is staff expecting this to happen any time soon. Furthermore, staff members haven\u2019t decided how the bill would actually pass \u2014 whether through reconciliation or through a 60-vote majority in the Senate. The bill also doesn\u2019t include how the plan is going to be financed. Staff did emphasize that it\u2019s impossible to imagine a system more expensive than the current one, but added that they are contemplating progressive tax proposals, like increasing marginal tax rates. This is why Jayapal called for House hearings, and even secured hearings in the Rules and Budget committees in March, for further input.\nWhat sets Jayapal\u2019s Medicare for All bill apart?\nThe Jayapal bill implements a national health insurance program over a two-year period; alternatively, the Conyers and Sanders bills provide one and four years, respectively. Administrative changes are primarily done within the first year, and by the end of the second year and into the third, all U.S. residents \u2014 a criteria set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary \u2014 will be covered by the Medicare for All program.\nThe bill also creates a Medicare Transition buy-in plan during the two-year period, which will be offered on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces. The plan\u2019s benefits will be the same benefits available under the Medicare for All program.\nStaff said there\u2019s growing evidence to suggest a faster transition period is necessary, specifically citing a recent study from the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. The thinking is that as the federal government radically reforms the system, insurance companies may exit existing marketplaces, leaving patients without plans or increasing premiums. This means a Medicare for All program would need to be implemented as quickly as possible. Advocates with the Center for Popular Democracy told ThinkProgress in January they were pushing for a faster transition period because they wanted the president who signs the Medicare for All bill into law to be the one who oversees implementation.\nAdditionally, the bill uses existing policy ideas to tackle prescription drug costs and health care spending. Specifically, the proposal adapts ideas from a bill introduced by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) that allows Medicare to directly negotiate drug prices but sidesteps pharmaceutical companies by issuing competitive licenses when they refuse to offer a reasonable price.\nThe bill also creates a global budget program to pay \u201cinstitutional providers\u201d and contain costs. This means providers like hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes will be paid a lump sum global operating budget on a quarterly basis to provide covered benefits. Jayapal\u2019s staff cited Maryland as an example of how this could work; early results from a federal analysis of Maryland\u2019s global budget program for hospitals show it reduced total expenditures and total hospital expenditures \u201cwithout shifting costs to other parts of the health care system outside of global budgets.\u201d Providers who work in non-institutional settings \u2014 which staff suspects to be \u201ca narrow group of people\u201d \u2014 will be paid on a fee-for-service basis. The HHS secretary will set a national fee schedule within a year of enactment.\nStaff also emphasized that the bill strives to do better on long-term care, as many disability advocates were critical of past Medicare for All proposals. The bill covers long-term care without cost-sharing and diverges from Medicaid by prioritizing home and community based services over institutional care.\nJayapal is really excited about the long-term care provisions, as her staff worked closely with disability rights organizations and individual advocates.\n\u201cLong term care in this country is a deeply forgotten, left behind issue and it has such urgency,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who have disabilities, need care, seniors, and when you think about the workforce that is essentially paying the cost of this right now \u2014 the unpaid workforce is largely female of caregivers and often a lot of people of color.\u201d\nThe bill also addresses the increasing costs of prescription drugs, requiring the HHS secretary to establish a prescription drug formulary that promotes the use of generic medications and \u201cto promulgate rules on using off-formulary medications and [allow] clinicians and patients to petition to add or remove medications from the formulary,\u201d according the bill summary. Staff said the bill will require a public consultation process with representatives, including people with disabilities, when the secretary promulgates rules to ensure medications for specific populations are covered.\nThe HHS secretary has some discretion, per the summary, but staff emphasized that the bill\u2019s intent is clear. An administration with a different ideology couldn\u2019t take away benefits, but states could add benefits or cover U.S. residents not already covered in the Medicare for All program.",

Climate change and inequality pose dire threats to working people, to all that we love about Maine and to our democracy. The work of moving towards a renewable economy must be rooted in workers&rsquo; rights and economic and social justice,&rdquo; Matt Schlobohm, executive director of the Maine AFL-CIO, said in a statement, emphasizing the need for workers and unions to &ldquo;have a seat at the table in crafting bold climate protection policies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This endorsement comes after members of the national arm of AFL-CIO&rsquo;s Energy Committee, the country&rsquo;s largest union federation, criticized the federal Green New Deal resolution proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/afl-cio-criticizes-green-new-deal-calling-it-not-achievable-or-realistic/2019/03/12/842784fe-44dd-11e9-aaf8-4512a6fe3439_story.html?utm_term=.4a7dfc077c3b\">calling it</a> &ldquo;not achievable or realistic.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>Millennial state Rep. Chloe Maxmin (D), who was endorsed by the youth-led Sunrise Movement during the 2018 midterm elections, first introduced the &ldquo;Act to Establish a Green New Deal for Maine&rdquo; in March.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.mainegnd.com\">legislation</a> would require Maine reach 80% renewable electricity by 2040, provide solar power to schools, set up a task force for job and economic growth, and guarantee a just transition in the shift towards a low-carbon economy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From the very first conversation that we had&hellip; labor was involved,&rdquo; Maxmin said. For the past year, Maxmin has been speaking with constituents who voiced a &ldquo;deep need for economic growth,&rdquo; she said, noting that this bill is &ldquo;very specific to Maine and rooted in rural and working communities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The goal, she said, was to &ldquo;bring in voices that are traditionally not part of this conversation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In a statement to ThinkProgress, Sunrise executive director Varshini Prakash celebrated labor unions&rsquo; support for the state initiative, calling the broader idea of a Green New Deal &ldquo;America&rsquo;s biggest union job creation program in a century.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Across the country, states and cities are seizing on the interest generated by the Green New Deal and introducing their own ambitious climate proposals. The federal version &mdash; currently a resolution, not a piece of legislation &mdash; calls for meeting 100% of the country&rsquo;s power demand with renewable, emissions-free sources in around a decade, all while using the transition to create jobs and enshrine social justice principles, like equal access to education and universal health care.</p>\n<p>Local level efforts vary in their focus and ambition. Often, initiatives are exclusive to the power sector; as of last month, at least 19 states are considering or have already set 100% clean or renewable electricity targets. But others are working to capture the full spirit of a Green New Deal &mdash; which means incorporating social justice tenets into the plan.</p>\n<p>Last week, Minnesota introduced its own Green New Deal bill built on close collaboration between youth activists and state lawmakers. Officials and activists in New Mexico, New York, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, as well as the city of Los Angeles, have all used Green New Deal language to frame and market their clean energy and climate initiatives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/minnesota-green-new-deal-youth-activism-cities-states-trump-f6e8a0b23086/\"><figure> <picture data-id=\"1132706\"\"><source media=\"(min-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=1920&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1277px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1920px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=1920&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C1277px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C681px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 1024px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=1024&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C681px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(min-width: 512px) and (max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C511px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 512px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=512&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C341px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"(max-width: 768px)\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=768&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C511px&ssl=1\"></source><source media=\"all\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/GettyImages-1090970884.jpg?w=6048&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C4024px&ssl=1\"></source><img alt=\"Pedestrians brave the cold to go for a walk on the Stone Arch Bridge on January 29, 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

As the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned last fall, without dramatic change to cut greenhouse gasses, global emissions are set to rise to a level that would usher in catastrophic consequences in just over a decade.</p>\n<p>In Maine, global warming of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures means more flooding along the coasts and inland, as well as increased drought and extreme heat. Scientists have found that the Gulf of Maine is already warming faster than 99% of the world&rsquo;s oceans, disrupting fishery patters and, in turn, the fishing industry.</p>\n<p>Next week, lawmakers will hold a public hearing for Maine&rsquo;s Green New Deal bill. A few weeks later, it will be put up for committee vote. And Maxmin thinks there&rsquo;s a good chance the bill will pass.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It has a name that is drawing attention to it &hellip; [and it&rsquo;s] really bringing people from so many backgrounds together,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it has a really good chance because it&rsquo;s basically an economic and job growth strategy for Maine.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/782-Gq0CzxM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><em>This article has been updated to clarify that it was members of the AFL-CIO&rsquo;s Energy Committee that criticized the federal Green New Deal resolution.</em></p>",

                "text": "The Maine American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), which represents over 160 local labor unions across the state, announced its support Tuesday for the state\u2019s recently introduced Green New Deal legislation.\nThis is the first Green New Deal-branded proposal to be backed by a state AFL affiliate.\n\u201cWe face twin crises of skyrocketing inequality and increasing climate instability. Climate change and inequality pose dire threats to working people, to all that we love about Maine and to our democracy. The work of moving towards a renewable economy must be rooted in workers\u2019 rights and economic and social justice,\u201d Matt Schlobohm, executive director of the Maine AFL-CIO, said in a statement, emphasizing the need for workers and unions to \u201chave a seat at the table in crafting bold climate protection policies.\u201d\nThis endorsement comes after members of the national arm of AFL-CIO\u2019s Energy Committee, the country\u2019s largest union federation, criticized the federal Green New Deal resolution proposed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), calling it \u201cnot achievable or realistic.\u201d\nMillennial state Rep. Chloe Maxmin (D), who was endorsed by the youth-led Sunrise Movement during the 2018 midterm elections, first introduced the \u201cAct to Establish a Green New Deal for Maine\u201d in March.\nThe legislation would require Maine reach 80% renewable electricity by 2040, provide solar power to schools, set up a task force for job and economic growth, and guarantee a just transition in the shift towards a low-carbon economy.\n\u201cFrom the very first conversation that we had\u2026 labor was involved,\u201d Maxmin said. For the past year, Maxmin has been speaking with constituents who voiced a \u201cdeep need for economic growth,\u201d she said, noting that this bill is \u201cvery specific to Maine and rooted in rural and working communities.\u201d\nThe goal, she said, was to \u201cbring in voices that are traditionally not part of this conversation.\u201d\nIn a statement to ThinkProgress, Sunrise executive director Varshini Prakash celebrated labor unions\u2019 support for the state initiative, calling the broader idea of a Green New Deal \u201cAmerica\u2019s biggest union job creation program in a century.\u201d\nAcross the country, states and cities are seizing on the interest generated by the Green New Deal and introducing their own ambitious climate proposals. The federal version \u2014 currently a resolution, not a piece of legislation \u2014 calls for meeting 100% of the country\u2019s power demand with renewable, emissions-free sources in around a decade, all while using the transition to create jobs and enshrine social justice principles, like equal access to education and universal health care.\nLocal level efforts vary in their focus and ambition. Often, initiatives are exclusive to the power sector; as of last month, at least 19 states are considering or have already set 100% clean or renewable electricity targets. But others are working to capture the full spirit of a Green New Deal \u2014 which means incorporating social justice tenets into the plan.\nLast week, Minnesota introduced its own Green New Deal bill built on close collaboration between youth activists and state lawmakers. Officials and activists in New Mexico, New York, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, as well as the city of Los Angeles, have all used Green New Deal language to frame and market their clean energy and climate initiatives.\nA key component of any Green New Deal is its timeframe. As the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned last fall, without dramatic change to cut greenhouse gasses, global emissions are set to rise to a level that would usher in catastrophic consequences in just over a decade.\nIn Maine, global warming of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures means more flooding along the coasts and inland, as well as increased drought and extreme heat. Scientists have found that the Gulf of Maine is already warming faster than 99% of the world\u2019s oceans, disrupting fishery patters and, in turn, the fishing industry.\nNext week, lawmakers will hold a public hearing for Maine\u2019s Green New Deal bill. A few weeks later, it will be put up for committee vote. And Maxmin thinks there\u2019s a good chance the bill will pass.\n\u201cIt has a name that is drawing attention to it \u2026 [and it\u2019s] really bringing people from so many backgrounds together,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it has a really good chance because it\u2019s basically an economic and job growth strategy for Maine.\u201d\nThis article has been updated to clarify that it was members of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Energy Committee that criticized the federal Green New Deal resolution.",

Funding could also be siphoned away from facilities that affect everyday life on domestic and international U.S. military bases, including dining halls, medical facilities, and roads.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s national emergency declaration allows him to divert $3.6 billion worth of funding from the programs Shanahan identified, in order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. It isn&rsquo;t known when the White House will make the $3.6 billion cut and from which Pentagon programs.</p>\n<p>But Shanahan&rsquo;s list doesn&rsquo;t account for an additional $2.5 billion in funding that Trump requested for his wall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>In his emergency declaration last month, Trump announced that in addition to diverting money from the military reconstruction budget, he would also take $2.5 billion from the Pentagon&rsquo;s counter-drug funding. But as The Washington Post reported, the counter-drug account currently has less than $100 million in it. This leaves the Pentagon the task of finding more projects to cut funding from and moving that money into the budget for the wall. There still isn&rsquo;t clarity on where that money will be coming from.</p>\n<p>Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), who sits on the Senate Armed Services committee, said in a statement that Trump &ldquo;is putting his border wall ahead of the safety of our troops.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The projects that could lose funding include military training centers in Virginia, a plant to prevent water contamination at Camp Lejeune, and a cybersecurity facility in Georgia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope my colleagues in Congress will take a serious look at the projects that support our military in their own states and then vote to override the president&rsquo;s veto.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Additionally, siphoning counter-drug funding from the Pentagon would do very little to actually stop drugs from crossing the U.S.- Mexico border. As ThinkProgress has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/why-even-trumps-thickest-border-wall-cant-stop-mexicos-drug-traffickers-e8ea31e234c7/\">previously reported</a>, most drugs come through vehicles by legal ports of entry.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, some of CBP&rsquo;s largest drug seizures have occurred at ports not located on the southern border. Nineteen million dollars&rsquo; worth of cocaine was discovered at a seaport in Savannah, Georgia last month, while 100 pounds of fentanyl was seized at the Port of Philadelphia the month prior.</p>\n<p>While Russell Vought, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, has stated that the money pooled from military projects will contribute to the &ldquo;full completion&rdquo; of the wall, the president&rsquo;s own administration has estimated that its total cost will be far higher. The White House requested $8.6 billion in funding from Congress for the 2020 fiscal year to help pay for the border wall, but the Department of Homeland Security has estimated that the wall could wind up costing $22 billion. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have warned of a $70 billion sticker price.</p>\n<p>Congress voted to reject Trump&rsquo;s national emergency declaration, but the president used his first veto on the legislation last week.</p>\n<p>Despite both the record-long shutdown over border wall funding and the national emergency declaration, a single new linear mile of border wall has yet to be constructed. The existing 694 miles were all constructed by Trump&rsquo;s predecessors.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mJNx-5CkPPE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><em>This piece was updated to clarify the Pentagon programs that could be cut.</em></p>",

Justice Merrick Garland provided the key fifth vote in <em><a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-supreme-courts-grand-showdown-over-partisan-gerrymandering-ends-with-a-whimper-6bd5bc22e38b/\">Gill v. Whitford</a> </em>to strike down the Wisconsin Republican Party&rsquo;s aggressive effort to immunize itself from elections. Lower courts are busy dismantling gerrymanders in states like North Carolina, Ohio, and Maryland. And in 2018, Wisconsin held its first competitive state assembly elections in years.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, here in this universe, the picture is much more grim. In 2018, Democratic Wisconsin state assembly candidates won 54 percent of the two-party popular vote, beating their Republican counterparts by 8 percentage points. Yet Republicans <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/wisconsin-skewed-2018-results-anthony-kennedy-98060a6a19e9/\">won 63 of the state&rsquo;s 99 assembly seats</a>.</p>\n<p>With Republicans in firm control of the Supreme Court in 2018, the high court decided not to decide <em>Gill</em>, leaving Wisconsin&rsquo;s gerrymander in place. Then Republicans gained an even tighter grip on the Supreme Court when Justice Anthony Kennedy &mdash; the court&rsquo;s occasional swing vote and the only member of its Republican majority who appeared <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/partisan-gerrymandering-scotus-1555f0a5140a/\">open to striking down partisan gerrymandering</a> &mdash; left the bench.</p>\n<p>All of which is a long way of saying that the outcomes in <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/\"><em>Rucho v. Common Cause</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/lamone-v-benisek/\"><em>Lamone v. Benisek</em></a>, two partisan gerrymandering cases that the Supreme Court will hear next Tuesday, are practically preordained. The Court will almost certainly vote 5-4 to hold that such gerrymanders cannot be dismantled by federal courts. Republicans will keep the profound advantages they gained in 2010, thanks to the coincidence of the fact that the GOP had a strong electoral year immediately before a redistricting cycle. States like Wisconsin will remain sham democracies.</p>\n<p>America got to this point, moreover, not because Republicans won national elections fair and square and that gave them the power to appoint pro-gerrymandering judges to the Supreme Court. We got here because the anti-democratic pathologies of the U.S. Constitution have begun to snowball &mdash; working together to preserve themselves and to promote further democratic erosion.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump would not be president if not for the Electoral College. Mitch McConnell would not be Senate Majority Leader if not for the malapportioned Senate. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh owe their jobs to the fact that the United States does not have free and fair elections. And they are now poised to use their offices to further entrench Republican rule.</p>\n<h4>A generation lost to democracy</h4>\n<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is, at age 29, the youngest member of Congress. As Mother Jones&rsquo; Tim Murphy notes, she&rsquo;s lived through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timothypmurphy/status/1105219640777756672\">exactly one presidential election</a> where Republicans won the nationwide popular vote.</p>\n<p>She shares this distinction with every American under the age of 30. At 41, I&rsquo;ve only been eligible to vote in one election, the election of 2004, where the American people voted to elect a Republican president. In 2022, assuming that Trump does not become the second Republican in AOC&rsquo;s lifetime to win the popular vote, there will be young voters who&rsquo;ve <em>never</em> lived through an election in which a Republican president won the popular vote.</p>\n<p>And yet Republicans control the White House, the judiciary, and the Senate. As Crooked Media&rsquo;s Brian Beutler notes, this disparity produced an entire generation of Americans who not only do not know what it is like to live in an America with democratic elections, and who, as a result, may never get to see the policies they support enacted.</p>\n<blockquote data-dnt=\"true\" data-width=\"500\"> <p>Lots of no-longer-very-young liberals have watched Republicans win the popular vote only once, watched Trump win with a minority of votes while cheating, and are now told we're stuck with a GOP Judiciary for life and little hope ever enacting the policies our candidates run on.</p> <p>&mdash; Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1105264501790773252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the United States does not choose its presidents through free and fair elections is exacerbated by the fact that we do not choose who controls the Senate through free and fair elections.</p>\n<p>The state of California has <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-senate-is-so-rigged-that-democrats-may-never-control-it-ever-again-14ede9ac5f01/\">68 times as many people</a> as the state of Wyoming. Indeed, the fourth largest city in California, San Francisco, has more than 300,000 more residents than the entire state of Wyoming. Yet Wyoming still gets two senators, just like California &mdash; effectively giving each person in Wyoming 68 times more representation than each Californian.</p>\n<p>The Republican &ldquo;majority&rdquo; in the current Senate represents <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W5BhwOITNmf49tpl3QW6eNWXmbseOkezquR4N2g3d7c/edit#gid=1726274342\">15 million fewer people</a> than the Democratic &ldquo;minority.&rdquo; The Republican &ldquo;majority&rdquo; in the Senate that confirmed Gorsuch and Kavanaugh represented <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-senate-is-so-rigged-that-democrats-may-never-control-it-ever-again-14ede9ac5f01/\">almost 40 million fewer people</a> than the Democratic &ldquo;minority.&rdquo; The Republican &ldquo;majority&rdquo; that refused to hold a confirmation hearing on Chief Judge Merrick Garland&rsquo;s nomination to the Supreme Court represented 20 million fewer people than the Democratic &ldquo;minority.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are the <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/the-unprecedented-illegitimacy-of-the-roberts-court-086dde8373bf/\">only members</a> of the Supreme Court in U.S. history who were nominated by the loser of the popular vote and confirmed by a bloc of senators who represent less than half of the nation.</p>\n<p>America&rsquo;s anti-democratic pathologies work in symbiosis. Sham elections beget anti-democratic judges, who render our elections even more of a sham.</p>\n<p>Even before Kavanaugh&rsquo;s arrival, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Republican majority cut deep into America&rsquo;s democratic norms. <a href=\"https://casetext.com/case/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn?ref=Sb!ILRPD3\"><em>Citizens United v. FEC</em></a> released a torrent of money into our elections. <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4053797526279899410&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr\"><em>Shelby County v. Holder</em></a> gutted much of the Voting Rights Act. A more obscure case, <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/scotus-presumption-of-white-racial-innocence-gerrymandering-7ad4fdfc82a5/\"><em>Abbott v. Perez</em></a>, held that white lawmakers enjoy such a strong presumption of racial innocence that it is virtually impossible to prove that they acted with racist intent when they wrote an election law that undercuts voters of color.</p>\n<p>Chief Justice John Roberts, moreover, <a href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/51/lets-think-about-court-packing-2/\">has fantasized about hobbling what remains of the Voting Rights Act</a> since he was a young Reagan administration lawyer. And he&rsquo;s widely considered the most moderate member of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s current Republican majority.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, when the Supreme Court takes up monumental cases like <em>Rucho</em> and <em>Benisek</em>, my job is to lay out the legal issues in those cases and offer some insight into how key members of the Supreme Court are likely to analyze those issues. I suppose I could do that now.</p>\n<p>I could throw around terms like &ldquo;efficiency gap&rdquo; or &ldquo;viewpoint discrimination&rdquo; or &ldquo;cracking&rdquo; and &ldquo;packing.&rdquo; I could note that <em>Benisek</em> involves a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland, and speculate that maybe that fact will help one of the court&rsquo;s Republicans see that gerrymandering undermines core democratic values that go beyond party.</p>\n<p>I could print damning quotes at the heart of the <em>Rucho </em>and <em>Benisek</em> cases. The co-chair of North Carolina&rsquo;s redistricting committee, for example, said that his state&rsquo;s congressional maps were drawn to ensure that North Carolina&rsquo;s congressional delegation would have 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats because it wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-422/90673/20190305115500844_18-422%20Brief%20of%20LWVNC_Revised_Final.pdf\">possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Democrats</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But really, what&rsquo;s the point? Chief Justice Roberts was <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/john-roberts-election-law-4757da7158cd/\">open about his reluctance</a> to strike down partisan gerrymanders when the issue was before him last term, and Roberts is, again, the least conservative of the court&rsquo;s Republicans. Barring a miracle, <em>Rucho </em>and <em>Benisek</em> will build on cases like <em>Citizens United</em>, <em>Shelby County</em>, and <em>Perez</em>. Democracy does not fare well in the Roberts Court.</p>\n<h4>The insidiousness of rigged elections</h4>\n<p>As I think about the almost certain fate of <em>Rucho </em>and <em>Benisek</em> and the constitutional thumb on our electoral scales that made this fate all but inevitable, I&rsquo;m reminded of an interview that former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D) gave at the Brookings Institution last month.</p>\n<p>Abrams knows something about voter suppression. Her opponent, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) served as Georgia&rsquo;s top elections officer at the same time that he was running to become its chief executive. Kemp <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/georgia-cancels-fewer-voter-registrations-after-surge-last-year/fqT1bcSzGu33UEpTMDzMVK/\">purged hundreds of thousands of voter registrations</a>. Just days before the election, he launched a <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/georgia-republican-brian-kemp-using-his-public-office-to-investigate-political-foes-4e1e369b38fc/\">bizarre investigation</a> against the state&rsquo;s Democratic Party, claiming <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/04/us/politics/georgia-elections-kemp-voters-hack.html\">without evidence</a> that Democrats &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; Georgia&rsquo;s voter registration system.</p>\n<p>And yet, at her Brookings event, Abrams warned that small-d democrats risk becoming complicit in voter suppression every time they shine a light on it. &ldquo;Voter suppression isn&rsquo;t simply saying you can&rsquo;t vote,&rdquo; the former candidate explained. &ldquo;Voter suppression is both a physical activity, but it&rsquo;s also a psychic effect. Telling people their votes won&rsquo;t count, telling people that the system is rigged <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20190215_stacey_abrams_transcript.pdf\">has the act of actually stopping people from trying to use it</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Votes still matter in the United States. Thanks to the Electoral College, Trump has a baked-in advantage when he runs for reelection. But if just under 80,000 people had <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/hillary-clinton-2016-election-votes-supreme-court-liberal-justice-1b4bc4fc-9fad-44b4-ab54-9ef86aa9c1f1.html\">voted differently</a> in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton would be president right now.</p>\n<p>Democrats face an uphill battle to regain the Senate, but close elections in North Carolina, Maine, Arizona, and Colorado could allow them to return Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to the minority. Whether they succeed is likely to determine whether they have any chance of confirming anyone to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>But the stakes for each election are far higher than whether America will get a single-payer health system or whether billionaires will get another tax cut. With each election that Democrats lose, Republicans will entrench their control of the judiciary even further &mdash; and they will use that control to squeeze Democrats even harder in upcoming elections.</p>\n<p>Democrats, meanwhile, cannot merely hope to hold onto power until America&rsquo;s anti-democratic fever breaks. According to a University of Virginia analysis, just under half the country will live in only eight states by 2040 &mdash; so <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/12/in-about-20-years-half-the-population-will-live-in-eight-states/?utm_term=.d9c914fd126d\">half the country will have just 16 senators</a> while the other half has 84. About 70 percent of the country will live in only 16 states.</p>\n<p>If Democrats remain popular in population centers while Republicans continue to over-perform in sparsely populated states, in other words, Republicans will soon gain a permanent supermajority in the United States Senate &mdash; and with it, permanent control of the Supreme Court and a permanent power to reinterpret the Constitution.</p>\n<p>So Democrats have no choice but to confront the Constitution&rsquo;s anti-democratic pathologies head on. If they allow Senate malapportionment to continue, they will cease to exist as a viable political party.</p>",

                "text": "Somewhere, in an alternative universe where the winner of the 2016 presidential election lives in the White House, partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional. Justice Merrick Garland provided the key fifth vote in Gill v. Whitford to strike down the Wisconsin Republican Party\u2019s aggressive effort to immunize itself from elections. Lower courts are busy dismantling gerrymanders in states like North Carolina, Ohio, and Maryland. And in 2018, Wisconsin held its first competitive state assembly elections in years.\nMeanwhile, here in this universe, the picture is much more grim. In 2018, Democratic Wisconsin state assembly candidates won 54 percent of the two-party popular vote, beating their Republican counterparts by 8 percentage points. Yet Republicans won 63 of the state\u2019s 99 assembly seats.\nWith Republicans in firm control of the Supreme Court in 2018, the high court decided not to decide Gill, leaving Wisconsin\u2019s gerrymander in place. Then Republicans gained an even tighter grip on the Supreme Court when Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 the court\u2019s occasional swing vote and the only member of its Republican majority who appeared open to striking down partisan gerrymandering \u2014 left the bench.\nAll of which is a long way of saying that the outcomes in Rucho v. Common Cause and Lamone v. Benisek, two partisan gerrymandering cases that the Supreme Court will hear next Tuesday, are practically preordained. The Court will almost certainly vote 5-4 to hold that such gerrymanders cannot be dismantled by federal courts. Republicans will keep the profound advantages they gained in 2010, thanks to the coincidence of the fact that the GOP had a strong electoral year immediately before a redistricting cycle. States like Wisconsin will remain sham democracies.\nAmerica got to this point, moreover, not because Republicans won national elections fair and square and that gave them the power to appoint pro-gerrymandering judges to the Supreme Court. We got here because the anti-democratic pathologies of the U.S. Constitution have begun to snowball \u2014 working together to preserve themselves and to promote further democratic erosion.\nDonald Trump would not be president if not for the Electoral College. Mitch McConnell would not be Senate Majority Leader if not for the malapportioned Senate. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh owe their jobs to the fact that the United States does not have free and fair elections. And they are now poised to use their offices to further entrench Republican rule.\nA generation lost to democracy\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is, at age 29, the youngest member of Congress. As Mother Jones\u2019 Tim Murphy notes, she\u2019s lived through exactly one presidential election where Republicans won the nationwide popular vote.\nShe shares this distinction with every American under the age of 30. At 41, I\u2019ve only been eligible to vote in one election, the election of 2004, where the American people voted to elect a Republican president. In 2022, assuming that Trump does not become the second Republican in AOC\u2019s lifetime to win the popular vote, there will be young voters who\u2019ve never lived through an election in which a Republican president won the popular vote.\nAnd yet Republicans control the White House, the judiciary, and the Senate. As Crooked Media\u2019s Brian Beutler notes, this disparity produced an entire generation of Americans who not only do not know what it is like to live in an America with democratic elections, and who, as a result, may never get to see the policies they support enacted.\nLots of no-longer-very-young liberals have watched Republicans win the popular vote only once, watched Trump win with a minority of votes while cheating, and are now told we're stuck with a GOP Judiciary for life and little hope ever enacting the policies our candidates run on.\n\u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) March 12, 2019\nThe fact that the United States does not choose its presidents through free and fair elections is exacerbated by the fact that we do not choose who controls the Senate through free and fair elections.\nThe state of California has 68 times as many people as the state of Wyoming. Indeed, the fourth largest city in California, San Francisco, has more than 300,000 more residents than the entire state of Wyoming. Yet Wyoming still gets two senators, just like California \u2014 effectively giving each person in Wyoming 68 times more representation than each Californian.\nThe Republican \u201cmajority\u201d in the current Senate represents 15 million fewer people than the Democratic \u201cminority.\u201d The Republican \u201cmajority\u201d in the Senate that confirmed Gorsuch and Kavanaugh represented almost 40 million fewer people than the Democratic \u201cminority.\u201d The Republican \u201cmajority\u201d that refused to hold a confirmation hearing on Chief Judge Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court represented 20 million fewer people than the Democratic \u201cminority.\u201d\nGorsuch and Kavanaugh are the only members of the Supreme Court in U.S. history who were nominated by the loser of the popular vote and confirmed by a bloc of senators who represent less than half of the nation.\nAmerica\u2019s anti-democratic pathologies work in symbiosis. Sham elections beget anti-democratic judges, who render our elections even more of a sham.\nEven before Kavanaugh\u2019s arrival, the Supreme Court\u2019s Republican majority cut deep into America\u2019s democratic norms. Citizens United v. FEC released a torrent of money into our elections. Shelby County v. Holder gutted much of the Voting Rights Act. A more obscure case, Abbott v. Perez, held that white lawmakers enjoy such a strong presumption of racial innocence that it is virtually impossible to prove that they acted with racist intent when they wrote an election law that undercuts voters of color.\nChief Justice John Roberts, moreover, has fantasized about hobbling what remains of the Voting Rights Act since he was a young Reagan administration lawyer. And he\u2019s widely considered the most moderate member of the Supreme Court\u2019s current Republican majority.\nOrdinarily, when the Supreme Court takes up monumental cases like Rucho and Benisek, my job is to lay out the legal issues in those cases and offer some insight into how key members of the Supreme Court are likely to analyze those issues. I suppose I could do that now.\nI could throw around terms like \u201cefficiency gap\u201d or \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d or \u201ccracking\u201d and \u201cpacking.\u201d I could note that Benisek involves a Democratic gerrymander in Maryland, and speculate that maybe that fact will help one of the court\u2019s Republicans see that gerrymandering undermines core democratic values that go beyond party.\nI could print damning quotes at the heart of the Rucho and Benisek cases. The co-chair of North Carolina\u2019s redistricting committee, for example, said that his state\u2019s congressional maps were drawn to ensure that North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation would have 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats because it wasn\u2019t \u201cpossible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Democrats.\u201d\nBut really, what\u2019s the point? Chief Justice Roberts was open about his reluctance to strike down partisan gerrymanders when the issue was before him last term, and Roberts is, again, the least conservative of the court\u2019s Republicans. Barring a miracle, Rucho and Benisek will build on cases like Citizens United, Shelby County, and Perez. Democracy does not fare well in the Roberts Court.\nThe insidiousness of rigged elections\nAs I think about the almost certain fate of Rucho and Benisek and the constitutional thumb on our electoral scales that made this fate all but inevitable, I\u2019m reminded of an interview that former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (D) gave at the Brookings Institution last month.\nAbrams knows something about voter suppression. Her opponent, then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp (R) served as Georgia\u2019s top elections officer at the same time that he was running to become its chief executive. Kemp purged hundreds of thousands of voter registrations. Just days before the election, he launched a bizarre investigation against the state\u2019s Democratic Party, claiming without evidence that Democrats \u201chacked\u201d Georgia\u2019s voter registration system.\nAnd yet, at her Brookings event, Abrams warned that small-d democrats risk becoming complicit in voter suppression every time they shine a light on it. \u201cVoter suppression isn\u2019t simply saying you can\u2019t vote,\u201d the former candidate explained. \u201cVoter suppression is both a physical activity, but it\u2019s also a psychic effect. Telling people their votes won\u2019t count, telling people that the system is rigged has the act of actually stopping people from trying to use it.\u201d\nVotes still matter in the United States. Thanks to the Electoral College, Trump has a baked-in advantage when he runs for reelection. But if just under 80,000 people had voted differently in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton would be president right now.\nDemocrats face an uphill battle to regain the Senate, but close elections in North Carolina, Maine, Arizona, and Colorado could allow them to return Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to the minority. Whether they succeed is likely to determine whether they have any chance of confirming anyone to the Supreme Court.\nBut the stakes for each election are far higher than whether America will get a single-payer health system or whether billionaires will get another tax cut. With each election that Democrats lose, Republicans will entrench their control of the judiciary even further \u2014 and they will use that control to squeeze Democrats even harder in upcoming elections.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, cannot merely hope to hold onto power until America\u2019s anti-democratic fever breaks. According to a University of Virginia analysis, just under half the country will live in only eight states by 2040 \u2014 so half the country will have just 16 senators while the other half has 84. About 70 percent of the country will live in only 16 states.\nIf Democrats remain popular in population centers while Republicans continue to over-perform in sparsely populated states, in other words, Republicans will soon gain a permanent supermajority in the United States Senate \u2014 and with it, permanent control of the Supreme Court and a permanent power to reinterpret the Constitution.\nSo Democrats have no choice but to confront the Constitution\u2019s anti-democratic pathologies head on. If they allow Senate malapportionment to continue, they will cease to exist as a viable political party.",

CREDIT: Robert Alexander/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Activists are vowing to fight back after the Tennessee House of Representatives advanced a bill Monday that would impose fines on voter registration organizations that turn in incomplete forms.</p>\n<p>The legislation would impose fines ranging from $150 to $2,000 if groups turn in between 100 to 500 unfinished forms. If a group turns more than 500 incomplete forms, they could face fines up to $10,000. Additionally, the legislation would require the groups to submit voter registration forms within 10 days and would also prohibit poll watchers from out of state.</p>\n<p>Voting rights activists mobilized quickly to demonstrate their opposition to the measure. &ldquo;Everyone was all hands on deck,&rdquo; Tequila Johnson, statewide manager of the Tennessee Black Voter Project, told ThinkProgress Tuesday. &ldquo;We got as many supporters as we could to come and show support and there were probably 200 people [there].&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Protesters gathered inside and outside the state capitol building, Johnson said, including inside the chamber, where they were told they needed to be silent. The legislators themselves, however, were cheering and clapping, she said.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;They were antagonizing us&hellip; It shows how divisive our state legislature is,&rdquo; she said, adding that she felt the lawmakers were treating the bill like a competition, rather than thinking &ldquo;about what&rsquo;s right for our state.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The bill was originally put forward by Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett (R). According to a Nashville Public Radio report, Hargett&rsquo;s office said the legislation was prompted by attempts led by the Black Voter Project to quickly register thousands of people in Memphis, Tennessee, before the registration deadline last year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Secretary of State&rsquo;s offices brought this bill to encourage responsible voter registration efforts going forward,&rdquo; state Rep. Tim Rudd (R) told Nashville Public Radio Monday.</p>\n<p>Johnson acknowledged Tuesday that the Black Voter Project handed in incomplete forms to the state, but that they only did so because they were told holding onto the forms would be illegal. She said they reached out directly to Hargett&rsquo;s office at the time but did not get any guidance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Even though the bill did pass the House, I didn&rsquo;t feel defeated,&rdquo; Johnson said. Rather, being there with so many other people who were engaged in fighting back felt empowering.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Johnson said, doing the work she is doing now, &ldquo;standing on the shoulders [of civil rights heroes] and looking at the same devils, the same demons, is just mind blowing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now, the state Senate is scheduled to take up the legislation in their Thursday morning session. Johnson said to expect major protests when they do.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are going to keep educating people,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The legislation comes after the Tennessee Black Voter Project sued Shelby County along with the Memphis NAACP last year. At the time, the county&rsquo;s election commission was preventing people with incomplete voter registration applications from fixing any problems, like missing addresses or illegible handwriting, and ultimately from voting on Election Day.</p>\n<p>The Black Voter Project and the NAACP won their case, and with just over a week to go before Election Day, ordered the election commission to allow people to fix any problems on their applications and vote in the upcoming election.</p>\n<p>As of 2018, Tennessee was ranked 49th in the country in voter participation. According to Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the Tennessee ACLU, this bill would only make matters worse.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always said your vote is your voice&hellip; [and] fair and free elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and these proposed restrictions inhibit civic engagement and chill individuals&rsquo; and organizations pursuing voter registration abilities,&rdquo; Weinberg said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>If the bill is signed into law, it would make Tennessee the only state in the country that has both criminal and civil penalties for submitting &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; forms.</p>\n<p>Additionally, she noted, it would put the onus on people working at registration drives &mdash; often volunteers &mdash; to make a call about whether or not to hand in forms, something that could create more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no question the legislature should be pursuing initiatives that not only encourage individuals to register to vote and then vote. [They] should be celebrating when there are multiple voter registration drives in both urban and rural settings,&rdquo; Weinberg said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear we should not be proud of our voter registration rate compared to other states&hellip; [and] this bill is creating additional problems.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Activists are vowing to fight back after the Tennessee House of Representatives advanced a bill Monday that would impose fines on voter registration organizations that turn in incomplete forms.\nThe legislation would impose fines ranging from $150 to $2,000 if groups turn in between 100 to 500 unfinished forms. If a group turns more than 500 incomplete forms, they could face fines up to $10,000. Additionally, the legislation would require the groups to submit voter registration forms within 10 days and would also prohibit poll watchers from out of state.\nVoting rights activists mobilized quickly to demonstrate their opposition to the measure. \u201cEveryone was all hands on deck,\u201d Tequila Johnson, statewide manager of the Tennessee Black Voter Project, told ThinkProgress Tuesday. \u201cWe got as many supporters as we could to come and show support and there were probably 200 people [there].\u201d\nProtesters gathered inside and outside the state capitol building, Johnson said, including inside the chamber, where they were told they needed to be silent. The legislators themselves, however, were cheering and clapping, she said.\n\u201cThey were antagonizing us\u2026 It shows how divisive our state legislature is,\u201d she said, adding that she felt the lawmakers were treating the bill like a competition, rather than thinking \u201cabout what\u2019s right for our state.\u201d\nThe bill was originally put forward by Tennessee Secretary of State Tre Hargett (R). According to a Nashville Public Radio report, Hargett\u2019s office said the legislation was prompted by attempts led by the Black Voter Project to quickly register thousands of people in Memphis, Tennessee, before the registration deadline last year.\n\u201cThe Secretary of State\u2019s offices brought this bill to encourage responsible voter registration efforts going forward,\u201d state Rep. Tim Rudd (R) told Nashville Public Radio Monday.\nJohnson acknowledged Tuesday that the Black Voter Project handed in incomplete forms to the state, but that they only did so because they were told holding onto the forms would be illegal. She said they reached out directly to Hargett\u2019s office at the time but did not get any guidance.\n\u201cEven though the bill did pass the House, I didn\u2019t feel defeated,\u201d Johnson said. Rather, being there with so many other people who were engaged in fighting back felt empowering.\nAt the same time, Johnson said, doing the work she is doing now, \u201cstanding on the shoulders [of civil rights heroes] and looking at the same devils, the same demons, is just mind blowing.\u201d\nNow, the state Senate is scheduled to take up the legislation in their Thursday morning session. Johnson said to expect major protests when they do.\n\u201cWe are going to keep educating people,\u201d she said.\nThe legislation comes after the Tennessee Black Voter Project sued Shelby County along with the Memphis NAACP last year. At the time, the county\u2019s election commission was preventing people with incomplete voter registration applications from fixing any problems, like missing addresses or illegible handwriting, and ultimately from voting on Election Day.\nThe Black Voter Project and the NAACP won their case, and with just over a week to go before Election Day, ordered the election commission to allow people to fix any problems on their applications and vote in the upcoming election.\nAs of 2018, Tennessee was ranked 49th in the country in voter participation. According to Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the Tennessee ACLU, this bill would only make matters worse.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always said your vote is your voice\u2026 [and] fair and free elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and these proposed restrictions inhibit civic engagement and chill individuals\u2019 and organizations pursuing voter registration abilities,\u201d Weinberg said Tuesday.\nIf the bill is signed into law, it would make Tennessee the only state in the country that has both criminal and civil penalties for submitting \u201cdeficient\u201d forms.\nAdditionally, she noted, it would put the onus on people working at registration drives \u2014 often volunteers \u2014 to make a call about whether or not to hand in forms, something that could create more problems than it solves.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question the legislature should be pursuing initiatives that not only encourage individuals to register to vote and then vote. [They] should be celebrating when there are multiple voter registration drives in both urban and rural settings,\u201d Weinberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear we should not be proud of our voter registration rate compared to other states\u2026 [and] this bill is creating additional problems.\u201d",

CREDIT: Marcelo Camargo/Ag&ecirc;ncia Brasil</figcaption></figure>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never heard of Ricardo Salles, it&rsquo;s helpful to think of him as another version of Scott Pruitt. There&rsquo;s a lot the Brazilian environmental minister has in common with the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, who <a data-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt-industry/embattled-epa-chiefs-calendar-shows-industry-had-his-ear-idUSKCN1HD2G0\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-pruitt-industry/embattled-epa-chiefs-calendar-shows-industry-had-his-ear-idUSKCN1HD2G0\">rolled back </a>countless environmental protections while meeting with fossil fuel industry insiders.</p>\n<p>Like Pruitt, Salles seems poised to serve industry interests under Brazil&rsquo;s new far-right leader, President Jair Bolsonaro. Salles has targeted the country&rsquo;s environmental protection agency, IBAMA, firing administrators and key officials, <a data-href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/2019-brazil-crisis-issue-brief.pdf\" href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/assets/files/2019-brazil-crisis-issue-brief.pdf\">stripping it of its power to police environmental crimes</a>, and looking into ways to streamline environmental licensing to favor the agribusiness sector.</p>\n<p>And, like Pruitt, Salles has had his share of past scandals. Salles was <a data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/brazil-environmental-minister-still-likely-to-serve-bolsonaro-despite-misconduct\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/brazil-environmental-minister-still-likely-to-serve-bolsonaro-despite-misconduct\">found guilty in December of altering maps</a> for mining companies&rsquo; and other industries&rsquo; benefit while he was secretary of the environment of S&atilde;o Paulo between 2016 and 2017.</p>\n<p> <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"> <figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a>   </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>Unfortunately, unlike the round of investigative journalism that ultimately ousted Pruitt, it just got much harder to look into Salles&rsquo; activity. Last week, IBAMA&rsquo;s communications chief was forced out after <a data-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-environment/brazil-right-wing-government-puts-gag-order-on-environment-agency-idUSL1N2101V2\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/brazil-environment/brazil-right-wing-government-puts-gag-order-on-environment-agency-idUSL1N2101V2\">reportedly continuing to speak with journalists</a> counter to orders from Bolsonaro&rsquo;s administration. Salles&rsquo; office now controls all press requests sent to the agency.</p>\n<p>Another key similarity between Salles and Pruitt: their bosses. Bolsonaro, who took office in January after riding to victory on a wave of populist rhetoric, has earned the nickname &ldquo;tropical Trump.&rdquo; In his first visit to the United States as president this week, Bolsonaro reportedly met with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on Monday evening. On Tuesday, he delivered a joint press conference with President Donald Trump, during which the two <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/bolsonaro-trump-praise-one-another-during-brazilian-presidents-first-visit-ca1d1ed98f1a/\">praised each other</a> for their similar policies.</p>\n<p>Like Trump, Bolsonaro has shown disdain for international climate diplomacy. He has <a data-href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/01/commentary-will-president-bolsonaro-withdraw-brazil-from-the-paris-agreement/\" href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2019/01/commentary-will-president-bolsonaro-withdraw-brazil-from-the-paris-agreement/\">openly considered</a> pulling out of the Paris climate agreement and <a data-href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181128-brazil-host-2019-cop25-climate-change-bolsonaro\" href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20181128-brazil-host-2019-cop25-climate-change-bolsonaro\">walked back </a>Brazil&rsquo;s promise to host this year&rsquo;s U.N. climate change conference. And while Trump&rsquo;s white nationalism has certainly manifested in policies carried out by the <a data-href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/7/9/17542240/environmental-racism-justice-scott-pruitt-donald-trump\" href=\"https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/7/9/17542240/environmental-racism-justice-scott-pruitt-donald-trump\">EPA </a>and the <a data-href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/18/protecting-indigenous-lands-protects-environment-trump-bolsonaro-threaten-both/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2bc214953e2e\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/18/protecting-indigenous-lands-protects-environment-trump-bolsonaro-threaten-both/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2bc214953e2e\">Department of Interior</a>, Bolsonaro&rsquo;s favors to businesses interested in rolling back environmental protections directly reflects his own racist rhetoric against Brazil&rsquo;s <a data-href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/nature-destruction-climate-change-world-biodiversity_n_5c49e78ce4b06ba6d3bb2d44\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/nature-destruction-climate-change-world-biodiversity_n_5c49e78ce4b06ba6d3bb2d44\">900,000 indigenous people</a>, who hold about 13 percent of Brazil&rsquo;s lands, mostly in the Amazon.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Indians do not speak our language, they do not have money, they do not have culture,&rdquo; Bolsonaro<a data-href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3540-Bolsonaro\" href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3540-Bolsonaro\"> told a newspaper</a> before his campaign. &ldquo;They are native peoples. How did they manage to get 13 percent of the national territory?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While serving in Congress in 2016, Bolsonaro vowed to &ldquo;rip up&rdquo; an indigenous territory in northern Brazil, promising to &ldquo;give all the ranchers guns.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro pledged to open the Amazon to economic exploitation and promised to greatly expand energy production, abolish Brazil&rsquo;s environmental ministry, relax environmental licensing and regulation and open indigenous reserves to mining. While much of his 60-day tenure has been <a data-href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-steve-bannon-olavo-de-carvalho_n_5c8fb5a1e4b0d50544fe2318\" href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-steve-bannon-olavo-de-carvalho_n_5c8fb5a1e4b0d50544fe2318\">rocked by scandal and ineffective policies</a>, when it comes to how his administration is dismantling environmental protections, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not following the news in Portuguese on a regular basis, you&rsquo;re missing [key news] because it&rsquo;s moving very, very swiftly,&rdquo; said Christian Poirier, the program director at Amazon Watch. &ldquo;The pace of devastating rollbacks is mind-boggling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Bolsonaro&rsquo;s priorities were on full display during the first week of his administration. In one of his first acts in office, Bolsonaro transferred responsibilities for creating and regulating indigenous land reserves from Brazil&rsquo;s indigenous affairs agency to the Agriculture Ministry. Bolsonaro&rsquo;s choice for agricultural minister was part of the agribusiness caucus in the lower house and has slammed critiques of the industry, while the secretary overseeing land reform is an &ldquo;extreme, hardline, right-wing, violent rancher,&rdquo; according to Poirier.</p>\n<p>Brazil&rsquo;s indigenous people refer to the agribusiness industry as their &ldquo;historic enemy,&rdquo; Poirier said. As industries like mining and large-scale farming and ranching seek to expand further into the Amazon, they have <a data-href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0220-brazils-indigenous-peoples-suffer-wave-of-invasions-and-attacks\" href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0220-brazils-indigenous-peoples-suffer-wave-of-invasions-and-attacks\">partnered with a conservative political bloc</a>, known as the <em>ruralistas</em>, to strip indigenous land protections.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The agribusiness sector in Brazil has very much connected the dots between indigenous rights and forest protections, because they want to remove forest protection,&rdquo; Poirier explains. &ldquo;These protected areas are essentially off the market&hellip; [Agribusinesses] want to create the precedent to open up the protected areas to industrial activity. They know the Achilles&rsquo; heel is indigenous rights. They&rsquo;re attacking them as kind of the spearhead of an overall environmental assault.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While Bolsonaro&rsquo;s government carries out policy attacks, literal attacks are also occurring in indigenous territories. At least <a data-href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0220-brazils-indigenous-peoples-suffer-wave-of-invasions-and-attacks\" href=\"https://amazonwatch.org/news/2019/0220-brazils-indigenous-peoples-suffer-wave-of-invasions-and-attacks\">14 territories</a> have been systematically invaded over the past three months by organized and armed &ldquo;mafias,&rdquo; who intend to scout logging, farming, and mining areas. In January, Brazilian advocacy group CIMI <a data-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-indigenous/emboldened-by-bolsonaro-armed-invaders-encroach-on-brazils-tribal-lands-idUSKCN1QK0BG\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-indigenous/emboldened-by-bolsonaro-armed-invaders-encroach-on-brazils-tribal-lands-idUSKCN1QK0BG\">told Reuters</a> that land invasions had increased 150 percent since Bolsonaro&rsquo;s election. (In January, Bolsonaro tweeted out a video link interview where one of his ministers claimed that indigenous territories were &ldquo;established using fraudulent documents,&rdquo; <a data-href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/16/brazil-bolsonaro-indigenous-land/\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/02/16/brazil-bolsonaro-indigenous-land/\">according to The Intercept</a>.)</p>\n<p>Indigenous communities and other land rights activists &ldquo;are resisting at their own peril,&rdquo; Poirier said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very, very little sign that brutality and murder against them will be fully met with justice. Quite the opposite. It&rsquo;s the sign that there will be generalized impunity and lawlessness.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Protecting the Amazon, the world&rsquo;s largest carbon sink, is crucial to the future of the climate. The forest stores an estimated one-sixth of the world&rsquo;s plant-based carbon. A recent <a data-href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/03/wri-researcher-indigenous-people-are-best-forest-stewards/\" href=\"https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/03/wri-researcher-indigenous-people-are-best-forest-stewards/\">study</a> found that granting tribal land protections in the Peruvian Amazon led to an overwhelming reduction in tree clearing.</p>\n<p>And unlike many Americans, Brazilians have consistently said that they care about what happens to the Amazon and how it will impact human existence. A 2015 Pew survey showed Brazil was one of the <a data-href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/\" href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/11/05/global-concern-about-climate-change-broad-support-for-limiting-emissions/\">top countries</a> with more than 70 percent of the population saying they&rsquo;re &ldquo;very concerned&rdquo; that climate change will harm them personally.</p>\n<p>But like Trump&rsquo;s own attacks of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; on climate, Bolsonaro&rsquo;s regime is making it difficult for this message to spread, Poirier said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very much the work of the [indigenous rights] movement in Brazil, to say, look, our rights and your future are inherently entwined because the destruction of our forests, our homes, means the end of your climate,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s far along enough, especially now under Bolsonaro and all the misinformation that is reaching people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Given the public backlash against Pruitt&rsquo;s denial, Bolsonaro and Salles might want to pay attention to one of the <a data-href=\"https://qz.com/1574522/pictures-climate-change-protests-by-young-people-around-the-world/\" href=\"https://qz.com/1574522/pictures-climate-change-protests-by-young-people-around-the-world/\">signs held up by student protesters in Sao Paolo</a> last week: &ldquo;Hey, Ricardo Salles: Climate change is not fake news.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>Molly Taft writes for </em><a data-href=\"https://nexusmedianews.com/\" href=\"https://nexusmedianews.com/\"><em>Nexus Media</em></a><em>, a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.

                "text": "If you\u2019ve never heard of Ricardo Salles, it\u2019s helpful to think of him as another version of Scott Pruitt. There\u2019s a lot the Brazilian environmental minister has in common with the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, who rolled back countless environmental protections while meeting with fossil fuel industry insiders.\nLike Pruitt, Salles seems poised to serve industry interests under Brazil\u2019s new far-right leader, President Jair Bolsonaro. Salles has targeted the country\u2019s environmental protection agency, IBAMA, firing administrators and key officials, stripping it of its power to police environmental crimes, and looking into ways to streamline environmental licensing to favor the agribusiness sector.\nAnd, like Pruitt, Salles has had his share of past scandals. Salles was found guilty in December of altering maps for mining companies\u2019 and other industries\u2019 benefit while he was secretary of the environment of S\u00e3o Paulo between 2016 and 2017.\nUnfortunately, unlike the round of investigative journalism that ultimately ousted Pruitt, it just got much harder to look into Salles\u2019 activity. Last week, IBAMA\u2019s communications chief was forced out after reportedly continuing to speak with journalists counter to orders from Bolsonaro\u2019s administration. Salles\u2019 office now controls all press requests sent to the agency.\nAnother key similarity between Salles and Pruitt: their bosses. Bolsonaro, who took office in January after riding to victory on a wave of populist rhetoric, has earned the nickname \u201ctropical Trump.\u201d In his first visit to the United States as president this week, Bolsonaro reportedly met with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on Monday evening. On Tuesday, he delivered a joint press conference with President Donald Trump, during which the two praised each other for their similar policies.\nLike Trump, Bolsonaro has shown disdain for international climate diplomacy. He has openly considered pulling out of the Paris climate agreement and walked back Brazil\u2019s promise to host this year\u2019s U.N. climate change conference. And while Trump\u2019s white nationalism has certainly manifested in policies carried out by the EPA and the Department of Interior, Bolsonaro\u2019s favors to businesses interested in rolling back environmental protections directly reflects his own racist rhetoric against Brazil\u2019s 900,000 indigenous people, who hold about 13 percent of Brazil\u2019s lands, mostly in the Amazon.\n\u201cThe Indians do not speak our language, they do not have money, they do not have culture,\u201d Bolsonaro told a newspaper before his campaign. \u201cThey are native peoples. How did they manage to get 13 percent of the national territory?\u201d\nWhile serving in Congress in 2016, Bolsonaro vowed to \u201crip up\u201d an indigenous territory in northern Brazil, promising to \u201cgive all the ranchers guns.\u201d\nOn the campaign trail, Bolsonaro pledged to open the Amazon to economic exploitation and promised to greatly expand energy production, abolish Brazil\u2019s environmental ministry, relax environmental licensing and regulation and open indigenous reserves to mining. While much of his 60-day tenure has been rocked by scandal and ineffective policies, when it comes to how his administration is dismantling environmental protections, \u201cif you\u2019re not following the news in Portuguese on a regular basis, you\u2019re missing [key news] because it\u2019s moving very, very swiftly,\u201d said Christian Poirier, the program director at Amazon Watch. \u201cThe pace of devastating rollbacks is mind-boggling.\u201d\nBolsonaro\u2019s priorities were on full display during the first week of his administration. In one of his first acts in office, Bolsonaro transferred responsibilities for creating and regulating indigenous land reserves from Brazil\u2019s indigenous affairs agency to the Agriculture Ministry. Bolsonaro\u2019s choice for agricultural minister was part of the agribusiness caucus in the lower house and has slammed critiques of the industry, while the secretary overseeing land reform is an \u201cextreme, hardline, right-wing, violent rancher,\u201d according to Poirier.\nBrazil\u2019s indigenous people refer to the agribusiness industry as their \u201chistoric enemy,\u201d Poirier said. As industries like mining and large-scale farming and ranching seek to expand further into the Amazon, they have partnered with a conservative political bloc, known as the ruralistas, to strip indigenous land protections.\n\u201cThe agribusiness sector in Brazil has very much connected the dots between indigenous rights and forest protections, because they want to remove forest protection,\u201d Poirier explains. \u201cThese protected areas are essentially off the market\u2026 [Agribusinesses] want to create the precedent to open up the protected areas to industrial activity. They know the Achilles\u2019 heel is indigenous rights. They\u2019re attacking them as kind of the spearhead of an overall environmental assault.\u201d\nWhile Bolsonaro\u2019s government carries out policy attacks, literal attacks are also occurring in indigenous territories. At least 14 territories have been systematically invaded over the past three months by organized and armed \u201cmafias,\u201d who intend to scout logging, farming, and mining areas. In January, Brazilian advocacy group CIMI told Reuters that land invasions had increased 150 percent since Bolsonaro\u2019s election. (In January, Bolsonaro tweeted out a video link interview where one of his ministers claimed that indigenous territories were \u201cestablished using fraudulent documents,\u201d according to The Intercept.)\nIndigenous communities and other land rights activists \u201care resisting at their own peril,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cThere\u2019s very, very little sign that brutality and murder against them will be fully met with justice. Quite the opposite. It\u2019s the sign that there will be generalized impunity and lawlessness.\u201d\nProtecting the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest carbon sink, is crucial to the future of the climate. The forest stores an estimated one-sixth of the world\u2019s plant-based carbon. A recent study found that granting tribal land protections in the Peruvian Amazon led to an overwhelming reduction in tree clearing.\nAnd unlike many Americans, Brazilians have consistently said that they care about what happens to the Amazon and how it will impact human existence. A 2015 Pew survey showed Brazil was one of the top countries with more than 70 percent of the population saying they\u2019re \u201cvery concerned\u201d that climate change will harm them personally.\nBut like Trump\u2019s own attacks of \u201cfake news\u201d on climate, Bolsonaro\u2019s regime is making it difficult for this message to spread, Poirier said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s very much the work of the [indigenous rights] movement in Brazil, to say, look, our rights and your future are inherently entwined because the destruction of our forests, our homes, means the end of your climate,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s far along enough, especially now under Bolsonaro and all the misinformation that is reaching people.\u201d\nGiven the public backlash against Pruitt\u2019s denial, Bolsonaro and Salles might want to pay attention to one of the signs held up by student protesters in Sao Paolo last week: \u201cHey, Ricardo Salles: Climate change is not fake news.\u201d\nMolly Taft writes for Nexus Media, a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.

The city of Flint, Michigan, has not had access to clean drinking water since 2014 due to lead contamination. In 2016, President Barack Obama signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently awarded a $120 million grant to Michigan to repair Flint&rsquo;s water systems. But it wasn&rsquo;t until just this week, well over two years after the funding was designated, that Flint <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/439237-flint-gets-remaining-777m-in-federal-funds-for-water\">received the bulk of the federal funds </a>&mdash; $77.7 million. Nestl&eacute; has agreed to <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/nestle-extends-flint-bottled-water-donations-through-august\">extend its donations</a> of free bottled water to the city through August.</p>\n<p>Puerto Rico disaster relief following the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Maria has also continued to stall because of Trump&rsquo;s obstruction, and the fight has spilled over into Congress. Earlier this month, Senate Democrats <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/democrats-reject-spending-bill-underfunds-puerto-rico-disaster-relief-b05b15ab81e3/\">rejected a Republican proposal</a> that would have stripped significant funding to Puerto Rico that House Democrats had approved. Republican lawmakers were catering to Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/26/trump-seems-inflate-price-tag-puerto-ricos-recovery-deny-funding-puerto-ricos-recovery/?utm_term=.81fbf7f1fe0d\">falsely</a> claimed that Puerto Rico had already received $91 billion in hurricane relief funding. In reality, only $41 billion has been allocated, and the territory has only received about $10 billion in total. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has pushed to investigate whether the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/03/26/hud-inspector-generals-office-says-itll-look-into-whether-white-house-interfered-with-puerto-rico-disaster-aid/?utm_term=.772444d0fdf2\">intentionally dragged its feet</a> to block much of this funding from being dispersed.</p>\n<p>Specific disasters aside, the Trump administration has also made a habit of taking funding away from programs that support the nation&rsquo;s most vulnerable in order to fund its anti-immigrant family separation policies. Over the past year, it has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/20/politics/hhs-shifting-money-cancer-aids-immigrant-children/index.html\">diverted</a> millions of dollars away from programs like Head Start, the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, and the National Cancer Institute to fund cages for children at the border.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s domestic funding decisions have deprioritized people of color. Meanwhile, in her statement, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described Notre Dame as an &ldquo;irreplaceable symbol of Western civilization.&rdquo; This rhetoric feeds into <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/far-right-notre-dame-fire-conspiracy-western-civilization-1a1bbd483a72/\">conspiracy theories spread this week</a> by white nationalists and other extremists who claim that the cathedral was targeted for arson by non-&ldquo;western&rdquo; individuals.</p>\n<p>So far, more than $1 billion has been raised worldwide to help rebuild Notre Dame. The giving has spilled over into growing support for the Louisiana churches, with the now-viral crowdfunding campaign raising more than <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/church-fires-st-landry-parishmacedonia-ministry\">$1 million</a> at the time of publication Tuesday &mdash; but that&rsquo;s in spite of silence from Trump.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGXVg8Zxltk?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent\"></iframe></figure>",

If the Trump-DeVos proposals succeed in shifting more of the immediate costs of college onto students, wealthy families will absorb the blow more easily. Middle-income families eager to keep up, however, would end up taking on much more costly private student loans to fill the gap created by the caps. Their inevitable struggles to make the often-usurious payments on such loans, will allow lawmakers to simply shrug and click their tongues about personal responsibility &mdash; especially since those new defaults won&rsquo;t be hitting the government&rsquo;s own balance sheet.</p>\n<p>And for the vast bottom of the income and wealth distribution where shaky credit histories put even those predatory loans out of reach, graduate degrees &ndash; and in some cases even undergraduate education &ndash; would simply become inaccessible.</p>\n<p>Though the policy would &ldquo;disproportionately affect students who can&rsquo;t get private loans,&rdquo; as Seton Hall college finance expert Robert Kelchen <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-administration-proposes-capping-loans-to-graduate-students-and-parents-2019-03-18/print\">told Marketwatch</a>, it is based on policy logic with wide and longstanding support &ndash; especially from the political right.</p>\n<p>Conservative lawmakers and some academics believe that capping government lending amounts would induce educational institutions to lower tuition and living expenses. But the evidence for that market engineering hypothesis is <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/03/19/white-house-issues-priorities-higher-education-act\">shaky</a>.</p>\n<p>The proposal provides no hard numbers, but higher education experts pointed to a 2017 bill crafted by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) that contained specific plans for reaching several of the policy goals the White House pointed toward.</p>\n<p>The legislation included a $12,500 annual cap for parent loans to fund dependent children&rsquo;s undergraduate or graduate degree costs. Even experts who support the general idea that colleges would cut prices in response to a lending cap from Washington say such a figure is too low to work.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some reasonable cap on borrowing definitely makes sense but capping it too low would mean that the private market would have to fill in the gap,&rdquo; New America higher ed expert Clare McCann said. &ldquo;That has implications for equity and access for those students.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>McCann said capping loans at a more reasonable level would probably drive down costs for graduate degrees and at for-profit undergraduate programs, as those two categories of institution are more likely to target their pricing based on what the government will fund. But for the vast majority of the higher education student body &ndash; undergrad degree-seekers at public universities &ndash; a cap on lending wouldn&rsquo;t shift prices at all.</p>\n<p>The better way to reduce the gap between what families borrow and what kids eventually earn, McCann said, is to drive more direct funding back into state schools. States are putting less money into higher education than they did before the Great Recession, and some kind of matching federal funds incentive to restore those defunct investments would go a lot further toward fixing the cost curve for future graduates.</p>\n<p>But none of these approaches to the balance of costs and debt for future learners will do anything for the 45 million people who already owe $1.5 trillion on student loans. There are better and worse approaches to reshaping the debt curve for future generations, Abrams said, but policymakers are in danger of whistling past an economy-shrinking graveyard if they don&rsquo;t also get radical on behalf of existing borrowers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So many of our policies are focused on new students. Let&rsquo;s say this proposal helps new borrowers. It doesn&rsquo;t touch any of the existing borrowers. We need to be doing things for them,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;Full debt forgiveness, or at least partial forgiveness for older loans, is something we can attain.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That kind of debt jubilee could be paid for through higher taxes on the same wealthy families that currently burn millions of dollars to help their kids get into the fanciest schools &ndash; whether through outlandish bribery schemes or more traditional donor patronage.</p>\n<p>Big ideas for tackling the existing debt crisis are unlikely to attach to the Higher Education Act legislative process, however. And as long as lawmakers are focused on the future of high ed funding, the risk remains that they&rsquo;ll find ways to make things worse down the road.</p>\n<p>The administration&rsquo;s policy proposal calls for expanding the Pell Grant system, for example &ndash; but not by restoring funding that&rsquo;s been cut from the program. Instead, the White House signaled a desire to grant wider access to Pell money for educational providers &ndash; something McCann called &ldquo;an incredibly popular bad idea.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The grants can already be used for educational programs as short as 15 weeks. Proposals circulating in recent years that reflect the vague language of Monday&rsquo;s policy statement would allow even an 8-week course to tap into Pell funding that was initially intended to prop up low-income students&rsquo; access to two- and four-year undergraduate programs with a clearer historical link to sustainable employment and earnings opportunities.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of students will be enticed by the notion of an 8-week program that leads to high wages, and that promise won&rsquo;t be fulfilled,&rdquo; McCann said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be spending their Pell Grant eligibility down on a program that just won&rsquo;t offer the kind of opportunity they think they&rsquo;re signing up for.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Such false promises are simply too tempting to resist for borrowers. For-profit colleges have long marketed their offerings in misleading fashion, aiming their ads at daytime television viewers and targeting their price schedules to extract exactly as much cash as federal lending policies allow. This marketing push could grow even more aggressive if the feds let those same vultures into the Pell vault.</p>\n<p>This administration is famously cozy with the for-profit education industry. DeVos has already halted or reversed a variety of regulatory efforts from her predecessors that aimed to reshape business models and rein in profiteering by the kinds of companies that made her family&rsquo;s fortune.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What Trump and Devos are doing with education is just unwinding the little bit of good that Obama did at the end of his term,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about helping big business and hurting borrowers and students.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Potentially kleptocratic policymaking around higher education finance would be ethically troubling even in normal times. But total outstanding student loan debts cracked the trillion-dollar mark all the way back in 2013. Scarcely half a decade later, that bubble has leapt to $1.5 trillion. This overhang that&rsquo;s preventing millions of young people from investing in big purchases that create jobs in construction, manufacturing, and other sectors has already reached crisis levels of drag on the economy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe in helping borrowers along the way with incremental policy decisions, but ultimately the system is so corrupt and bureaucratic that it&rsquo;s similar to health care, where you just need a new system,&rdquo; Abrams said.</p>\n<p>Instead of making college a bit cheaper or making loans a bit easier to repay, she said, lawmakers should be focusing on how to make college free. A handful of 2020 primary hopefuls in the Democratic party have already staked out territory on this issue. Last week&rsquo;s bribery scam news arguably help make the case for going big instead of tinkering at the margins of the existing system.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard forever that the student loan system is why we have high college costs. But colleges are brands that people are willing to spend millions to get their kids into anyway,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;This arms race between colleges to put a pool in every dorm and a climbing wall in every gym is driving up the cost of college much more than the student loan system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Using the current crisis to undermine lending programs and push borrowers into the predatory arms of private education-finance models could undo decades of work undertaken to ameliorate the economic disparities in American higher education.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have to remember why the student loan system get created: So everyone could go to college, not just the rich,&rdquo; Abrams said. &ldquo;I fear we&rsquo;re going back to that system where it&rsquo;s a two-tiered system where only people of means can go to college.&rdquo;</p>",

Virginia Foxx (R-NC) that contained specific plans for reaching several of the policy goals the White House pointed toward.\nThe legislation included a $12,500 annual cap for parent loans to fund dependent children\u2019s undergraduate or graduate degree costs. Even experts who support the general idea that colleges would cut prices in response to a lending cap from Washington say such a figure is too low to work.\n\u201cSome reasonable cap on borrowing definitely makes sense but capping it too low would mean that the private market would have to fill in the gap,\u201d New America higher ed expert Clare McCann said. \u201cThat has implications for equity and access for those students.\u201d\nMcCann said capping loans at a more reasonable level would probably drive down costs for graduate degrees and at for-profit undergraduate programs, as those two categories of institution are more likely to target their pricing based on what the government will fund. But for the vast majority of the higher education student body \u2013 undergrad degree-seekers at public universities \u2013 a cap on lending wouldn\u2019t shift prices at all.\nThe better way to reduce the gap between what families borrow and what kids eventually earn, McCann said, is to drive more direct funding back into state schools. States are putting less money into higher education than they did before the Great Recession, and some kind of matching federal funds incentive to restore those defunct investments would go a lot further toward fixing the cost curve for future graduates.\nBut none of these approaches to the balance of costs and debt for future learners will do anything for the 45 million people who already owe $1.5 trillion on student loans. There are better and worse approaches to reshaping the debt curve for future generations, Abrams said, but policymakers are in danger of whistling past an economy-shrinking graveyard if they don\u2019t also get radical on behalf of existing borrowers.\n\u201cSo many of our policies are focused on new students. Let\u2019s say this proposal helps new borrowers. It doesn\u2019t touch any of the existing borrowers. We need to be doing things for them,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cFull debt forgiveness, or at least partial forgiveness for older loans, is something we can attain.\u201d\nThat kind of debt jubilee could be paid for through higher taxes on the same wealthy families that currently burn millions of dollars to help their kids get into the fanciest schools \u2013 whether through outlandish bribery schemes or more traditional donor patronage.\nBig ideas for tackling the existing debt crisis are unlikely to attach to the Higher Education Act legislative process, however. And as long as lawmakers are focused on the future of high ed funding, the risk remains that they\u2019ll find ways to make things worse down the road.\nThe administration\u2019s policy proposal calls for expanding the Pell Grant system, for example \u2013 but not by restoring funding that\u2019s been cut from the program. Instead, the White House signaled a desire to grant wider access to Pell money for educational providers \u2013 something McCann called \u201can incredibly popular bad idea.\u201d\nThe grants can already be used for educational programs as short as 15 weeks. Proposals circulating in recent years that reflect the vague language of Monday\u2019s policy statement would allow even an 8-week course to tap into Pell funding that was initially intended to prop up low-income students\u2019 access to two- and four-year undergraduate programs with a clearer historical link to sustainable employment and earnings opportunities.\n\u201cA lot of students will be enticed by the notion of an 8-week program that leads to high wages, and that promise won\u2019t be fulfilled,\u201d McCann said. \u201cThey\u2019ll be spending their Pell Grant eligibility down on a program that just won\u2019t offer the kind of opportunity they think they\u2019re signing up for.\u201d\nSuch false promises are simply too tempting to resist for borrowers. For-profit colleges have long marketed their offerings in misleading fashion, aiming their ads at daytime television viewers and targeting their price schedules to extract exactly as much cash as federal lending policies allow. This marketing push could grow even more aggressive if the feds let those same vultures into the Pell vault.\nThis administration is famously cozy with the for-profit education industry. DeVos has already halted or reversed a variety of regulatory efforts from her predecessors that aimed to reshape business models and rein in profiteering by the kinds of companies that made her family\u2019s fortune.\n\u201cWhat Trump and Devos are doing with education is just unwinding the little bit of good that Obama did at the end of his term,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about helping big business and hurting borrowers and students.\u201d\nPotentially kleptocratic policymaking around higher education finance would be ethically troubling even in normal times. But total outstanding student loan debts cracked the trillion-dollar mark all the way back in 2013. Scarcely half a decade later, that bubble has leapt to $1.5 trillion. This overhang that\u2019s preventing millions of young people from investing in big purchases that create jobs in construction, manufacturing, and other sectors has already reached crisis levels of drag on the economy.\n\u201cWe believe in helping borrowers along the way with incremental policy decisions, but ultimately the system is so corrupt and bureaucratic that it\u2019s similar to health care, where you just need a new system,\u201d Abrams said.\nInstead of making college a bit cheaper or making loans a bit easier to repay, she said, lawmakers should be focusing on how to make college free. A handful of 2020 primary hopefuls in the Democratic party have already staked out territory on this issue. Last week\u2019s bribery scam news arguably help make the case for going big instead of tinkering at the margins of the existing system.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard forever that the student loan system is why we have high college costs. But colleges are brands that people are willing to spend millions to get their kids into anyway,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cThis arms race between colleges to put a pool in every dorm and a climbing wall in every gym is driving up the cost of college much more than the student loan system.\u201d\nUsing the current crisis to undermine lending programs and push borrowers into the predatory arms of private education-finance models could undo decades of work undertaken to ameliorate the economic disparities in American higher education.\n\u201cWe have to remember why the student loan system get created: So everyone could go to college, not just the rich,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI fear we\u2019re going back to that system where it\u2019s a two-tiered system where only people of means can go to college.\u201d",

CREDIT: Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A new study and a new book both argue that the worst-case scenario for global warming would literally render the planet uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>The book is entitled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Uninhabitable-Earth-Life-After-Warming/dp/0525576703/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=uninhabitable+earth&qid=1551195255&s=gateway&sr=8-1\">The Uninhabitable Earth</a>: Life After Warming&rdquo; and is written by New York Magazine editor David Wallace-Wells; it is an expansion of his controversial viral article published in July 2017 with the same title. As of Feb. 26, it is number 11 on the Amazon best-seller list &mdash; a rarity for any climate book, but perhaps another sign of the growing interest in strong climate action.</p>\n<p>The book, published just last week, makes the case that without dramatic climate action, we are headed for catastrophic warming of 7&deg;F (4&deg;C) above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 &mdash; a world of ever-worsening megadroughts and endless food shortages.</p>\n<p>But, as Wallace-Wells warns, even the unlikely worst-case warming scenario of 14.4&deg;F (8&deg;C) is possible if we keep on a path of high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions &mdash; and if the climate response is at the high end of the estimated range. Warming of this magnitude would essentially render the world uninhabitable, where little arable land survives and the oceans eventually rise more than 200 feet.</p>\n<p><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/6a3f63e8-3d5b-499e-a27e-15e88ecb4603/1.jpg?mode=crop&width=840&height=473\"></img></figure></a></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://i.connatix.com/s3/connatix-uploads/e9803cf5-0e3e-412e-9de7-0b2492c2eb9d/7894.jpg?mode=stretch&connatiximg=true&scale=both&height=394&width=700\"></img></figure>\n<p>Meanwhile, a new study published Monday in <em>Nature Geoscience</em> led by NASA senior scientist Tapio Schneider looks at one way that the worst-case scenario could get much worse.</p>\n<p>The study looks at what happens if we triple <a href=\"https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/high-cosub2sub-levels-can-destabilize-marine-layer-clouds\">atmospheric CO2 concentrations</a> to 1200 parts per million (ppm) from their current level of 410 ppm. This is unlikely, but still possible given current rates of emissions, especially if we trigger key amplifying feedbacks &mdash; such as the release of vast quantities of CO2 from the melting Arctic permafrost.</p>\n<p>In such a world, warming might be expected to be 11&deg;F (6&deg;C) or even 14.4&deg;F (8&deg;C). But the new study finds that at 1200 ppm, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/stratocumulus-clouds\">stratocumulus clouds (which are similar to fog</a>) that help cool the planet &ldquo;become unstable and disappear, triggering a spike in global warming&rdquo; that would add a further stunning 14.4&deg;F (8&deg;C) of global warming.</p>\n<p>The study explains that stratocumulus clouds &ldquo;cover about 20 percent of subtropical oceans&rdquo; especially the eastern portion off the coasts of California or Peru. These clouds &ldquo;cool and shade the earth as they reflect the sunlight that hits them back into space.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Losing them would likely bring total warming beyond 25&deg;F (14&deg;C), a truly uninhabitable earth.</p>\n<p>This scenario may seem impossible, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that in the early Eocene, 52-56 million years ago, the Earth&rsquo;s temperature was in that range &mdash; both the Arctic and Antarctic were ice-free &mdash; and CO2 levels in the air were only in the range of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171012103737.htm\">1000</a> to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17423\">1400</a> ppm.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the study itself points out this so-called previous &ldquo;Hothouse Earth&rdquo; millions of years ago may have been driven in part by a loss of stratocumulus clouds &mdash; and that it could happen again &ldquo;in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The study&rsquo;s findings are just one look at this dangerous feedback loop, and some scientists argue more work needs to be done to examine the likelihood of this scenario. This is because climate models are complex, particularly when it comes to clouds.</p>\n<p>Commenting on the study, leading climate expert Michael Mann told ThinkProgress in an email that, &ldquo;The findings are plausible. Tapio Schneider is not a scientist to be dismissed lightly.&rdquo; But he noted that, &ldquo;Even if the findings are correct (and that would require replication by several independent research teams), this threshold is only hit at 1200 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Finally, Mann warned (original emphasis), &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to get ANYWHERE NEAR 1200 ppm CO2.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And reaching carbon dioxide levels well below that would still trigger catastrophic consequences. He explained that just 7&deg;F (4&deg;C) of warming &ldquo;would constitute the end of civilization as we know it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It can be difficult, however, to fully grasp the scale of warming when dealing with what feels like abstract numbers. Indeed, one of Wallace-Wells&rsquo; points is that &ldquo;because the numbers are so small, we tend to trivialize the differences between one degree [Celsius] of warming and two, two degrees and four.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So Wallace-Wells tries to make what seems trivial and abstract as concrete and visceral as possible with chapter titles such as: &ldquo;Heat Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hunger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drowning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wildfire,&rdquo; &ldquo;Unbreathable Air,&rdquo; &ldquo;Plagues of Warming,&rdquo; &ldquo;Economic Collapse,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Climate Conflict.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And halfway through the book he says, in all caps, &ldquo;If you have made it this far, you are a brave reader.&rdquo; He admits that any of those chapters contains, &ldquo;enough horror to induce a panic attack in even the most optimistic of those considering it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But, he adds, the science makes clear that &ldquo;You are not merely considering it; you are about to embark on living it. In many places, we already are.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In recent years, the science has underscored two key facts that further support this point. First, the climate impacts that come from just one more degree Celsius of warming &mdash; for a total of 3.6&deg;F (2&deg;C) warming &mdash; will be catastrophic.</p>\n<p>Second, the climate system has many feedback loops that threaten to accelerate warming if we trigger them.</p>\n<p>One major<a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/why-trumps-reelection-may-lead-to-a-climate-death-spiral-136fcf81c1b7/\"> 2018 study by 16 top climate scientists</a>, for instance, concluded that if we warm the planet 2&deg;C that may be enough to trigger feedbacks that push the planet toward the irreversible &ldquo;Hothouse Earth.&rdquo; That would mean catastrophic warming of 9&deg;F (5&deg;C) or more, with widespread dust bowls and rapid sea level rise.</p>\n<p>However you describe it, the science makes it increasingly clear that no rational species would allow us to get anywhere near that level of warming. And that&rsquo;s precisely what makes strong action in the next decade, as envisioned in proposals such as the Green New Deal, a moral imperative.</p>",

                "text": "A new study and a new book both argue that the worst-case scenario for global warming would literally render the planet uninhabitable.\nThe book is entitled \u201cThe Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming\u201d and is written by New York Magazine editor David Wallace-Wells; it is an expansion of his controversial viral article published in July 2017 with the same title. As of Feb. 26, it is number 11 on the Amazon best-seller list \u2014 a rarity for any climate book, but perhaps another sign of the growing interest in strong climate action.\nThe book, published just last week, makes the case that without dramatic climate action, we are headed for catastrophic warming of 7\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 \u2014 a world of ever-worsening megadroughts and endless food shortages.\nBut, as Wallace-Wells warns, even the unlikely worst-case warming scenario of 14.4\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) is possible if we keep on a path of high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions \u2014 and if the climate response is at the high end of the estimated range. Warming of this magnitude would essentially render the world uninhabitable, where little arable land survives and the oceans eventually rise more than 200 feet.\nMeanwhile, a new study published Monday in Nature Geoscience led by NASA senior scientist Tapio Schneider looks at one way that the worst-case scenario could get much worse.\nThe study looks at what happens if we triple atmospheric CO2 concentrations to 1200 parts per million (ppm) from their current level of 410 ppm. This is unlikely, but still possible given current rates of emissions, especially if we trigger key amplifying feedbacks \u2014 such as the release of vast quantities of CO2 from the melting Arctic permafrost.\nIn such a world, warming might be expected to be 11\u00b0F (6\u00b0C) or even 14.4\u00b0F (8\u00b0C). But the new study finds that at 1200 ppm, stratocumulus clouds (which are similar to fog) that help cool the planet \u201cbecome unstable and disappear, triggering a spike in global warming\u201d that would add a further stunning 14.4\u00b0F (8\u00b0C) of global warming.\nThe study explains that stratocumulus clouds \u201ccover about 20 percent of subtropical oceans\u201d especially the eastern portion off the coasts of California or Peru. These clouds \u201ccool and shade the earth as they reflect the sunlight that hits them back into space.\u201d\nLosing them would likely bring total warming beyond 25\u00b0F (14\u00b0C), a truly uninhabitable earth.\nThis scenario may seem impossible, but it\u2019s worth noting that in the early Eocene, 52-56 million years ago, the Earth\u2019s temperature was in that range \u2014 both the Arctic and Antarctic were ice-free \u2014 and CO2 levels in the air were only in the range of 1000 to 1400 ppm.\nIndeed, the study itself points out this so-called previous \u201cHothouse Earth\u201d millions of years ago may have been driven in part by a loss of stratocumulus clouds \u2014 and that it could happen again \u201cin the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.\u201d\nThe study\u2019s findings are just one look at this dangerous feedback loop, and some scientists argue more work needs to be done to examine the likelihood of this scenario. This is because climate models are complex, particularly when it comes to clouds.\nCommenting on the study, leading climate expert Michael Mann told ThinkProgress in an email that, \u201cThe findings are plausible. Tapio Schneider is not a scientist to be dismissed lightly.\u201d But he noted that, \u201cEven if the findings are correct (and that would require replication by several independent research teams), this threshold is only hit at 1200 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere.\u201d\nFinally, Mann warned (original emphasis), \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to get ANYWHERE NEAR 1200 ppm CO2.\u201d\nAnd reaching carbon dioxide levels well below that would still trigger catastrophic consequences. He explained that just 7\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) of warming \u201cwould constitute the end of civilization as we know it.\u201d\nIt can be difficult, however, to fully grasp the scale of warming when dealing with what feels like abstract numbers. Indeed, one of Wallace-Wells\u2019 points is that \u201cbecause the numbers are so small, we tend to trivialize the differences between one degree [Celsius] of warming and two, two degrees and four.\u201d\nSo Wallace-Wells tries to make what seems trivial and abstract as concrete and visceral as possible with chapter titles such as: \u201cHeat Death,\u201d \u201cHunger,\u201d \u201cDrowning,\u201d \u201cWildfire,\u201d \u201cUnbreathable Air,\u201d \u201cPlagues of Warming,\u201d \u201cEconomic Collapse,\u201d and \u201cClimate Conflict.\u201d\nAnd halfway through the book he says, in all caps, \u201cIf you have made it this far, you are a brave reader.\u201d He admits that any of those chapters contains, \u201cenough horror to induce a panic attack in even the most optimistic of those considering it.\u201d\nBut, he adds, the science makes clear that \u201cYou are not merely considering it; you are about to embark on living it. In many places, we already are.\u201d\nIn recent years, the science has underscored two key facts that further support this point. First, the climate impacts that come from just one more degree Celsius of warming \u2014 for a total of 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) warming \u2014 will be catastrophic.\nSecond, the climate system has many feedback loops that threaten to accelerate warming if we trigger them.\nOne major 2018 study by 16 top climate scientists, for instance, concluded that if we warm the planet 2\u00b0C that may be enough to trigger feedbacks that push the planet toward the irreversible \u201cHothouse Earth.\u201d That would mean catastrophic warming of 9\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) or more, with widespread dust bowls and rapid sea level rise.\nHowever you describe it, the science makes it increasingly clear that no rational species would allow us to get anywhere near that level of warming. And that\u2019s precisely what makes strong action in the next decade, as envisioned in proposals such as the Green New Deal, a moral imperative.",

Everybody was looking to see how we handled it,&rdquo; a government official said, of the country&lsquo;s treatment of online deception in its elections. &ldquo;We set a precedent and may be a model.&rdquo;</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Earlier this year, Hanan Melcer, the chairman of Israel&rsquo;s Central Elections Committee and a veteran justice on the Supreme Court, summoned representatives from major U.S. social-media and technology companies for talks about the role he expected them to play in curbing online deception during the country&rsquo;s election, which took place on Tuesday. Facebook and Google sent representatives to meet with Melcer in person. Twitter executives, who weren&rsquo;t in the country, arranged for a conference call. &ldquo;You say you&rsquo;ve learned from 2016,&rdquo; Melcer told them, according to a government official who was present. &ldquo;Prove it!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When Melcer, two years ago, assumed his role overseeing the election, he expected that covert influence campaigns by foreign adversaries, similar to Russia&rsquo;s alleged interference during the 2016 U.S. Presidential race, could be his biggest challenge. But, as Melcer and his colleagues looked more closely into the issues they could face, they realized that the problem was broader than foreign interference. Russia&rsquo;s campaign in the United States demonstrated that fake personas on social media could influence events. In Israel and elsewhere, political parties and their allies realized that they could use similar techniques to spread anonymous messages on the Internet and on social media to promote their candidates and undermine their rivals.</p>\n<p>The use of fake online personas has a long history in Israel. In the mid-two-thousands, an Israeli company called Terrogence used them to infiltrate suspected jihadi chat rooms. Later, Terrogence experimented with covertly influencing the jihadis they targeted. More recently, companies in Israel and elsewhere started using fake personas to spread <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/private-mossad-for-hire\">messages</a> on behalf of political parties and their allies.</p>\n<p>Laws governing Israeli election campaigns, which date back, in their original form, to the late nineteen-fifties, bar political parties from disseminating messages anonymously in print, on the radio, and on television. But the laws were never updated to cover messages disseminated online.</p>\n<p>Around the world, countries have addressed social-media manipulation in different ways and with varying degrees of urgency. U.S. lawmakers have criticized Facebook, Twitter, and other major social-media companies for allowing Russian misinformation to proliferate on their platforms. But Congress has taken few steps to address the issue, wary of impinging on free-speech protections.</p>\n<p>An early proponent of modernizing Israel&rsquo;s election laws was Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a law professor and senior researcher with the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute. In 2018, some of her recommendations found their way into draft legislation, which called for banning political parties from disseminating anonymous messages via the Internet or social media. &ldquo;I was very satisfied. It was full circle for me,&rdquo; Altshuler told me in a phone call last week. Then, in October, shortly after the legislation began circulating, a legal adviser in the Knesset told Altshuler that the legislation had been blocked by the party of Prime Minister <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>. &ldquo;It was stopped by Likud,&rdquo; Altshuler recalled. An official with the centrist Yesh Atid party, led by Yair Lapid, a prominent former television journalist, confirmed the role of Likud in blocking the legislation, which Lapid supported. &ldquo;Netanyahu put the brakes on it at the last moment,&rdquo; a Yesh Atid official told me. Likud officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>Lapid has been one of Netanyahu&rsquo;s most formidable political challengers and, in the run-up to Tuesday&rsquo;s election, was a frequent target of anonymous online attacks, which his aides attributed to rival political parties. This past September, Lapid met with Israel&rsquo;s President, Reuven Rivlin, and urged him to use the influence of his office to convince all of the country&rsquo;s political parties to agree to a voluntary moratorium on anonymous campaign messaging. One of the President&rsquo;s aides told me that Rivlin was already aware of the problem. Shortly after his meeting with Lapid, Rivlin issued a public appeal. &ldquo;I expect the heads of the parties themselves to commit to a fair election campaign. This commitment should be evident in the content and tone of their statements, and in excluding those who attempt to distort our judgment and warp our perception of reality. We do not want Israeli bots. We Israelis want to hear opinions and facts,&rdquo; Rivlin said.</p>\n<p>Within the Israeli system, Rivlin has moral authority but few executive powers. His appeal was non-binding, and it quickly became clear that the parties would not agree to a voluntary moratorium unless all the parties were on board, particularly Likud, which rebuffed the idea. Lapid&rsquo;s proposal went nowhere.</p>\n<p>Melcer knew little about cyber threats to voting machines, or about the role of social media and the Internet in modern information warfare, when, in April, 2017, his colleagues on the fifteen-member Supreme Court unanimously nominated him to chair the Elections Committee.</p>\n<p>Melcer, who is sixty-eight, has never had a social-media account. (Israeli rules prevent sitting justices from having them, a government official said.) His first major decision as chairman of the Central Elections Committee, in late 2017, was to reject a proposal to deploy, in limited numbers, computerized voting machines, citing concerns that the systems could be vulnerable to hackers.</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d02c564bcdfff02ebaeeb9b/c9957449-fc35-4fe6-9446-1503b30d3f7chigh.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_1744434749\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5d02c564bcdfff02ebaeeb9b/c9957449-fc35-4fe6-9446-1503b30d3f7cthumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH Could Overtime Larry Change the Game of Teen Hoops?

The disparate organizations, by tradition, do not readily co&ouml;rdinate with one another, though efforts have been made recently to change that dynamic. Israel&rsquo;s more centralized system of using senior Supreme Court justices to administer elections dates back to the country&rsquo;s founding. Melcer, who is required to retire from the court in two years, when he turns seventy, can afford to take controversial positions, unlike politicians and ordinary government officials who are less independent.</p>\n<p>Shachar Ben Meir, an Israeli lawyer who specializes in bringing class-action cases, a couple of which have targeted Facebook, was disappointed that Likud had blocked the passage of legislation to update the country&rsquo;s transparency laws to include campaign activities using the Internet and social media. In January, he and a partner at his law firm, Isaac Aviram, filed a petition with Melcer, arguing that he should simply &ldquo;apply these very old laws to a new situation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, in a Knesset hearing room, Melcer presented representatives from Israel&rsquo;s political parties with an ultimatum: they could either reach an agreement among themselves not to conduct covert campaigns on the Internet and social media, or he would consider banning the practice, unilaterally, through Election Day. Violators could be held in contempt of court and fined. &ldquo;You know what? If you sign the informal agreement, it would make life easier for all sides. I will not have to give a ruling and you will have some standards to implement before the election,&rdquo; Melcer said, according to Altshuler, who was present.</p>\n<p>All but one of Israel&rsquo;s political parties said they would accept the proposed restrictions. &ldquo;Except for Likud, they all said, &lsquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re O.K. with this,&rsquo; &rdquo; Ben Meir told me. Likud argued that Melcer did not have the authority to impose a decision, and that only the Knesset could change the rules.</p>\n<p>Melcer had come up with the idea of the ban after reading various books about free speech in the Internet age, including a 2016 work by Eric Barendt, an emeritus professor of law at University College London. (Reached by phone, Barendt said he had never spoken to Melcer and was unaware, until I called him, that his book had played a role in the Israeli elections.)</p>",

                "text": "Earlier this year, Hanan Melcer, the chairman of Israel\u2019s Central Elections Committee and a veteran justice on the Supreme Court, summoned representatives from major U.S. social-media and technology companies for talks about the role he expected them to play in curbing online deception during the country\u2019s election, which took place on Tuesday. Facebook and Google sent representatives to meet with Melcer in person. Twitter executives, who weren\u2019t in the country, arranged for a conference call. \u201cYou say you\u2019ve learned from 2016,\u201d Melcer told them, according to a government official who was present. \u201cProve it!\u201d\nWhen Melcer, two years ago, assumed his role overseeing the election, he expected that covert influence campaigns by foreign adversaries, similar to Russia\u2019s alleged interference during the 2016 U.S. Presidential race, could be his biggest challenge. But, as Melcer and his colleagues looked more closely into the issues they could face, they realized that the problem was broader than foreign interference. Russia\u2019s campaign in the United States demonstrated that fake personas on social media could influence events. In Israel and elsewhere, political parties and their allies realized that they could use similar techniques to spread anonymous messages on the Internet and on social media to promote their candidates and undermine their rivals.\nThe use of fake online personas has a long history in Israel. In the mid-two-thousands, an Israeli company called Terrogence used them to infiltrate suspected jihadi chat rooms. Later, Terrogence experimented with covertly influencing the jihadis they targeted. More recently, companies in Israel and elsewhere started using fake personas to spread messages on behalf of political parties and their allies.\nLaws governing Israeli election campaigns, which date back, in their original form, to the late nineteen-fifties, bar political parties from disseminating messages anonymously in print, on the radio, and on television. But the laws were never updated to cover messages disseminated online.\nAround the world, countries have addressed social-media manipulation in different ways and with varying degrees of urgency. U.S. lawmakers have criticized Facebook, Twitter, and other major social-media companies for allowing Russian misinformation to proliferate on their platforms. But Congress has taken few steps to address the issue, wary of impinging on free-speech protections.\nAn early proponent of modernizing Israel\u2019s election laws was Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a law professor and senior researcher with the nonpartisan Israel Democracy Institute. In 2018, some of her recommendations found their way into draft legislation, which called for banning political parties from disseminating anonymous messages via the Internet or social media. \u201cI was very satisfied. It was full circle for me,\u201d Altshuler told me in a phone call last week. Then, in October, shortly after the legislation began circulating, a legal adviser in the Knesset told Altshuler that the legislation had been blocked by the party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cIt was stopped by Likud,\u201d Altshuler recalled. An official with the centrist Yesh Atid party, led by Yair Lapid, a prominent former television journalist, confirmed the role of Likud in blocking the legislation, which Lapid supported. \u201cNetanyahu put the brakes on it at the last moment,\u201d a Yesh Atid official told me. Likud officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nLapid has been one of Netanyahu\u2019s most formidable political challengers and, in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election, was a frequent target of anonymous online attacks, which his aides attributed to rival political parties. This past September, Lapid met with Israel\u2019s President, Reuven Rivlin, and urged him to use the influence of his office to convince all of the country\u2019s political parties to agree to a voluntary moratorium on anonymous campaign messaging. One of the President\u2019s aides told me that Rivlin was already aware of the problem. Shortly after his meeting with Lapid, Rivlin issued a public appeal. \u201cI expect the heads of the parties themselves to commit to a fair election campaign. This commitment should be evident in the content and tone of their statements, and in excluding those who attempt to distort our judgment and warp our perception of reality. We do not want Israeli bots. We Israelis want to hear opinions and facts,\u201d Rivlin said.\nWithin the Israeli system, Rivlin has moral authority but few executive powers. His appeal was non-binding, and it quickly became clear that the parties would not agree to a voluntary moratorium unless all the parties were on board, particularly Likud, which rebuffed the idea. Lapid\u2019s proposal went nowhere.\nMelcer knew little about cyber threats to voting machines, or about the role of social media and the Internet in modern information warfare, when, in April, 2017, his colleagues on the fifteen-member Supreme Court unanimously nominated him to chair the Elections Committee.\nMelcer, who is sixty-eight, has never had a social-media account. (Israeli rules prevent sitting justices from having them, a government official said.) His first major decision as chairman of the Central Elections Committee, in late 2017, was to reject a proposal to deploy, in limited numbers, computerized voting machines, citing concerns that the systems could be vulnerable to hackers.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH Could Overtime Larry Change the Game of Teen Hoops?

The disparate organizations, by tradition, do not readily co\u00f6rdinate with one another, though efforts have been made recently to change that dynamic. Israel\u2019s more centralized system of using senior Supreme Court justices to administer elections dates back to the country\u2019s founding. Melcer, who is required to retire from the court in two years, when he turns seventy, can afford to take controversial positions, unlike politicians and ordinary government officials who are less independent.\nShachar Ben Meir, an Israeli lawyer who specializes in bringing class-action cases, a couple of which have targeted Facebook, was disappointed that Likud had blocked the passage of legislation to update the country\u2019s transparency laws to include campaign activities using the Internet and social media. In January, he and a partner at his law firm, Isaac Aviram, filed a petition with Melcer, arguing that he should simply \u201capply these very old laws to a new situation.\u201d\nShortly thereafter, in a Knesset hearing room, Melcer presented representatives from Israel\u2019s political parties with an ultimatum: they could either reach an agreement among themselves not to conduct covert campaigns on the Internet and social media, or he would consider banning the practice, unilaterally, through Election Day. Violators could be held in contempt of court and fined. \u201cYou know what? If you sign the informal agreement, it would make life easier for all sides. I will not have to give a ruling and you will have some standards to implement before the election,\u201d Melcer said, according to Altshuler, who was present.\nAll but one of Israel\u2019s political parties said they would accept the proposed restrictions. \u201cExcept for Likud, they all said, \u2018Yes, we\u2019re O.K. with this,\u2019 \u201d Ben Meir told me. Likud argued that Melcer did not have the authority to impose a decision, and that only the Knesset could change the rules.\nMelcer had come up with the idea of the ban after reading various books about free speech in the Internet age, including a 2016 work by Eric Barendt, an emeritus professor of law at University College London. (Reached by phone, Barendt said he had never spoken to Melcer and was unaware, until I called him, that his book had played a role in the Israeli elections.)",

Video of the arrest revealed a man withered by a lengthy and increasingly severe isolation. His face was bloated and pale, his beard frayed, his silvery hair long and pulled back. With four policemen hustling his hunched body onto the street, Assange protested the admission of British officers to Ecuadorian diplomatic territory. &ldquo;The U.K. has no sovereignty!&rdquo; he declared repeatedly. His voice was hoarse and weakened. He appeared to be clutching Gore Vidal&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the National Security State.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Assange&rsquo;s presence in the Ecuadorian Embassy was never tenable in the long run. He had arrived there to request asylum, in the spring of 2012, disguised as a motorcycle deliveryman to evade detection. At the time, he was being investigated in Sweden for rape and molestation, and he had lost a protracted fight in the British courts to resist his extradition to Stockholm for questioning. Justifying his asylum, Assange argued that the Swedish government merely wanted him on a pretext&mdash;that its real intention all along was to deliver him to the United States for prosecution, or, worse, to allow the C.I.A. to render him to a black site, like an Al Qaeda detainee. As I noted in a <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country\">Profile of Assange</a> that I wrote in 2017, that argument, repeated by his supporters, never made much sense. The United States and the United Kingdom have well-oiled joint-extradition machinery. It was working very well this morning.</p>\n<p>The conspiracy theory that a Swedish prosecutor was necessary to apprehend Assange can now die. What will linger as a topic of debate, however, is the core of Assange&rsquo;s asylum argument: that delivering him to America to face trial is akin to forcing a Cambodian refugee, fleeing the Khmer Rouge into Thailand, to return across the border and face grave harm. There is a principle in international law, called non-refoulement, that asserts that it is unlawful to compel asylum seekers and refugees to return to jurisdictions where they will suffer cruel and inhuman treatment. This argument, as Assange and his supporters have adapted it to his case, assumes not only that indicting him is unjust but also that the American judicial process is so broken that a trial can <em>only</em> result in persecution.</p>\n<p>Assange and his supporters have long speculated that he might be charged in the U.S. under the Espionage Act&mdash;a poorly written law that, if applied to his case, would set a precedent that could have a chilling effect on all of journalism. The Obama Administration, concerned about the implications for press freedoms, declined to prosecute him under the act. (It also allowed a hacking investigation against WikiLeaks to stall without bringing charges against the organization.) The indictment issued by Trump&rsquo;s Department of Justice is instead based on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act&mdash;essentially, for a hacking-related conspiracy. The core allegation is derived from a thirteen-page document introduced as evidence during <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/chelsea-manning\">Chelsea Manning</a>&rsquo;s court-martial, in 2012, and known to U.S. authorities for years. The document records encrypted instant messages between Assange and Manning in March, 2010, after she had downloaded tens of thousands of records from a secure military network, the <em>SIPRNET</em>, and uploaded them to WikiLeaks. Amid some casual banter, Manning mentioned a hash value, an alphanumeric representation that can be used to derive a password, and asked Assange if he could break one.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Any good at lm hash cracking?&rdquo; she asked.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Assange wrote.</p>\n<p>Minutes later, she sent him the hash value, &ldquo;80c11049faebf441d524fb3c4cd5351c,&rdquo; but indicated that she was unsure what it was precisely for. Even though it would take considerable effort and computing power to crack, Assange responded, unconcerned, &ldquo;I passed it to our guy.&rdquo; He may have done what he said. He may also have been blustering&mdash;giving a key source the impression that WikiLeaks was more sophisticated than it really was. In my own dealings with Assange, he has often overstated his abilities as a hacker; he is a self-confessed dissembler.</p>\n<figure><figure> <video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"http://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video><iframe src=\"https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.365.1_en.html#goog_925358568\"></iframe><video src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087thumbs.mp4\"></video> WATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More... <h4>EMBED URL</h4>&lt;script async src=&quot;//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<h4>VIDEO URL</h4>https://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/ <img src=\"https://dp8hsntg6do36.cloudfront.net/5dfb972634e7945990dec215/e4c62a19-5bfb-4fd1-ba95-8421dc1c4087high.mp4?videoIndex=0&requester=oo\"></img> <h4>This live video has ended.

                "text": "A long, strange chapter in the story of WikiLeaks ended this morning, when London\u2019s Metropolitan Police arrived at the Ecuadorian Embassy to forcibly put Julian Assange in handcuffs and usher him into an armored vehicle. Video of the arrest revealed a man withered by a lengthy and increasingly severe isolation. His face was bloated and pale, his beard frayed, his silvery hair long and pulled back. With four policemen hustling his hunched body onto the street, Assange protested the admission of British officers to Ecuadorian diplomatic territory. \u201cThe U.K. has no sovereignty!\u201d he declared repeatedly. His voice was hoarse and weakened. He appeared to be clutching Gore Vidal\u2019s \u201cHistory of the National Security State.\u201d\nAssange\u2019s presence in the Ecuadorian Embassy was never tenable in the long run. He had arrived there to request asylum, in the spring of 2012, disguised as a motorcycle deliveryman to evade detection. At the time, he was being investigated in Sweden for rape and molestation, and he had lost a protracted fight in the British courts to resist his extradition to Stockholm for questioning. Justifying his asylum, Assange argued that the Swedish government merely wanted him on a pretext\u2014that its real intention all along was to deliver him to the United States for prosecution, or, worse, to allow the C.I.A. to render him to a black site, like an Al Qaeda detainee. As I noted in a Profile of Assange that I wrote in 2017, that argument, repeated by his supporters, never made much sense. The United States and the United Kingdom have well-oiled joint-extradition machinery. It was working very well this morning.\nThe conspiracy theory that a Swedish prosecutor was necessary to apprehend Assange can now die. What will linger as a topic of debate, however, is the core of Assange\u2019s asylum argument: that delivering him to America to face trial is akin to forcing a Cambodian refugee, fleeing the Khmer Rouge into Thailand, to return across the border and face grave harm. There is a principle in international law, called non-refoulement, that asserts that it is unlawful to compel asylum seekers and refugees to return to jurisdictions where they will suffer cruel and inhuman treatment. This argument, as Assange and his supporters have adapted it to his case, assumes not only that indicting him is unjust but also that the American judicial process is so broken that a trial can only result in persecution.\nAssange and his supporters have long speculated that he might be charged in the U.S. under the Espionage Act\u2014a poorly written law that, if applied to his case, would set a precedent that could have a chilling effect on all of journalism. The Obama Administration, concerned about the implications for press freedoms, declined to prosecute him under the act. (It also allowed a hacking investigation against WikiLeaks to stall without bringing charges against the organization.) The indictment issued by Trump\u2019s Department of Justice is instead based on the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act\u2014essentially, for a hacking-related conspiracy. The core allegation is derived from a thirteen-page document introduced as evidence during Chelsea Manning\u2019s court-martial, in 2012, and known to U.S. authorities for years. The document records encrypted instant messages between Assange and Manning in March, 2010, after she had downloaded tens of thousands of records from a secure military network, the SIPRNET, and uploaded them to WikiLeaks. Amid some casual banter, Manning mentioned a hash value, an alphanumeric representation that can be used to derive a password, and asked Assange if he could break one.\n\u201cAny good at lm hash cracking?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Assange wrote.\nMinutes later, she sent him the hash value, \u201c80c11049faebf441d524fb3c4cd5351c,\u201d but indicated that she was unsure what it was precisely for. Even though it would take considerable effort and computing power to crack, Assange responded, unconcerned, \u201cI passed it to our guy.\u201d He may have done what he said. He may also have been blustering\u2014giving a key source the impression that WikiLeaks was more sophisticated than it really was. In my own dealings with Assange, he has often overstated his abilities as a hacker; he is a self-confessed dissembler.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWATCH President Trump Is Impeached Share Tweet Email More...\nEMBED URL\n<script async src=\"//player-backend.cnevids.com/script/video/5dfb972634e7945990dec215.js?iu=/3379/newyorker.dart/share\"></script>\nVIDEO URL\nhttps://video.newyorker.com/watch/president-trump-is-impeached/\nThis live video has ended.

But one irony is easy to discern: Assange clearly believed that a Donald J. Trump Presidency would benefit him, and yet it was the Trump Administration that sought to redefine WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service\u201d\u2014an organization that did not belong within the ambit of journalism. Assange, a devoted opponent of what he describes as American imperial power, has welcomed Trump\u2019s degradation of U.S. norms and institutions. Now his fate will be determined by the health of those same institutions.

Case in point: Norwegian Air has already made clear it expects Boeing to write it a check at the end of all this.\ntheSkimm\nBoeing is a leader in the aircraft industry \u2013 both with commercial planes (like the 737 Max) and military planes. This safety crisis is a huge liability for the brand. And it's making people take a closer look at this billion-dollar industry to make sure that safety in the skies is the number one priority.\nSkimm More: We've got your Skimm on what airlines do to prevent crashes, what you can do as a consumer, and more.\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

Four people were <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2O3asW0\">taken into custody</a> &ndash; three men and one woman &ndash; but authorities said that only three are believed to have been involved. One man in his late 20s was later charged with murder and expected to appear in court tomorrow morning. Police say they also intercepted two explosive devices found on a car.</p>\n<h3>Do we know why this happened?</h3>\n<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it a terrorist attack and &quot;an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.&quot; She alluded to anti-immigrant motivation, saying many directly affected may be migrants and refugees. One man who apparently <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2O3bocY\">claimed responsibility</a> &ndash; and live streamed the attack &ndash; left behind a white nationalist, anti-immigrant manifesto. All schools there were placed on lockdown. Police are urging people to stay away from mosques around the country.</p>\n<h3>Have mass shootings happened before in New Zealand?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but they're rare. The last one happened in 1990 and left 13 people dead. It led to tighter gun laws in the country, restricting access to semiautomatic weapons. Gun owners must have a license and go through intense background checks, including an at-home visit to make sure the weapon is properly and safely stored.</p>\n<h3>How are people responding?</h3>\n<p>Multiple state leaders or diplomats have shared their sympathies and solidarity with the victims and their families. Some cities in the US have beefed up security around mosques.</p>\n<h2>theSkimm</h2>\n<p>Ardern called this &quot;one of New Zealand's darkest days.&quot;</p>\n<h2>REPEAT AFTER ME...</h2>\n<h3>What people are talking about...</h3>\n<p>Congress pushing back on President Trump. Yesterday, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Jn6Uzw\">overturn</a> Trump's national emergency declaration he announced <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2JddlFe\">last month</a> to get money for his border wall. (Spoiler, he now <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2HnbUlx\">wants more</a>.) But many in Congress &ndash; even those who agree with Trump's border policy &ndash; felt he was overstepping by declaring an emergency to get around Congress. And were worried that by letting this slide, it would set a precedent for future presidents to do the same. So a dozen Republicans sided with Democrats to overturn it. But don't expect this to work: Trump has threatened to veto it &ndash; and <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2O67T5z\">another bill</a> the Senate passed this week to end the US's support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Speaking of the House, yesterday it voted <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2XWr6v0\">420-0</a> to call for special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report to be made public, whenever he decides to drop it (<a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2E6nAq5\">Mueller&hellip;? Mueller&hellip;?</a>). Even though Congress doesn't have the power to force the report to go public, this sent a clear, bipartisan message that the House wants transparency. But it just took <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2VZSTJk\">one person</a> to block it in the Senate.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you keep hearing about Brexit...</h3>\n<p>One more time for good measure. Yesterday, lawmakers in the UK <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2CiiLsE\">voted to delay</a> leaving the EU. Unless you've been sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs, you know PM Theresa May has been trying to figure out how to untangle the UK from the EU. But lawmakers voted her plan down. Twice. Earlier this week, lawmakers voted not to leave the EU without a plan in place for how to do it. Then yesterday, they voted to delay Brexit but ruled out a second Brexit referendum...at least for now. Here's what's next: May will try &ndash; yet again &ndash; to pass her deal. Because third time's the charm. If her plan is agreed on by March 20, she'll ask for the EU to delay Brexit until June 30. If not, May will ask for a longer delay. May's advising against this, because it means the UK would have to participate in European Parliament elections later this year and continue paying in to the EU budget. But a delay &ndash; no matter how long &ndash; will need to be approved by all other 27 EU members. If nothing gets figured out, the UK could end up having a chaotic exit on March 29. Which is in 14 days. Get ready.</p>\n<h3>What has people taking a stance&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Climate change. Today, hundreds of thousands of students <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2T5NU83\">around the world</a> are expected to skip school and call for action on climate change. It all started with Swedish 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Now, people in more than 100 countries are demanding that political leaders address the threats from climate change. And Thunberg has been nominated for the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2W3YcaP\">Nobel Peace Prize</a>. What did you do in high school?</p>\n<h3>What to say when you hear about the class-action lawsuit against colleges involved in the admissions scandal...</h3>\n<p>In other legal news, yesterday the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that families of the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2UDyoC2\">Sandy Hook victims</a> can sue the gun manufacturer behind the AR-15 rifle used in the 2012 school shooting. This could provide a legal opening for other lawsuits against gun manufacturers around the US.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you're craving something sweet&hellip;</h3>\n<p>How about some &pi;? (We had to.) <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2F0uGvE\">NASA</a> was feeling Pi Day (March 14 aka 3/14) and yesterday launched a rocket at 3:14pm ET. Also feeling mathematical: <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TByAoN\">Google employee Emma Haruka Iwao</a>. She set a new world record for calculating pi to 31.4 trillion digits. Easy as pi.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you hear Lilly Singh is coming to late night...</h3>\n<h2>Sign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.</h2>",

                "text": "NEW ZEALAND\nToday, there were gun attacks at two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch, killing at least 49 people and injuring more than 20.\nThe attacks happened during Friday prayers. Four people were taken into custody \u2013 three men and one woman \u2013 but authorities said that only three are believed to have been involved. One man in his late 20s was later charged with murder and expected to appear in court tomorrow morning. Police say they also intercepted two explosive devices found on a car.\nDo we know why this happened?\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called it a terrorist attack and \"an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence.\" She alluded to anti-immigrant motivation, saying many directly affected may be migrants and refugees. One man who apparently claimed responsibility \u2013 and live streamed the attack \u2013 left behind a white nationalist, anti-immigrant manifesto. All schools there were placed on lockdown. Police are urging people to stay away from mosques around the country.\nHave mass shootings happened before in New Zealand?\nYes, but they're rare. The last one happened in 1990 and left 13 people dead. It led to tighter gun laws in the country, restricting access to semiautomatic weapons. Gun owners must have a license and go through intense background checks, including an at-home visit to make sure the weapon is properly and safely stored.\nHow are people responding?\nMultiple state leaders or diplomats have shared their sympathies and solidarity with the victims and their families. Some cities in the US have beefed up security around mosques.\ntheSkimm\nArdern called this \"one of New Zealand's darkest days.\"\nREPEAT AFTER ME...\nWhat people are talking about...\nCongress pushing back on President Trump. Yesterday, the Republican-controlled Senate voted to overturn Trump's national emergency declaration he announced last month to get money for his border wall. (Spoiler, he now wants more.) But many in Congress \u2013 even those who agree with Trump's border policy \u2013 felt he was overstepping by declaring an emergency to get around Congress. And were worried that by letting this slide, it would set a precedent for future presidents to do the same. So a dozen Republicans sided with Democrats to overturn it. But don't expect this to work: Trump has threatened to veto it \u2013 and another bill the Senate passed this week to end the US's support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Speaking of the House, yesterday it voted 420-0 to call for special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report to be made public, whenever he decides to drop it (Mueller\u2026? Mueller\u2026?). Even though Congress doesn't have the power to force the report to go public, this sent a clear, bipartisan message that the House wants transparency. But it just took one person to block it in the Senate.\nWhat to say when you keep hearing about Brexit...\nOne more time for good measure. Yesterday, lawmakers in the UK voted to delay leaving the EU. Unless you've been sleeping in a cupboard under the stairs, you know PM Theresa May has been trying to figure out how to untangle the UK from the EU. But lawmakers voted her plan down. Twice. Earlier this week, lawmakers voted not to leave the EU without a plan in place for how to do it. Then yesterday, they voted to delay Brexit but ruled out a second Brexit referendum...at least for now. Here's what's next: May will try \u2013 yet again \u2013 to pass her deal. Because third time's the charm. If her plan is agreed on by March 20, she'll ask for the EU to delay Brexit until June 30. If not, May will ask for a longer delay. May's advising against this, because it means the UK would have to participate in European Parliament elections later this year and continue paying in to the EU budget. But a delay \u2013 no matter how long \u2013 will need to be approved by all other 27 EU members. If nothing gets figured out, the UK could end up having a chaotic exit on March 29. Which is in 14 days. Get ready.\nWhat has people taking a stance\u2026\nClimate change. Today, hundreds of thousands of students around the world are expected to skip school and call for action on climate change. It all started with Swedish 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Now, people in more than 100 countries are demanding that political leaders address the threats from climate change. And Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. What did you do in high school?\nWhat to say when you hear about the class-action lawsuit against colleges involved in the admissions scandal...\nIn other legal news, yesterday the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that families of the Sandy Hook victims can sue the gun manufacturer behind the AR-15 rifle used in the 2012 school shooting. This could provide a legal opening for other lawsuits against gun manufacturers around the US.\nWhat to say when you're craving something sweet\u2026\nHow about some \u03c0? (We had to.) NASA was feeling Pi Day (March 14 aka 3/14) and yesterday launched a rocket at 3:14pm ET. Also feeling mathematical: Google employee Emma Haruka Iwao. She set a new world record for calculating pi to 31.4 trillion digits. Easy as pi.\nWhat to say when you hear Lilly Singh is coming to late night...\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

                "html": "<p>Days after the deadliest shooting in New Zealand's modern history, its government is <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2udnMxW\">taking up the issue of gun control</a>.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What's the latest news with the shooting?</h4>\n<p>50 people were killed and more than 30 are still in the hospital after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch, NZ. The death toll could've been higher had it not been for <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2HDVDZ1\">Abdul Aziz</a>, a survivor who ran towards the gunshots and confronted the gunman.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Who would do this?</h4>\n<p>The suspect is a 28-year-old white nationalist from Australia. He allegedly posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online &ndash; which was sent to media outlets and the prime minister's office minutes before the attack. He also allegedly live-streamed part of the attack on <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2uctpMT\">Facebook</a> (the company said it had removed 1.5 million versions of the video within the first 24 hours). He's been charged with murder and will be tried in New Zealand. He reportedly fired his lawyer and says he plans to represent himself.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">And how are the families?</h4>\n<p>A preliminary list of the victims has been shared with family members, but authorities there are still trying to identify all of the bodies. Some bodies are being released to families, as officials are aware that <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TOF4A7\">Islamic practice</a> requires burial as early as possible, usually within 24 hours of death. Here's how <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TTxG6s\">you can help</a> the victims and families.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Can this stop, please.</h4>\n<p>PM Jacinda Ardern says her government will announce new gun laws within the next week. In New Zealand, laws are <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2W98ZR5\">more strict</a> than in the US. While many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour after a background check, that process can apparently take weeks or months in New Zealand and includes a home visit from officials to make sure a weapon would be properly stored. But unlike some countries, most guns don't need to be registered there.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">So what else could the gov do?</h4>\n<p>Arden's mentioned that she wants to ban semi-automatic weapons. But the gov may try other options, like creating a gun buyback program, banning private ownership of semi-automatic guns, or requiring more types of guns to be registered. This swift action is showing how different gun culture is in New Zealand than in the US &ndash; where Congress hasn't passed gun control legislation after multiple deadly attacks per year.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Anything else I should know about?</h4>\n<p>Yup. On Friday, an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker made headlines for blaming Muslim immigrants for the attack. Over the weekend, a teenager threw an egg at him while he was talking to reporters. The lawmaker responded by punching the teen. The video of the incident went viral &ndash; and people are calling the lawmaker out for getting physical.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">theSkimm</h4>\n<p>One thing this shooting is exposing is the rising trend of white nationalism around the globe. And the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TSiuGB\">deadly violence that can come with it</a>. There's worry that if this suspect gets to represent himself at trial, it could serve as a platform for these types of views.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What people are talking about&hellip;</h4>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TNPfWx\">This report</a> on Saudi Arabia's efforts to silence critics. It says that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) authorized a secret campaign to crack down on dissidents. Last year, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi &ndash; who's criticized the Saudi gov &ndash; was killed at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. Pretty much everyone pointed the finger at MBS for ordering his killing. The CIA reached the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2JkcSB4\">same conclusion</a>. Saudi Arabia couldn't get its story straight, but always maintained that MBS wasn't behind it. Fast forward a few months later, and we're learning about this campaign. It reportedly started more than a year before Khashoggi's death. And there were at least a dozen other missions carried out, like bringing Saudi dissidents back to the country and torturing them. The Saudi Embassy in DC says it takes the allegations &quot;very seriously.&quot;</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What people are watching&hellip;</h4>\n<p>The aftermath from deadly storms around the world. A recent <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Cr6DFw\">cyclone</a> in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe killed at least 150 people. Hundreds are still missing, and tens of thousands are stranded because of damaged roads. Rescue efforts are underway. Meanwhile, in <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2F7tAhx\">Indonesia</a>, dozens of people were killed because of flash flooding and a landslide. Search and rescue teams are having a hard time reaching some of the affected areas. The <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TNN1Wc\">Midwest</a> also experienced record flooding over the weekend. A bomb cyclone there brought heavy rain and flooding. At least three people have died as a result, and two others are missing.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What your cousin who's studying abroad is texting about&hellip;</h4>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2HpNOXt\">Paris</a>. Things turned violent during the 18th straight weekend of yellow vest protests there. They started in November over a proposed fuel tax hike, but have gradually turned into general anti-gov protests. Over the weekend, protesters set off fires, and damaged stores and restaurants. Dozens of people were injured. France's PM and others met up over the weekend to figure out how to handle this violence. Meanwhile, <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2u9CPsA\">Serbia</a> had its own protests this weekend. Thousands turned out to call for the president to step down. He's been accused of being a dictator with a tight grip on the media. There have been opposition protests going on for more than three months. Over the weekend, thousands took to the streets &ndash; and some stormed the national TV station &ndash; calling on him to hand in his resignation letter and demanding fair elections and a free media.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What to say when your boss asks to see you before you leave on a Friday&hellip;</h4>\n<p>Am I in trouble? Fox News reportedly <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ucFz8E\">suspended</a> host Jeanine Pirro. Last week, she got in hot water for questioning whether Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was loyal to the US and the Constitution because of her religion. Reminder: Omar's one of the first Muslim congresswomen ever. Fox News condemned Pirro's comment, and didn't air her show over the weekend. President Trump wasn't too happy about that. He said that the channel should bring back Pirro &ndash; who's known for defending him. Here's who's also defending Trump: acting chief of staff <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TNqfPb\">Mick Mulvaney</a>. Over the weekend, he said &quot;I don't think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.&quot; This comes as some have wondered whether Trump's rhetoric and policies around white supremacy may have played a role in the New Zealand shooting. And why he hasn't directly condemned white nationalism both in the US and abroad.</p>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2XWXu0C\">QB Johnny Manziel</a> is getting back on the field. The former Heisman Trophy winner signed with the Alliance of American Football (<a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TIg3Hj\">the NFL's new, lesser-known cousin</a>).</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What to say when your roommate says they're gonna go run&hellip;</h4>\n<h2>Sign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.</h2>",

                "text": "Days after the deadliest shooting in New Zealand's modern history, its government is taking up the issue of gun control.\nWhat's the latest news with the shooting?\n50 people were killed and more than 30 are still in the hospital after a gunman opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch, NZ. The death toll could've been higher had it not been for Abdul Aziz, a survivor who ran towards the gunshots and confronted the gunman.\nWho would do this?\nThe suspect is a 28-year-old white nationalist from Australia. He allegedly posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online \u2013 which was sent to media outlets and the prime minister's office minutes before the attack. He also allegedly live-streamed part of the attack on Facebook (the company said it had removed 1.5 million versions of the video within the first 24 hours). He's been charged with murder and will be tried in New Zealand. He reportedly fired his lawyer and says he plans to represent himself.\nAnd how are the families?\nA preliminary list of the victims has been shared with family members, but authorities there are still trying to identify all of the bodies. Some bodies are being released to families, as officials are aware that Islamic practice requires burial as early as possible, usually within 24 hours of death. Here's how you can help the victims and families.\nCan this stop, please.\nPM Jacinda Ardern says her government will announce new gun laws within the next week. In New Zealand, laws are more strict than in the US. While many Americans can buy a gun in less than an hour after a background check, that process can apparently take weeks or months in New Zealand and includes a home visit from officials to make sure a weapon would be properly stored. But unlike some countries, most guns don't need to be registered there.\nSo what else could the gov do?\nArden's mentioned that she wants to ban semi-automatic weapons. But the gov may try other options, like creating a gun buyback program, banning private ownership of semi-automatic guns, or requiring more types of guns to be registered. This swift action is showing how different gun culture is in New Zealand than in the US \u2013 where Congress hasn't passed gun control legislation after multiple deadly attacks per year.\nAnything else I should know about?\nYup. On Friday, an Australian anti-immigration lawmaker made headlines for blaming Muslim immigrants for the attack. Over the weekend, a teenager threw an egg at him while he was talking to reporters. The lawmaker responded by punching the teen. The video of the incident went viral \u2013 and people are calling the lawmaker out for getting physical.\ntheSkimm\nOne thing this shooting is exposing is the rising trend of white nationalism around the globe. And the deadly violence that can come with it. There's worry that if this suspect gets to represent himself at trial, it could serve as a platform for these types of views.\nWhat people are talking about\u2026\nThis report on Saudi Arabia's efforts to silence critics. It says that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) authorized a secret campaign to crack down on dissidents. Last year, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2013 who's criticized the Saudi gov \u2013 was killed at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. Pretty much everyone pointed the finger at MBS for ordering his killing. The CIA reached the same conclusion. Saudi Arabia couldn't get its story straight, but always maintained that MBS wasn't behind it. Fast forward a few months later, and we're learning about this campaign. It reportedly started more than a year before Khashoggi's death. And there were at least a dozen other missions carried out, like bringing Saudi dissidents back to the country and torturing them. The Saudi Embassy in DC says it takes the allegations \"very seriously.\"\nWhat people are watching\u2026\nThe aftermath from deadly storms around the world. A recent cyclone in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe killed at least 150 people. Hundreds are still missing, and tens of thousands are stranded because of damaged roads. Rescue efforts are underway. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, dozens of people were killed because of flash flooding and a landslide. Search and rescue teams are having a hard time reaching some of the affected areas. The Midwest also experienced record flooding over the weekend. A bomb cyclone there brought heavy rain and flooding. At least three people have died as a result, and two others are missing.\nWhat your cousin who's studying abroad is texting about\u2026\nParis. Things turned violent during the 18th straight weekend of yellow vest protests there. They started in November over a proposed fuel tax hike, but have gradually turned into general anti-gov protests. Over the weekend, protesters set off fires, and damaged stores and restaurants. Dozens of people were injured. France's PM and others met up over the weekend to figure out how to handle this violence. Meanwhile, Serbia had its own protests this weekend. Thousands turned out to call for the president to step down. He's been accused of being a dictator with a tight grip on the media. There have been opposition protests going on for more than three months. Over the weekend, thousands took to the streets \u2013 and some stormed the national TV station \u2013 calling on him to hand in his resignation letter and demanding fair elections and a free media.\nWhat to say when your boss asks to see you before you leave on a Friday\u2026\nAm I in trouble? Fox News reportedly suspended host Jeanine Pirro. Last week, she got in hot water for questioning whether Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was loyal to the US and the Constitution because of her religion. Reminder: Omar's one of the first Muslim congresswomen ever. Fox News condemned Pirro's comment, and didn't air her show over the weekend. President Trump wasn't too happy about that. He said that the channel should bring back Pirro \u2013 who's known for defending him. Here's who's also defending Trump: acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Over the weekend, he said \"I don't think anybody could say that the president is anti-Muslim.\" This comes as some have wondered whether Trump's rhetoric and policies around white supremacy may have played a role in the New Zealand shooting. And why he hasn't directly condemned white nationalism both in the US and abroad.\nQB Johnny Manziel is getting back on the field. The former Heisman Trophy winner signed with the Alliance of American Football (the NFL's new, lesser-known cousin).\nWhat to say when your roommate says they're gonna go run\u2026\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

Some spots there were predicted to get at least 18 inches of rain. The storm later made its way to Zimbabwe and Malawi before dissipating. Now we're learning how bad the damage really was.</p>\n<h3>I'm scared to ask...</h3>\n<p>We know at least 215 people were killed within the three countries. But yesterday, Mozambique's president said the death toll in his country alone could be more than 1,000 &ndash; more than 10 times the current death toll (which is at least 84).</p>\n<h3>Why is it taking so long to confirm this?</h3>\n<p>The Red Cross says that the storm destroyed 90% of a major port city in Mozambique called Beira. It cut off roads to the half-million people there, making it difficult for rescue workers to help and assess the damage on the ground. The cyclone knocked out power in the area, caused a dam to burst, and destroyed bridges and homes. It also could lead to food shortages in the region &ndash; since the cyclone apparently ruined the area's farms. It doesn't help that Mozambique is a poor country with a reportedly bad communication and transportation network.</p>\n<h3>Yikes.</h3>\n<p>Yup, and since the city is in such bad shape, we may not find out the final number or the true scale of the damage for a while. Emergency officials say that they think the death toll will drastically go up, but there's no way to know for now if it'll hit the president's estimate.</p>\n<h3>I have to ask...is this related to climate change?</h3>\n<p>Unclear. Cyclones are normal this time of year in the area. But they're becoming more frequent. Cyclones need warm air to form &ndash; and if global temperatures continue to increase, the number of cyclones <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2FmxuVq\">may too</a>.</p>\n<p>The president reportedly says the country is facing a &quot;humanitarian disaster of large proportions.&quot; If the death toll winds up reaching 1,000 or higher in Mozambique, it could be the deadliest storm in the country's history.</p>\n<h2>REPEAT AFTER ME...</h2>\n<h3>What people are thinking about&hellip;</h3>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2CrQgZl\">The Netherlands</a>. Yesterday, a gunman killed three people and wounded five more on a tram in the city of Utrecht (about 25 miles from Amsterdam). Hours after the attack, police arrested a suspect &ndash; a 37-year-old Turkish man with a criminal record. Authorities were treating it as a possible act of terrorism, though it's still unclear what the motive was. A Turkish news agency reported it was part of a family dispute. The attack had people around the world on edge, fearing a possible terrorist attack so soon after the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2O3asW0\">Christchurch shooting</a> in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>I'm listening. The Supreme Court isn't. Yesterday, it said it won't hear the case of a Hawaiian B&amp;B owner who <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ucpbVD\">refused to rent a room</a> to a lesbian couple. In 2007, the owner refused to let the couple stay there because she said it violated her religious beliefs. The couple took the issue to court &ndash; which found that the owner discriminated against them based on their sexual orientation. The owner appealed, and the case made its way up to the Supreme Court. Eyes were on how the court would handle this case, since it sided last year with a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TMW8Hw\">Colorado baker</a> who refused to make a cake for a gay wedding because of his faith. But the Supremes decided to pass on the Hawaiian B&amp;B case &ndash; meaning that the lower court ruling stands. What the Supremes will take up: a case challenging a life-without-parole sentence for one of the convicted <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Cn032U\">Beltway snipers</a> who was underage at the time of his crimes.</p>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Hufhra\">Skimm More</a><strong><em>: </em></strong><em>Yesterday, SCOTUS decided what it is and isn't listening to next term.

The movement started in November over a proposed fuel tax hike, but turned into general protests against the government. And have been going on for 18 weekends in a row. This past weekend, things turned violent and some well-known businesses were damaged or destroyed. Now, the PM is saying 'enough is enough.' And putting a ban on protests in the worst hit neighborhoods. Peaceful and authorized protests are reportedly allowed to continue.

                "text": "CYCLONE IDAI\nThe president of Mozambique warns that the death toll from last week's cyclone could climb to more than 1,000.\nLast Thursday, a cyclone hit the country. Some spots there were predicted to get at least 18 inches of rain. The storm later made its way to Zimbabwe and Malawi before dissipating. Now we're learning how bad the damage really was.\nI'm scared to ask...\nWe know at least 215 people were killed within the three countries. But yesterday, Mozambique's president said the death toll in his country alone could be more than 1,000 \u2013 more than 10 times the current death toll (which is at least 84).\nWhy is it taking so long to confirm this?\nThe Red Cross says that the storm destroyed 90% of a major port city in Mozambique called Beira. It cut off roads to the half-million people there, making it difficult for rescue workers to help and assess the damage on the ground. The cyclone knocked out power in the area, caused a dam to burst, and destroyed bridges and homes. It also could lead to food shortages in the region \u2013 since the cyclone apparently ruined the area's farms. It doesn't help that Mozambique is a poor country with a reportedly bad communication and transportation network.\nYikes.\nYup, and since the city is in such bad shape, we may not find out the final number or the true scale of the damage for a while. Emergency officials say that they think the death toll will drastically go up, but there's no way to know for now if it'll hit the president's estimate.\nI have to ask...is this related to climate change?\nUnclear. Cyclones are normal this time of year in the area. But they're becoming more frequent. Cyclones need warm air to form \u2013 and if global temperatures continue to increase, the number of cyclones may too.\nThe president reportedly says the country is facing a \"humanitarian disaster of large proportions.\" If the death toll winds up reaching 1,000 or higher in Mozambique, it could be the deadliest storm in the country's history.\nREPEAT AFTER ME...\nWhat people are thinking about\u2026\nThe Netherlands. Yesterday, a gunman killed three people and wounded five more on a tram in the city of Utrecht (about 25 miles from Amsterdam). Hours after the attack, police arrested a suspect \u2013 a 37-year-old Turkish man with a criminal record. Authorities were treating it as a possible act of terrorism, though it's still unclear what the motive was. A Turkish news agency reported it was part of a family dispute. The attack had people around the world on edge, fearing a possible terrorist attack so soon after the Christchurch shooting in New Zealand.\nI'm listening. The Supreme Court isn't. Yesterday, it said it won't hear the case of a Hawaiian B&B owner who refused to rent a room to a lesbian couple. In 2007, the owner refused to let the couple stay there because she said it violated her religious beliefs. The couple took the issue to court \u2013 which found that the owner discriminated against them based on their sexual orientation. The owner appealed, and the case made its way up to the Supreme Court. Eyes were on how the court would handle this case, since it sided last year with a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a gay wedding because of his faith. But the Supremes decided to pass on the Hawaiian B&B case \u2013 meaning that the lower court ruling stands. What the Supremes will take up: a case challenging a life-without-parole sentence for one of the convicted Beltway snipers who was underage at the time of his crimes.\nSkimm More: Yesterday, SCOTUS decided what it is and isn't listening to next term. Our podcast goes into the gerrymandering case currently on its docket.\nWhat to say when you hear Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wants to get rid of the electoral college...\nPutting her foot down. Just like France's prime minister. He announced a ban on yellow vest protests in areas like the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris following violent riots. The movement started in November over a proposed fuel tax hike, but turned into general protests against the government. And have been going on for 18 weekends in a row. This past weekend, things turned violent and some well-known businesses were damaged or destroyed. Now, the PM is saying 'enough is enough.' And putting a ban on protests in the worst hit neighborhoods. Peaceful and authorized protests are reportedly allowed to continue. Meanwhile, the US and Russia are trying to do some damage control too. They're meeting in Italy this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela. The South American country is in the middle of political turmoil with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (backed by Russia) and Juan Guaid\u00f3 (backed by the US) both claiming the presidency. The US and Russia are trying to play mediators and are reportedly talking about how to encourage negotiations between the two sides.\nWhat to say when you're tired of hearing about men misbehaving\u2026\nDon't let the door hit you on the way out. Yesterday, WarnerMedia said Warner Bros CEO and chairman Kevin Tsujihara is stepping down following sexual misconduct allegations. Earlier this month, a report came out that included allegations that he helped a woman he was having sex with get acting roles.

Researchers think humans might be able to sense Earth's magnetic field. So, next time you're lost and your phone is dead, trust your inner GPS.\nWhat to say after you join your office sports league\u2026\nDon't drop the ball. Yesterday, ESPN accidentally leaked the women's NCAA basketball tournament bracket hours before it was set to be revealed. It wouldn't be March without a little bit of madness.\nSkimm More: We have everything you need to know about the 2019 college basketball tournament, including the teams and players to watch.\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

The federal government said it could happen anytime &ndash; even months or years after. A lower court ruled that immigrants could <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Fo6LYk\">only be detained</a> without a bond hearing if they were detained right after release.</p>\n<h3>What are the Supremes saying?</h3>\n<p>Yesterday, they ruled 5-4 that the gov can detain immigrants guilty of a deportable offense after they have completed prison terms &ndash; no matter how long ago they were released. And can be held indefinitely without a bond hearing. But the Supremes said individual immigrants could challenge the law. And they may argue that this violates their due process rights under the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In other immigration news, the Trump admin is <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2HuUqUH\">releasing hundreds of families</a> caught crossing the US-Mexico border in Texas. The reason: overcrowding and safety concerns. Some families will be processed and released, and will apparently have to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TYN9Cj\">report back</a> later to start their deportation or asylum cases.</p>\n<p>The Obama admin shared the same position as the Trump admin on the SCOTUS case. But the ruling gives President Trump more authority as he moves towards hardline immigration policies. And means that hundreds or perhaps thousands of immigrants may face arrest soon.</p>\n<h2>West Virginia</h2>\n<h3>What's this about?</h3>\n<p>For years, the Catholic Church has been <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Fo0fRv\">dealing</a> with sex abuse scandal after sex abuse scandal. Now, West Virginia's AG filed a lawsuit against the Catholic diocese and a former bishop there. He's alleging that they knowingly hired predators, failed to conduct proper background checks, and chose to cover up criminal behavior. The case is being brought under the state's Consumer Credit and Protection Act alleging that the diocese advertised safe environments for children while at the same time&hellip;doing the opposite.</p>\n<p>Consumer law seems random, we know. But it's a calculated legal move that could apparently get access to the church's files. And might set a precedent for how legal proceedings against the Catholic Church could go down in the future.</p>\n<h2>REPEAT AFTER ME...</h2>\n<h3>What the new parents in your office are talking about&hellip;</h3>\n<p>The FDA. It just approved the first drug to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2U4Ez5b\">treat postpartum depression</a> The disorder affects about 400,000 women in the US every year &ndash; and without any treatment, it could last for months or years. That could change with this new approved drug. How it works: it's administered as one 60-hour IV infusion. And symptoms could apparently improve within one day. The drug is expected to be available in June.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you get stuck in the middle of a fight&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Let's settle this. Facebook is again and again doing the same. Groups like the ACLU have sued the company for giving advertisers the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2WdsPL4\">ability to block ads</a> for some people based on things like their race, gender, and disability status. Specifically for housing, credit, and job ads. Enter: discrimination lawsuits. Now, Facebook is trying to patch things up by no longer giving out some personal info and limiting what advertisers can use to target users. It also plans to create a tool that'll show every housing ad in the US, even if you aren't targeted for the ad. Oh, and it'll also cough up $5 million as part of the settlement. But it's not in the clear yet, since the company is still facing a separate complaint from the Dept of Housing and Urban Development over the housing ads issue. Even though Facebook's revenue isn't expected to take a big hit, it's still a big overhaul for a company that's created a major advertising platform. The company says the changes should be done by the end of the year. While you're waiting for that to happen, feel free to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ThtFEz\">shop on Insta</a>.</p>\n<h3>What people are thinking about&hellip;</h3>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TLba0v%20\">The Midwest</a>. Yesterday, VP Mike Pence visited the region, which is experiencing historic flooding &ndash; and prepping for more as rivers continue to rise and snow melts. At least three people have died and hundreds have been displaced. Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have all declared states of emergency. Many fields are ruined and livestock have died in these big <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ULLNI6\">farming states</a> &ndash; which could have a major impact on the industry.</p>\n<h3>Who's packing up their desk&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Kazakhstan's President <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2TMk0L7\">Nursultan Nazarbayev</a>. Yesterday, he announced his resignation after nearly 30 years in power. He's been credited for maintaining stability and peace there, but has been criticized for sidelining the opposition. Although he's staying on as the head of the ruling party, the speaker of the upper house of parliament is taking over as interim president until next year's elections. Who also resigned yesterday: <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Teho3L\">Tsunekazu Takeda</a>&ndash; the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee. He's under investigation for allegedly paying bribes to get the votes for Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympics. He denies the allegations, and will step down in June. Here's another name in the headlines: <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2WdFygF\">Stephen Dickson</a>. President Trump says he'll tap the former Delta pilot and exec as the new FAA Administrator. The agency's been without a permanent head for more than a year &ndash; and this comes as it is dealing with the aftermath of a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Yb0nLh\">second deadly</a></p>\n<h3>What to say when you hear about Mike Trout's historic deal&hellip;</h3>\n<p>He's not the only one breaking records. <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2FnBqFi\">Karen Uhlenbeck</a> became the first woman to ever win the Abel Prize &ndash; aka one of the most prestigious math awards.

                "text": "THINGS GETTING LEGAL\nSCOTUS\nYesterday, the Supreme Court handed the Trump administration an immigration win.\nWhat's this about?\nA 1996 law says that the federal gov can detain any immigrant convicted of certain crimes \"when the alien is released.\" The word that caused debate was \"when.\" Immigrants' rights advocates interpreted that as immediately after being released from criminal custody. The federal government said it could happen anytime \u2013 even months or years after. A lower court ruled that immigrants could only be detained without a bond hearing if they were detained right after release.\nWhat are the Supremes saying?\nYesterday, they ruled 5-4 that the gov can detain immigrants guilty of a deportable offense after they have completed prison terms \u2013 no matter how long ago they were released. And can be held indefinitely without a bond hearing. But the Supremes said individual immigrants could challenge the law. And they may argue that this violates their due process rights under the Constitution.\nIn other immigration news, the Trump admin is releasing hundreds of families caught crossing the US-Mexico border in Texas. The reason: overcrowding and safety concerns. Some families will be processed and released, and will apparently have to report back later to start their deportation or asylum cases.\nThe Obama admin shared the same position as the Trump admin on the SCOTUS case. But the ruling gives President Trump more authority as he moves towards hardline immigration policies. And means that hundreds or perhaps thousands of immigrants may face arrest soon.\nWest Virginia\nWhat's this about?\nFor years, the Catholic Church has been dealing with sex abuse scandal after sex abuse scandal. Now, West Virginia's AG filed a lawsuit against the Catholic diocese and a former bishop there. He's alleging that they knowingly hired predators, failed to conduct proper background checks, and chose to cover up criminal behavior. The case is being brought under the state's Consumer Credit and Protection Act alleging that the diocese advertised safe environments for children while at the same time\u2026doing the opposite.\nConsumer law seems random, we know. But it's a calculated legal move that could apparently get access to the church's files. And might set a precedent for how legal proceedings against the Catholic Church could go down in the future.\nREPEAT AFTER ME...\nWhat the new parents in your office are talking about\u2026\nThe FDA. It just approved the first drug to treat postpartum depression The disorder affects about 400,000 women in the US every year \u2013 and without any treatment, it could last for months or years. That could change with this new approved drug. How it works: it's administered as one 60-hour IV infusion. And symptoms could apparently improve within one day. The drug is expected to be available in June.\nWhat to say when you get stuck in the middle of a fight\u2026\nLet's settle this. Facebook is again and again doing the same. Groups like the ACLU have sued the company for giving advertisers the ability to block ads for some people based on things like their race, gender, and disability status. Specifically for housing, credit, and job ads. Enter: discrimination lawsuits. Now, Facebook is trying to patch things up by no longer giving out some personal info and limiting what advertisers can use to target users. It also plans to create a tool that'll show every housing ad in the US, even if you aren't targeted for the ad. Oh, and it'll also cough up $5 million as part of the settlement. But it's not in the clear yet, since the company is still facing a separate complaint from the Dept of Housing and Urban Development over the housing ads issue. Even though Facebook's revenue isn't expected to take a big hit, it's still a big overhaul for a company that's created a major advertising platform. The company says the changes should be done by the end of the year. While you're waiting for that to happen, feel free to shop on Insta.\nWhat people are thinking about\u2026\nThe Midwest. Yesterday, VP Mike Pence visited the region, which is experiencing historic flooding \u2013 and prepping for more as rivers continue to rise and snow melts. At least three people have died and hundreds have been displaced. Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin have all declared states of emergency. Many fields are ruined and livestock have died in these big farming states \u2013 which could have a major impact on the industry.\nWho's packing up their desk\u2026\nKazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Yesterday, he announced his resignation after nearly 30 years in power. He's been credited for maintaining stability and peace there, but has been criticized for sidelining the opposition. Although he's staying on as the head of the ruling party, the speaker of the upper house of parliament is taking over as interim president until next year's elections. Who also resigned yesterday: Tsunekazu Takeda\u2013 the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee. He's under investigation for allegedly paying bribes to get the votes for Tokyo to host the 2020 Olympics. He denies the allegations, and will step down in June. Here's another name in the headlines: Stephen Dickson. President Trump says he'll tap the former Delta pilot and exec as the new FAA Administrator. The agency's been without a permanent head for more than a year \u2013 and this comes as it is dealing with the aftermath of a second deadly\nWhat to say when you hear about Mike Trout's historic deal\u2026\nHe's not the only one breaking records. Karen Uhlenbeck became the first woman to ever win the Abel Prize \u2013 aka one of the most prestigious math awards. The limit for how awesome she is does not exist.\nSkimm More: For Women's History Month, we're highlighting 19 women and movements who've paved the way in their industries.\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

                "html": "<h3>FINDING SANCTUARY (CITIES)</h3>\n<p>President Trump is taking a long, hard look at <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2v4cOeD\">sanctuary cities</a>.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Before we get into this, can you remind me about them?</h4>\n<p>They're places that have rules limiting local officials' cooperation with ICE to help arrest and detain undocumented immigrants. They're mostly left-leaning cities like San Francisco, NYC, LA, Chicago, and Boston.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Thanks. So what exactly is the Trump admin doing?</h4>\n<p>Over the weekend, he said he was considering moving migrants caught crossing into the US illegally to these cities. And defied his admin's claims that it had dropped the idea. The admin says it's not ideal, but it's an option if Congress doesn't overhaul immigration law.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What's the point of that?</h4>\n<p>To help fix some problems at the border. There's a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2XaaNtt\">record number</a> of migrants trying to get into the US, straining resources. It's also led to a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2UiCJJE\">backlog</a> of hundreds of thousands of immigration cases. The admin thinks that moving migrants to other cities could help ease the pressure at border towns. But some think it's just political retaliation.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">More on that, please.</h4>\n<p>Trump says that the &quot;radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy&quot; and that they should be happy about this new potential policy. Some Democratic reps and mayors have already said they'd <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Kz9NgT\">welcome</a> the migrants. And there's the potential that this move <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2DflF1x\">could help migrants</a> get approval to stay in the US. At the same time, many have criticized the policy as a cynical way to treat people seeking political asylum.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">So can Trump actually do this?</h4>\n<p>It's not clear he has the money for it. This could cost DHS a lot, and leave the department &ndash; which is already dealing with a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2IkiRUW\">staffing shake-up</a> &ndash; liable for problems that may happen during transfers (like injuries). Also, it's not entirely clear that the move is <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Xhz6pz\">legal</a>.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">theSkimm</h4>\n<p>Immigration has been a top priority for President Trump, and his admin has struggled to deal with the influx of migrants. Now, he's hoping to use sanctuary cities as a way to call Democrats' bluff and get them to the negotiating table to talk border security.</p>\n<h3>REPEAT AFTER ME...</h3>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What to say when your boss assigns you work over the weekend&hellip;</h4>\n<p>New management, please. Last week, <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2GchpRa\">Sudan</a>'s military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir, after months of protests and a days-long sit-in. It marked the end of the leader's brutal 30-year rule. But protesters have refused to stop until there's a civilian government. Now, amid pressure, the military reportedly says it'll name a civilian prime minister and cabinet &ndash; but will hold off on tapping a new civilian president. It's not expected to be enough to satisfy protesters. Meanwhile, down in <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2VFRvvE\">Madagascar</a>, a measles crisis is apparently getting worse. More than 1,200 people have reportedly been killed and more than 115,000 are infected. You need a high immunization rate to help prevent a measles outbreak (think: about 90-95% of people in an area). But in Madagascar, less than 60% of people are vaccinated. Now public health officials are apparently struggling to expand access to vaccinations quickly enough to contain what could be the country's largest outbreak, ever.</p>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2HXyl0W\"><em>Skimm More</em></a><em>: Here's where things stand with measles in the US.</em></p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">Who people are talking about...</h4>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Pa3XBu\">Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN).</a> While talking about Islamophobia at an event last month, Omar &ndash; one of the first Muslim congresswomen &ndash; said that the Council on American-Islamic Relations &quot;was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.&quot; (Note: CAIR was founded in 1994.) Some were concerned that Omar's &quot;some people did something&quot; language underplayed the severity of the attacks...including President Trump. Over the weekend, he tweeted a video criticizing Omar that included images of the attacks and the words &quot;we remember.&quot; Democrats &ndash; including a number of 2020 candidates &ndash; have accused Trump of <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2KDF8zn\">inciting violence against</a> Omar, who has faced death threats since taking office earlier this year. And have called on him to take the video down. Speaking of 2020, <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2DbVA3C\">Pete Buttigieg</a> is officially <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Ttobvu\">joining the field</a>.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\"><br data-fn=\"rn\">What to say when the paper reaches the bin...</h4>\n<p>Ah, how it must feel to be <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2IjTmU0\">Tiger Woods</a>. Yesterday, Woods made one of the biggest comebacks in sports history with his fifth snazzy green Masters jacket and his 15th major title. It was also his first win in more than a decade after struggling with injuries, a DUI, and a sex scandal. That means he's one step closer to Jack Nicklaus' career record of 18 major titles. Don't you fore-get about me.</p>\n<p>Hollywood writers are waving goodbye <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2IxxS5g\">to their agents</a>. Since the '70s, the two have coexisted in a pretty simple relationship: writers bring the talent and agents get them jobs...in exchange for a cut of the money. But over the weekend, talks between the two broke down. That's because the writers' union &ndash; the Writers Guild of America &ndash; was frustrated over how agents were starting to work more closely with studios without passing on the extra money. Now, the writers' union is telling 13,000 Hollywood writers to fire their agents until they can work something out. But heads up, if this continues for a while longer (think: June), it could be harder for new shows and movies to hire talent.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What's updating its policies...</h4>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2KDkRKd\">Morehouse College</a>. Over the weekend, the all-male historically black school in Atlanta said it would start accepting transgender men in 2020. The move follows <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2V4Vxkp%20\">a similar transgender policy</a> adopted by Spelman College, an all-female historically black school, in 2017.</p>\n<h4><br data-fn=\"rn\">What to say when you feel like someone's watching you...</h4>\n<h2>Sign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.</h2>",

                "text": "FINDING SANCTUARY (CITIES)\nPresident Trump is taking a long, hard look at sanctuary cities.\nBefore we get into this, can you remind me about them?\nThey're places that have rules limiting local officials' cooperation with ICE to help arrest and detain undocumented immigrants. They're mostly left-leaning cities like San Francisco, NYC, LA, Chicago, and Boston.\nThanks. So what exactly is the Trump admin doing?\nOver the weekend, he said he was considering moving migrants caught crossing into the US illegally to these cities. And defied his admin's claims that it had dropped the idea. The admin says it's not ideal, but it's an option if Congress doesn't overhaul immigration law.\nWhat's the point of that?\nTo help fix some problems at the border. There's a record number of migrants trying to get into the US, straining resources. It's also led to a backlog of hundreds of thousands of immigration cases. The admin thinks that moving migrants to other cities could help ease the pressure at border towns. But some think it's just political retaliation.\nMore on that, please.\nTrump says that the \"radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy\" and that they should be happy about this new potential policy. Some Democratic reps and mayors have already said they'd welcome the migrants. And there's the potential that this move could help migrants get approval to stay in the US. At the same time, many have criticized the policy as a cynical way to treat people seeking political asylum.\nSo can Trump actually do this?\nIt's not clear he has the money for it. This could cost DHS a lot, and leave the department \u2013 which is already dealing with a staffing shake-up \u2013 liable for problems that may happen during transfers (like injuries). Also, it's not entirely clear that the move is legal.\ntheSkimm\nImmigration has been a top priority for President Trump, and his admin has struggled to deal with the influx of migrants. Now, he's hoping to use sanctuary cities as a way to call Democrats' bluff and get them to the negotiating table to talk border security.\nREPEAT AFTER ME...\nWhat to say when your boss assigns you work over the weekend\u2026\nNew management, please. Last week, Sudan's military overthrew President Omar al-Bashir, after months of protests and a days-long sit-in. It marked the end of the leader's brutal 30-year rule. But protesters have refused to stop until there's a civilian government. Now, amid pressure, the military reportedly says it'll name a civilian prime minister and cabinet \u2013 but will hold off on tapping a new civilian president. It's not expected to be enough to satisfy protesters. Meanwhile, down in Madagascar, a measles crisis is apparently getting worse. More than 1,200 people have reportedly been killed and more than 115,000 are infected. You need a high immunization rate to help prevent a measles outbreak (think: about 90-95% of people in an area). But in Madagascar, less than 60% of people are vaccinated. Now public health officials are apparently struggling to expand access to vaccinations quickly enough to contain what could be the country's largest outbreak, ever.\nSkimm More: Here's where things stand with measles in the US.\nWho people are talking about...\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN). While talking about Islamophobia at an event last month, Omar \u2013 one of the first Muslim congresswomen \u2013 said that the Council on American-Islamic Relations \"was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\" (Note: CAIR was founded in 1994.) Some were concerned that Omar's \"some people did something\" language underplayed the severity of the attacks...including President Trump. Over the weekend, he tweeted a video criticizing Omar that included images of the attacks and the words \"we remember.\" Democrats \u2013 including a number of 2020 candidates \u2013 have accused Trump of inciting violence against Omar, who has faced death threats since taking office earlier this year. And have called on him to take the video down. Speaking of 2020, Pete Buttigieg is officially joining the field.\nWhat to say when the paper reaches the bin...\nAh, how it must feel to be Tiger Woods. Yesterday, Woods made one of the biggest comebacks in sports history with his fifth snazzy green Masters jacket and his 15th major title. It was also his first win in more than a decade after struggling with injuries, a DUI, and a sex scandal. That means he's one step closer to Jack Nicklaus' career record of 18 major titles. Don't you fore-get about me.\nHollywood writers are waving goodbye to their agents. Since the '70s, the two have coexisted in a pretty simple relationship: writers bring the talent and agents get them jobs...in exchange for a cut of the money. But over the weekend, talks between the two broke down. That's because the writers' union \u2013 the Writers Guild of America \u2013 was frustrated over how agents were starting to work more closely with studios without passing on the extra money. Now, the writers' union is telling 13,000 Hollywood writers to fire their agents until they can work something out. But heads up, if this continues for a while longer (think: June), it could be harder for new shows and movies to hire talent.\nWhat's updating its policies...\nMorehouse College. Over the weekend, the all-male historically black school in Atlanta said it would start accepting transgender men in 2020. The move follows a similar transgender policy adopted by Spelman College, an all-female historically black school, in 2017.\nWhat to say when you feel like someone's watching you...\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

                "html": "<h2>NOTRE DAME</h2>\n<h3>What happened?</h3>\n<h3>All that history...</h3>\n<p>Exactly. It's a landmark piece of architecture that was built starting in the 12th century at the proposal of the city's bishop. It took about 200 years to finish and is one of the most famous medieval Gothic cathedrals in the world. That's in large part because of its <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2UYJ3up\">architecture</a>.</p>\n<h3>Can the cathedral be repaired?</h3>\n<p>French officials are hoping so, since it looks like the main structure was saved. Two <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2DgFcip\">prominent French families</a> pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to help rebuild the cathedral. Notre Dame was damaged in the 16th century and again during the French Revolution in the 18th century. Thanks to renewed attention after Victor Hugo's 1831 novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame,&quot; it was ultimately restored. Firefighters have <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2GqYbsA\">rescued</a> some of the art and relics, like the crown of thorns we mentioned above.</p>\n<h3>Now I just want to keep everything safe forever.</h3>\n<p>You and us both. This isn't the first time a UNESCO world heritage site &ndash; with significance to many &ndash; has been damaged or destroyed. Many also mourned as religious monuments were destroyed in <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Zf90oX\">Syria</a> and <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2KI5kbS\">Iraq</a> in recent years. And dozens of other sites remain <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Z5QsHs\">in danger</a> due to things like flooding and erosion from rising sea levels.</p>\n<p>An estimated 13 million people visit Notre Dame each year &ndash; making it one of the most visited landmarks in the world. And a national symbol of France abroad. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral because it's &quot;what the French expect&quot; and &quot;what our history deserves.&quot;</p>\n<h2>REPEAT AFTER ME...</h2>\n<h3>What people are watching&hellip;</h3>\n<p><a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2DfN0R8\">Libya</a>. The UN says that at least 146 people were killed there this month. The country is split between rival governments: the UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in the western capital of Tripoli and military leader Khalifa Hifter in the east. Hifter is backed by the UAE, France, and Egypt, who see him as a strongman who could confront terrorism and bring stability to the country. Earlier this month, he launched an offensive to seize control of the capital. The death toll is mounting, and there are concerns that this could lead to the worst violence since the start of the 2011 civil war. Meanwhile, the US and Taliban are reportedly set to have <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2UDM8R7\">women join their peace talks</a> in Qatar this month. The Taliban &ndash; which ran most of Afghanistan in the '90s &ndash; has long been known for its strict implementation of Islamic law, and its brutal repression of women. Now, the group reportedly says it's open to inclusion &ndash; a potential positive step as the US and Taliban try to end the 17-year-war in Afghanistan.</p>\n<h3>What still has people on edge&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Measles &ndash; aka the highly contagious and potentially deadly virus that can be prevented with a vaccine. The World Health Organization says that the number of reported cases went up about <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2V5CohU\">300%</a> in the first three months of 2019, compared to the same period last year. The US is one of the many countries reeling from the crisis &ndash; and is on pace for its <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2Ik1tzT\">worst measles outbreak</a> in 25 years.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you hear Tiger Woods is getting a medal&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Everyone else gets the Mueller report. The Justice Department says it'll <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2X85ESC\">release the report</a> to lawmakers and the public on Thursday. But don't place your bets on what's in the report just yet &ndash; a lot of it could be redacted. Because, you know, legal reasons and classified info and stuff like that. In other news hitting DC, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2GeCaf4\">officially running</a> against President Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination.</p>\n<h3>What to say after finishing everything on your to-do list before noon&hellip;</h3>\n<p>Well this is a good feeling. Yesterday, people more fit than you ran the <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2ZccOae\">Boston Marathon</a>. For the men, Kenya's Lawrence Cherono came in first by two seconds. For the ladies, Ethiopia's Worknesh Degefa placed first. She apparently ran the last 20 miles alone, probably while listening to Celine Dion's &quot;All By Myself.&quot; Speaking of people winning at life, this year's <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"https://skimmth.is/2GqMAtv\">Pulitzer Prize</a> winners were announced yesterday. The Wall Street Journal won for its investigation into hush payments to women claiming to have an affair with President Trump. The South Florida Sun Sentinel won for its reporting of the Parkland shooting, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for its coverage of last year's synagogue shooting. Reuters photographers got a prize for their pictures of migrants traveling from Central America to the US. And next up on your reading list: &quot;Amity and Prosperity&quot; by Eliza Griswold and &quot;The Overstory&quot; by Richard Powers.</p>\n<h3>What to say when you can't wrap your head around the latest fashion trends&hellip;</h3>\n<h2>Sign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.</h2>",

                "text": "NOTRE DAME\nWhat happened?\nAll that history...\nExactly. It's a landmark piece of architecture that was built starting in the 12th century at the proposal of the city's bishop. It took about 200 years to finish and is one of the most famous medieval Gothic cathedrals in the world. That's in large part because of its architecture.\nCan the cathedral be repaired?\nFrench officials are hoping so, since it looks like the main structure was saved. Two prominent French families pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to help rebuild the cathedral. Notre Dame was damaged in the 16th century and again during the French Revolution in the 18th century. Thanks to renewed attention after Victor Hugo's 1831 novel \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" it was ultimately restored. Firefighters have rescued some of the art and relics, like the crown of thorns we mentioned above.\nNow I just want to keep everything safe forever.\nYou and us both. This isn't the first time a UNESCO world heritage site \u2013 with significance to many \u2013 has been damaged or destroyed. Many also mourned as religious monuments were destroyed in Syria and Iraq in recent years. And dozens of other sites remain in danger due to things like flooding and erosion from rising sea levels.\nAn estimated 13 million people visit Notre Dame each year \u2013 making it one of the most visited landmarks in the world. And a national symbol of France abroad. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the cathedral because it's \"what the French expect\" and \"what our history deserves.\"\nREPEAT AFTER ME...\nWhat people are watching\u2026\nLibya. The UN says that at least 146 people were killed there this month. The country is split between rival governments: the UN-backed Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in the western capital of Tripoli and military leader Khalifa Hifter in the east. Hifter is backed by the UAE, France, and Egypt, who see him as a strongman who could confront terrorism and bring stability to the country. Earlier this month, he launched an offensive to seize control of the capital. The death toll is mounting, and there are concerns that this could lead to the worst violence since the start of the 2011 civil war. Meanwhile, the US and Taliban are reportedly set to have women join their peace talks in Qatar this month. The Taliban \u2013 which ran most of Afghanistan in the '90s \u2013 has long been known for its strict implementation of Islamic law, and its brutal repression of women. Now, the group reportedly says it's open to inclusion \u2013 a potential positive step as the US and Taliban try to end the 17-year-war in Afghanistan.\nWhat still has people on edge\u2026\nMeasles \u2013 aka the highly contagious and potentially deadly virus that can be prevented with a vaccine. The World Health Organization says that the number of reported cases went up about 300% in the first three months of 2019, compared to the same period last year. The US is one of the many countries reeling from the crisis \u2013 and is on pace for its worst measles outbreak in 25 years.\nWhat to say when you hear Tiger Woods is getting a medal\u2026\nEveryone else gets the Mueller report. The Justice Department says it'll release the report to lawmakers and the public on Thursday. But don't place your bets on what's in the report just yet \u2013 a lot of it could be redacted. Because, you know, legal reasons and classified info and stuff like that. In other news hitting DC, former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is officially running against President Trump for the 2020 GOP nomination.\nWhat to say after finishing everything on your to-do list before noon\u2026\nWell this is a good feeling. Yesterday, people more fit than you ran the Boston Marathon. For the men, Kenya's Lawrence Cherono came in first by two seconds. For the ladies, Ethiopia's Worknesh Degefa placed first. She apparently ran the last 20 miles alone, probably while listening to Celine Dion's \"All By Myself.\" Speaking of people winning at life, this year's Pulitzer Prize winners were announced yesterday. The Wall Street Journal won for its investigation into hush payments to women claiming to have an affair with President Trump. The South Florida Sun Sentinel won for its reporting of the Parkland shooting, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette won for its coverage of last year's synagogue shooting. Reuters photographers got a prize for their pictures of migrants traveling from Central America to the US. And next up on your reading list: \"Amity and Prosperity\" by Eliza Griswold and \"The Overstory\" by Richard Powers.\nWhat to say when you can't wrap your head around the latest fashion trends\u2026\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

So far this year, more than 670 people in 22 states have gotten measles. That&rsquo;s a record high since the US completely eliminated the disease in 2000.</p>\n<h3>Pause. What exactly is measles?</h3>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2FPGzop\">extremely contagious</a> virus with potentially serious consequences. Someone with the virus can spread it just by sneezing or coughing. At first it feels like getting a cold &ndash; think: cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever. But can also lead to a rash. It can be especially dangerous for kids and lead to things like deafness, brain damage, pneumonia, and death. Doctors say the primary way to prevent the virus is to get the vaccine.</p>\n<h3>Wow. How did this outbreak start?</h3>\n<p>This latest outbreak started last year and is concentrated in a few states &ndash; New York, New Jersey, Washington, and California. It spread primarily from people who brought the virus back from other countries like Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines that are experiencing large outbreaks. Most people who get measles aren&rsquo;t vaccinated. And there are concerns that lower vaccination rates in the US, as well as misinformation about vaccines are helping the virus spread.</p>\n<h3>Lower vaccination rates...why's that?</h3>\n<p>In recent years, more parents in the US have been saying &lsquo;no thanks&rsquo; to vaccinating their kids. Experts say there may be a few reasons for this. One, lack of insurance or access to health care. Two, a growing number of parents claiming <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2FP5tpA\">exemptions</a>. Even though every state requires kids to be vaccinated to go to public school, some states let parents opt out for pretty much any reason. And this leads to communities with lower vaccination rates and a higher risk of infection.</p>\n<h3>I know this is controversial. Give me the opinions.</h3>\n<p>Some parents are worried about vaccines causing autism. This comes from a study in the &lsquo;90s that was exposed for being based on false data and was later retracted. Multiple studies since have confirmed this isn&rsquo;t true. Others don&rsquo;t think vaccines are necessary, since the diseases they prevent have been out of sight, out of mind for so long now (psst, that&rsquo;s thanks to vaccines). There&rsquo;s a list of other concerns. Vaccine supporters say the shots save lives. Philanthropist Melinda Gates is one of these people. When she recently stopped by Skimm HQ, we asked her to weigh in on the outbreak. This is what she said.</p>\n<figure><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbMTDZNLfHA?rel=0\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><em><strong>PS</strong>: Want to know more about the vaccine debate and what&rsquo;s being done to prevent another measles outbreak?

                "text": "Yes. So far this year, more than 670 people in 22 states have gotten measles. That\u2019s a record high since the US completely eliminated the disease in 2000.\nPause. What exactly is measles?\nAn extremely contagious virus with potentially serious consequences. Someone with the virus can spread it just by sneezing or coughing. At first it feels like getting a cold \u2013 think: cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever. But can also lead to a rash. It can be especially dangerous for kids and lead to things like deafness, brain damage, pneumonia, and death. Doctors say the primary way to prevent the virus is to get the vaccine.\nWow. How did this outbreak start?\nThis latest outbreak started last year and is concentrated in a few states \u2013 New York, New Jersey, Washington, and California. It spread primarily from people who brought the virus back from other countries like Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines that are experiencing large outbreaks. Most people who get measles aren\u2019t vaccinated. And there are concerns that lower vaccination rates in the US, as well as misinformation about vaccines are helping the virus spread.\nLower vaccination rates...why's that?\nIn recent years, more parents in the US have been saying \u2018no thanks\u2019 to vaccinating their kids. Experts say there may be a few reasons for this. One, lack of insurance or access to health care. Two, a growing number of parents claiming exemptions. Even though every state requires kids to be vaccinated to go to public school, some states let parents opt out for pretty much any reason. And this leads to communities with lower vaccination rates and a higher risk of infection.\nI know this is controversial. Give me the opinions.\nSome parents are worried about vaccines causing autism. This comes from a study in the \u201890s that was exposed for being based on false data and was later retracted. Multiple studies since have confirmed this isn\u2019t true. Others don\u2019t think vaccines are necessary, since the diseases they prevent have been out of sight, out of mind for so long now (psst, that\u2019s thanks to vaccines). There\u2019s a list of other concerns. Vaccine supporters say the shots save lives. Philanthropist Melinda Gates is one of these people. When she recently stopped by Skimm HQ, we asked her to weigh in on the outbreak. This is what she said.\nPS: Want to know more about the vaccine debate and what\u2019s being done to prevent another measles outbreak?

                "html": "<p>You've been hearing a lot about oil and gas lately...and about a squad called OPEC.</p>\n<h3>Cough, what's OPEC, cough.</h3>\n<p>Stands for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It&rsquo;s a group of <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1JqTk4V\">14 countries</a> that together produce almost half of the world&rsquo;s crude oil. Think: Mideast countries (like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq), African nations, and some spicy South Americans mixed in (Venezuela, Ecuador).</p>\n<h3>Gimme some background.</h3>\n<p>OPEC&rsquo;s <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1FuGRZ9\">official mission</a> is to keep oil prices stable by coordinating on policies and how much oil they produce at one time. But ever since OPEC formed in the 1960s, it has manipulated production to try to keep its own profits high, and sometimes for <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://bit.ly/1Mm0ZRU\">political reasons</a>. Which has at times caused <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1dMCvWN\">major headaches</a> for the US and friends.</p>\n<h3>Why does this matter to me?</h3>\n<p>You might have noticed <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1Sxa5xX\">gas prices </a>have dropped it like it&rsquo;s hot in recent years. That&rsquo;s because there is much more oil supply these days than demand, thanks in big part to fracking. Hint: the controversial way the US produces oil and gas at home (there&rsquo;s a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1KNbvDX\">guide</a> for that). In 2016, OPEC discussed the problem at its regular team sleepover, and whether or not they should <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1Mm4urC\">cut oil production</a> to push up prices again. They decided &lsquo;nah.&rsquo; But earlier this year, they changed their mind. And prices are inching back up again.</p>\n<h3>Why's that?</h3>\n<p>OPEC is <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1AKKUV1\">not a fan</a> of how much gas the US has been passing. In recent years, A LOT of <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/2cOH7ee\">new energy companies</a> have popped up in the US to take advantage of the fracking boom. OPEC kept prices low in the hopes that those companies would decide the juice isn&rsquo;t worth the squeeze, and <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1FusJ1b\">fold up shop</a>. Several companies didn't make it, but overall North American oil and gas found a way to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/2v0pEtP\">make things work</a>. Either way, the last few years have been a <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1Mm3WSu\">stand off</a> between Old School Oil (OPEC) and the New Kids on the Block (the US).</p>\n<p>Some of the member countries like <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/1H0XdNO\">Venezuela and Algeria</a> were not on board with OPEC's decision to let oil prices stay low for so long. That's because they need higher oil prices to balance their budgets and fund their government programs. Low oil prices are a big part of why Venezuela's <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/2u49EK2\">economy has tanked</a>. Plus the Venezuelan president is capitalizing on the chaos and trying to <a data-testid=\"external-link\" href=\"http://skimmth.is/2u0xCBO\">consolidate power</a>. Which is why you've been hearing a lot about the country's political chaos lately.</p>\n<p>OPEC decides more than how much you pay at the pump. Its decisions affect entire economies and the global oil industry, all of which are watching the group's moves closely.</p>\n<h2>Sign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.</h2>",

                "text": "You've been hearing a lot about oil and gas lately...and about a squad called OPEC.\nCough, what's OPEC, cough.\nStands for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It\u2019s a group of 14 countries that together produce almost half of the world\u2019s crude oil. Think: Mideast countries (like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq), African nations, and some spicy South Americans mixed in (Venezuela, Ecuador).\nGimme some background.\nOPEC\u2019s official mission is to keep oil prices stable by coordinating on policies and how much oil they produce at one time. But ever since OPEC formed in the 1960s, it has manipulated production to try to keep its own profits high, and sometimes for political reasons. Which has at times caused major headaches for the US and friends.\nWhy does this matter to me?\nYou might have noticed gas prices have dropped it like it\u2019s hot in recent years. That\u2019s because there is much more oil supply these days than demand, thanks in big part to fracking. Hint: the controversial way the US produces oil and gas at home (there\u2019s a guide for that). In 2016, OPEC discussed the problem at its regular team sleepover, and whether or not they should cut oil production to push up prices again. They decided \u2018nah.\u2019 But earlier this year, they changed their mind. And prices are inching back up again.\nWhy's that?\nOPEC is not a fan of how much gas the US has been passing. In recent years, A LOT of new energy companies have popped up in the US to take advantage of the fracking boom. OPEC kept prices low in the hopes that those companies would decide the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze, and fold up shop. Several companies didn't make it, but overall North American oil and gas found a way to make things work. Either way, the last few years have been a stand off between Old School Oil (OPEC) and the New Kids on the Block (the US).\nSome of the member countries like Venezuela and Algeria were not on board with OPEC's decision to let oil prices stay low for so long. That's because they need higher oil prices to balance their budgets and fund their government programs. Low oil prices are a big part of why Venezuela's economy has tanked. Plus the Venezuelan president is capitalizing on the chaos and trying to consolidate power. Which is why you've been hearing a lot about the country's political chaos lately.\nOPEC decides more than how much you pay at the pump. Its decisions affect entire economies and the global oil industry, all of which are watching the group's moves closely.\nSign up for the Daily Skimm and join the millions who already wake up with us.",

Yesterday, it wrapped up the third impeachment trial in US history when it voted &ndash; almost entirely along party lines &ndash; to acquit the president of...</p> <p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2S526kL\"><b>Abuse of power</b><strong>&hellip;</strong></a>52 senators said 'not guilty,' versus the 48 who disagreed. Reminder: Dems argued that Trump abused his power as president by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival &ndash; former VP Joe Biden (and his son, Hunter). And that the president did this while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Republicans dismissed the case as a partisan ploy by Dems. And <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/383HgYi\">didn't seem to think</a> they succeeded in proving the president's motives here.</p> <p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://skimmth.is/2RkS2Ct\"><b>Obstruction of Congress</b><strong>...</strong></a>53 senators said 'not guilty,' versus the 47 who disagreed. Dems had argued that Trump obstructed Congress by blocking documents and witnesses during the House's investigation. Republicans, though, had said the House should have gotten what it needed before handing off the impeachment case to the Senate.</p> <h3><b>Can you explain the difference in numbers?</b></h3> <p>We sure can. It all came down to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who became the <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/3bfBXqD\">first senator</a> to vote to remove a president of his own party from office. On abuse of power, he sided with the Dems and said the president was &quot;guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.&quot;</p> <h3><b>How did everyone react?</b></h3> <p>The White House said the trial ended in the president's &quot;full vindication and exoneration.&quot; But yesterday, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said the House <a href=\"https://skimmth.is/370z6i5\">may continue</a> its investigation into Trump. And that it will likely subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton. As for the president, he plans to comment on his acquittal later today. And gets to carry on with the rest of his term and focus on his reelection campaign.</p> <h3><b>theSkimm</b></h3> <p>President Trump now joins two former presidents who've been impeached but not removed from office &ndash; and is now the first to run for reelection afterward. While yesterday's acquittal came as no surprise, the impeachment case could have repercussions for years to come.</p> </td> </tr>    </tbody></table> </td> </tr>",

Nearly two months after the Democratic-majority House voted to impeach Trump, the Republican-majority Senate got its say. Yesterday, it wrapped up the third impeachment trial in US history when it voted \u2013 almost entirely along party lines \u2013 to acquit the president of...\nAbuse of power\u202652 senators said 'not guilty,' versus the 48 who disagreed. Reminder: Dems argued that Trump abused his power as president by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rival \u2013 former VP Joe Biden (and his son, Hunter). And that the president did this while withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. Republicans dismissed the case as a partisan ploy by Dems. And didn't seem to think they succeeded in proving the president's motives here.\nObstruction of Congress...53 senators said 'not guilty,' versus the 47 who disagreed. Dems had argued that Trump obstructed Congress by blocking documents and witnesses during the House's investigation. Republicans, though, had said the House should have gotten what it needed before handing off the impeachment case to the Senate.\nCan you explain the difference in numbers?\nWe sure can. It all came down to Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who became the first senator to vote to remove a president of his own party from office. On abuse of power, he sided with the Dems and said the president was \"guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\"\nHow did everyone react?\nThe White House said the trial ended in the president's \"full vindication and exoneration.\" But yesterday, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said the House may continue its investigation into Trump. And that it will likely subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton. As for the president, he plans to comment on his acquittal later today. And gets to carry on with the rest of his term and focus on his reelection campaign.\ntheSkimm\nPresident Trump now joins two former presidents who've been impeached but not removed from office \u2013 and is now the first to run for reelection afterward. While yesterday's acquittal came as no surprise, the impeachment case could have repercussions for years to come.",

In his veto message, Trump wrote that the measure is an \"unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\" The coalition is fighting Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who want to take control of the Yemeni government. The Trump administration has said it must support Saudi Arabia in order to keep Iranian influence from spreading. The war has caused a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians dying from illness and starvation. This is the second veto of Trump's presidency.",

It's very likely Cain's nomination will be unsuccessful, thanks in part to resounding rejections from a handful of key Republicans.</p>\n<p>Still, it's worth noting that not all arguments against these nominees stand up to scrutiny. The loudest objection suggests that putting Moore and Cain on the Fed would jeopardize the central bank's independence, undermine the Fed's ability to properly stabilize the economy, and threaten to deliver us into a Venezuela-style inflation crisis. This line of thinking assumes that the Fed is one of our last remaining credible, functioning, and non-political institutions. But that's simply not true. Moore and Cain can't ruin the Fed, because the Fed has been a failure for years.</p>\n<p>By any reasonable standard, the Fed's &quot;credibility&quot; is a modern day myth. The central bank's ability to set interest rates gives it immense power over Americans' economic fortunes: When the Fed raises interest rates, it holds down inflation, but at the cost of higher unemployment and slower wage growth for workers. (Lowering interest rates potentially allows more inflation, but also allows more economic growth.) Thus the Fed's dual mandate from Congress: to keep inflation low and stable, but also to maximize employment. As the central bank's many defenders point out, it absolutely nailed low and stable inflation over the last few decades. <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/797358/fed-needs-better-rules-democratic-bill-start\">But it's completely failed</a> on the &quot;maximizing employment&quot; front. That failure <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/618964/forgotten-recession-that-irrevocably-damaged-american-economy\">laid much of the foundation</a> for modern wage stagnation, inequality, the death of unions, rampant household insecurity, and a host of other social ills.</p>\n<p>Yet the economists, policymakers, and yes, even journalists, who actually get to judge the Fed's &quot;credibility&quot; all tend to be upper class, which means the narrative that gets passed around about the Fed is overwhelmingly positive. After all, these people rarely suffer when unemployment spikes, even in the depths of a crisis like the Great Recession. Traditional Fed nominees themselves are equally elite. They often hail <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/552449/why-ben-bernankes-new-pimco-gig-troubling\">from a small and rarified socioeconomic slice of the population</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/577789/federal-reserve-been-politicized-thats-good-thing\">the people who <em>do</em> face</a> the regular threat of joblessness and inadequate pay whenever the Fed decides to tamp down prices &mdash; low-income workers and minorities and other vulnerable Americans &mdash; <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/617978/why-federal-reserve-due-radical-reinvention\">remain far removed from the conversations</a> surrounding the Fed.</p>\n<p>Putting Trump's nominees on the Fed Board would not lead the Fed down the path of partisanship &mdash; it is already too far gone. As Neil Irwin perhaps inadvertently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/upshot/fed-moore-cain-risk-partisanship.html\">points out</a> at <em>The New York Times, </em>the Fed's monetary policy decisions inherently &quot;pit the interests of workers against owners of capital, and those of banks against those of consumers.&quot; Those decisions are nothing if not &quot;political.&quot; Fed officials routinely characterize empowered workers and labor movements that can actually force employers to meet their demands as threats to be neutralized. And they routinely set out to squash the share of national income that working Americans can claw away from wealthy shareholders. In fact, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who is widely credited with ending the 1970s inflation crisis and for inaugurating the Fed's modern era of credibility, <a href=\"https://jwmason.org/slackwire/at-jacobin-the-fed-doesnt-work-for-you/\">was pretty explicit</a> about crushing unions and <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/810196/everyone-loves-paul-volcker-everyone-wrong\">pushing down the incomes</a> of working Americans.</p>\n<p>No one ever seems to worry that it's the business leaders, Wall Street, or the capital-owning class &mdash; not politicians themselves &mdash; who might push the Fed into over-prioritizing low inflation, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/580975/know-who-likes-lackluster-economic-growth-rich\">and create a permanent semi-slump</a>. Yet if you look back at the last 30 years, a permanent semi-slump <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/588006/what-sick-economy-actually-normal\">is pretty much what we got</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a more subtle argument to be made against Moore and Cain, which is that, being partisans, they may deliberately use monetary policy to make a recession worse if the other party happens to hold the White House. Fretting over this would make way more sense than the existential fear that they'd some how erode the Fed's already non-existent credibility and independence. Indeed, the narrative in defense of the traditional Fed is almost entirely divorced from the problems the economy actually faces in the modern era.</p>\n<p>The desire to stick with traditional Fed picks would certainly rule out hacks like Moore and Cain. But it would also rule out nominees drawn from civil rights activists, leaders of Black Lives Matter, union representatives, community organizers, or anyone else who might bring a more populist, worker-friendly, or bottom-up perspective to the Fed's priorities and deliberations. That Trump's latest Fed picks would dispense with the norm of &quot;traditional&quot; nominees is probably the one positive thing that can be said for them.</p>",

In fact, former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who is widely credited with ending the 1970s inflation crisis and for inaugurating the Fed's modern era of credibility, was pretty explicit about crushing unions and pushing down the incomes of working Americans.\nNo one ever seems to worry that it's the business leaders, Wall Street, or the capital-owning class \u2014 not politicians themselves \u2014 who might push the Fed into over-prioritizing low inflation, and create a permanent semi-slump. Yet if you look back at the last 30 years, a permanent semi-slump is pretty much what we got.\nThere is a more subtle argument to be made against Moore and Cain, which is that, being partisans, they may deliberately use monetary policy to make a recession worse if the other party happens to hold the White House. Fretting over this would make way more sense than the existential fear that they'd some how erode the Fed's already non-existent credibility and independence. Indeed, the narrative in defense of the traditional Fed is almost entirely divorced from the problems the economy actually faces in the modern era.\nThe desire to stick with traditional Fed picks would certainly rule out hacks like Moore and Cain. But it would also rule out nominees drawn from civil rights activists, leaders of Black Lives Matter, union representatives, community organizers, or anyone else who might bring a more populist, worker-friendly, or bottom-up perspective to the Fed's priorities and deliberations. That Trump's latest Fed picks would dispense with the norm of \"traditional\" nominees is probably the one positive thing that can be said for them.",

That's far behind the frontrunners Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, with 29 and 24 percent respectively. But it beats a series of candidates with much greater name recognition, much longer track records, and much more prominent perches, including no fewer than five senators &mdash; Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand.</p>\n<p>Buttigieg even edges Beto O'Rourke, the former House member from El Paso, Texas, who challenged and narrowly lost a Senate bid to Ted Cruz last November. When O'Rourke announced his own candidacy in mid-March, analysts predicted he might surge to the head of the pack on a wave of mainstream excitement and anticipation. Here, it seemed, was a possible successor to Barack Obama &mdash; a young, charismatic candidate who could catalyze a movement fueled by a feel-good desire for hope and change from the Trump era, just as Obama had done after eight years of George W. Bush. That impression was bolstered by the fact that several prominent members of the old Obama team swooned early on for Beto, making clear that they saw him as someone who could pick up the mantle from the 44th president, building and perhaps expanding on his enduring popularity.</p>\n<p>Yet O'Rourke has hit the ground with a bit of a thud. Yes, he has enthusiasm and energy. But he isn't catching fire, at least not yet &mdash; and at least not in the way that Buttigieg appears to be doing.</p>\n<p>Unlike Beto, no one was clamoring for &quot;Mayor Pete&quot; to jump into the race. He did it all on his own &mdash; creating a considerable splash at a CNN Town Hall in early March and then agreeing to a flood of interviews that kept his face, biography, accomplishments, and distinctive way of talking about politics close to the center of the action for the past month. The result is that he now leads the second tier of candidates &mdash; and could well surpass Beto in the contest to reboot Obamaism.</p>\n<p>Journalists, activists, pundits, intellectuals &mdash; all of them, myself very much included, think that political campaigns should focus on policy. It's what those who care about ideas think is important. It's what establishes a candidate's seriousness, and what reveals his or her agenda &mdash; what the candidate wants to do with political power. That's why so many of us who lean left swoon for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom lead with very specific and ambitious policy proposals.</p>\n<p>But Buttigieg understands what countless polls have verified, which is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and that even those who devote some time to it tend not to focus on policy specifics. Instead, these relatively low-information voters get carried along by a story &mdash; a story of a candidate and the story that candidate tells about America.</p>\n<p>That's where Buttigieg is excelling, just as Obama did before him.</p>\n<p>What kind of stories do rank-and-file Democrats like to hear? Stories with a happy ending. And what's a happier ending than a candidate from a once-persecuted group triumphing over adversity to run for and possibly win the highest office in the land? That was Obama's story, and it's Buttigieg's, too, right down to <a href=\"https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/04/mayor-pete-kissed-husband-announced-campaign-brought-lgbtq-people-tears/\">the kiss</a> he shared with his husband right after announcing his candidacy for the presidency.</p>\n<p>This is the sunny side of the multicultural identity politics that defines the Democratic Party more thoroughly with each electoral cycle. The darker side of the same trend can be seen when each group attempts to elbow past the others, battling over who's the bigger victim of straight, white, male oppression, while failing to offer a compelling and hopeful vision of the country's future. The Obamaian approach has the distinctive political advantage of acknowledging obstacles to equality and justice while also demonstrating that progress continues &mdash; that underneath or alongside the ugliness of the Trump era, there can be hope for better days.</p>\n<p>Paired with that love of overcoming adversity is the thrill of the party's standard-bearer positioning himself as Beyond Politics. Obama was a <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-his-good-intentions-may-destroy-his-presidency-67155\">master of this</a>, even when (especially in his first term) it left him ill-equipped to defend himself and his party against a Republican Party hellbent on absolute opposition. Buttigieg shows <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/19/how-democrats-can-defeat-trump-his-ugly-ideas-according-pete-buttigieg/?utm_term=.087b7f731aae\">signs</a> of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/28/18283925/pete-buttigieg-mayor-pete-interview-capitalism\">mastering</a> it, too, as when he speaks about Trump voters in terms of understanding and sympathy, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/19/how-democrats-can-defeat-trump-his-ugly-ideas-according-pete-buttigieg/?utm_term=.8562f3880381\">suggesting</a> it's &quot;not accidental that some areas that have seen the most disruption in our social and economic life are those that are most likely to produce a lot of domestic extremists.&quot;</p>\n<p>The Democratic love of presidential candidates who position themselves at least partially above the partisan fray is an expression of what the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/08/upshot/democratic-electorate-twitter-real-life.html\">polls tell us</a>. Whereas the Republican Party has a large base of ideological conservatives who consistently work to pull the GOP to the right, the Democratic base includes a great deal more self-described moderates. Those voters might not be centrists in ideological terms. But they long to be more than a faction. They want to speak for the country as a whole, to be unifiers. They resist the base-mobilization strategy that has been working for the Republicans. They don't just want to galvanize grassroots activists and win by manipulating America's counter-majoritarian institutions. The Democrats crave legitimacy. They want to be loved by as many people as possible, and they believe in their hearts that those supporters can and should include all people of good will.</p>\n<p>What this boils down to is a question of style and, even more so, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-2020-writing-message.html?module=inline\">communication</a>. The assumption is that the Democrats have a core set of moral and policy priorities that the party's nominee doesn't have to list and discuss in detail on the stump. Instead, he or she should stand for ideals, values, a vision. The Democratic nominee should be as broadly appealing as possible, an exemplar of the &quot;better angels of our nature&quot; as Americans. Feel good about him or her, and we'll feel good about ourselves &mdash; and vice versa.</p>\n<p>In his recent <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/all-about-pete\">hit job</a> on Buttigieg from the left in <em>Current Affairs</em>, Nathan Robinson laceratingly parodies how this thinking sounds to someone devoted to pushing a more factional and policy-specific candidacy: &quot;He's from the Rust Belt so he's authentic, but he went to Harvard so he's not a rube, but he's from a small city so he's relatable, but he's gay so he's got coastal appeal, but he's a veteran so his sexuality won't alienate rural people.&quot; Put in a less sneering tone, one might say that Buttigieg hopes to be many things to many kinds of people. Just as Obama was a professorial community organizer with a white Christian mother and a black Muslim father who lived abroad as a boy, admired the mainline Protestant Reinhold Niebuhr, and worshipped in a church run by a pastor who preached black liberation theology.</p>\n<p>Like Walt Whitman &mdash; and like America itself &mdash; Obama contained multitudes. And so does the multilingual gay veteran from blue-collar Indiana.</p>",

But he isn't catching fire, at least not yet \u2014 and at least not in the way that Buttigieg appears to be doing.\nUnlike Beto, no one was clamoring for \"Mayor Pete\" to jump into the race. He did it all on his own \u2014 creating a considerable splash at a CNN Town Hall in early March and then agreeing to a flood of interviews that kept his face, biography, accomplishments, and distinctive way of talking about politics close to the center of the action for the past month. The result is that he now leads the second tier of candidates \u2014 and could well surpass Beto in the contest to reboot Obamaism.\nJournalists, activists, pundits, intellectuals \u2014 all of them, myself very much included, think that political campaigns should focus on policy. It's what those who care about ideas think is important. It's what establishes a candidate's seriousness, and what reveals his or her agenda \u2014 what the candidate wants to do with political power. That's why so many of us who lean left swoon for Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom lead with very specific and ambitious policy proposals.\nBut Buttigieg understands what countless polls have verified, which is that most voters pay little attention to politics, and that even those who devote some time to it tend not to focus on policy specifics. Instead, these relatively low-information voters get carried along by a story \u2014 a story of a candidate and the story that candidate tells about America.\nThat's where Buttigieg is excelling, just as Obama did before him.\nWhat kind of stories do rank-and-file Democrats like to hear? Stories with a happy ending. And what's a happier ending than a candidate from a once-persecuted group triumphing over adversity to run for and possibly win the highest office in the land? That was Obama's story, and it's Buttigieg's, too, right down to the kiss he shared with his husband right after announcing his candidacy for the presidency.\nThis is the sunny side of the multicultural identity politics that defines the Democratic Party more thoroughly with each electoral cycle. The darker side of the same trend can be seen when each group attempts to elbow past the others, battling over who's the bigger victim of straight, white, male oppression, while failing to offer a compelling and hopeful vision of the country's future. The Obamaian approach has the distinctive political advantage of acknowledging obstacles to equality and justice while also demonstrating that progress continues \u2014 that underneath or alongside the ugliness of the Trump era, there can be hope for better days.\nPaired with that love of overcoming adversity is the thrill of the party's standard-bearer positioning himself as Beyond Politics. Obama was a master of this, even when (especially in his first term) it left him ill-equipped to defend himself and his party against a Republican Party hellbent on absolute opposition. Buttigieg shows signs of mastering it, too, as when he speaks about Trump voters in terms of understanding and sympathy, suggesting it's \"not accidental that some areas that have seen the most disruption in our social and economic life are those that are most likely to produce a lot of domestic extremists.\"\nThe Democratic love of presidential candidates who position themselves at least partially above the partisan fray is an expression of what the polls tell us. Whereas the Republican Party has a large base of ideological conservatives who consistently work to pull the GOP to the right, the Democratic base includes a great deal more self-described moderates. Those voters might not be centrists in ideological terms. But they long to be more than a faction. They want to speak for the country as a whole, to be unifiers. They resist the base-mobilization strategy that has been working for the Republicans. They don't just want to galvanize grassroots activists and win by manipulating America's counter-majoritarian institutions. The Democrats crave legitimacy. They want to be loved by as many people as possible, and they believe in their hearts that those supporters can and should include all people of good will.\nWhat this boils down to is a question of style and, even more so, communication. The assumption is that the Democrats have a core set of moral and policy priorities that the party's nominee doesn't have to list and discuss in detail on the stump. Instead, he or she should stand for ideals, values, a vision. The Democratic nominee should be as broadly appealing as possible, an exemplar of the \"better angels of our nature\" as Americans. Feel good about him or her, and we'll feel good about ourselves \u2014 and vice versa.\nIn his recent hit job on Buttigieg from the left in Current Affairs, Nathan Robinson laceratingly parodies how this thinking sounds to someone devoted to pushing a more factional and policy-specific candidacy: \"He's from the Rust Belt so he's authentic, but he went to Harvard so he's not a rube, but he's from a small city so he's relatable, but he's gay so he's got coastal appeal, but he's a veteran so his sexuality won't alienate rural people.\" Put in a less sneering tone, one might say that Buttigieg hopes to be many things to many kinds of people. Just as Obama was a professorial community organizer with a white Christian mother and a black Muslim father who lived abroad as a boy, admired the mainline Protestant Reinhold Niebuhr, and worshipped in a church run by a pastor who preached black liberation theology.\nLike Walt Whitman \u2014 and like America itself \u2014 Obama contained multitudes. And so does the multilingual gay veteran from blue-collar Indiana.",

Perhaps most important of all, he insisted that Democrats must do more than simply run against President Trump in 2020. He sounded smart, concise, and polished in a way that he rarely has, and managed to do so despite a hostile and occasionally moronic line of questioning &mdash; e.g., the usual &quot;If you love taxes so much, why don't you marry them?&quot; shtick.</p>\n<p>Sanders's willingness to go into the lions' den shows that he already sees himself not as someone contending for the nomination of his party but rather as a de facto nominee pitching his ideas to the wider American public. This confidence puts him in a rhetorically advantageous position.</p>\n<p>The Democratic National Committee's announcement in March that Fox News would not be allowed to host any debates with its candidates was cowardly. (It also side-stepped the fact that no network's talent tried harder to hold Trump to account during the last cycle of debates than Fox News' Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.) Sanders understands that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by appearing in front of right-leaning audiences. On a channel where the top opinion program is hosted by Tucker Carlson, who has spoken positively about single-payer health care and criticized the financialization of the American economy, why shouldn't Democrats expect to reach people?</p>\n<p>Because only one of them is Bernie. This is the key to his appeal and the path he will try to take toward the nomination in 2020. If 2016 showed us anything it is that in an overly crowded primary field one candidate who is able to distinguish himself clearly and immediately from the competition can win primaries. This will not be because he starts with the support of an overwhelming majority &mdash; much the opposite. But all Sanders needs is what Trump had last time, which is to say, a plurality of 25 or 30 percent. When you add up their 1 or 2 or 5 percent each, the other dozen or so candidates have more voters between them, but it counts for absolutely nothing.</p>\n<p>There is one likely obstacle for Sanders and his outsider-plurality strategy going forward. This is the possibility that Democrats will line up behind a single establishment candidate whose chief virtue for many is that simply that he or she is not Sanders. This is what Republicans failed to do in 2016 when Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich each in turn presented himself as the healthy consensus choice only to find themselves rejected by the party's base.</p>\n<p>The most obvious person to fill this role in 2020 is, of course, Joe Biden, who has not even announced his candidacy yet. His attempt to apologize without apologizing for his handsy antics will please older voters, but it is unlikely to persuade the crucial but poorly understood bloc of younger Democrats who are socially liberal and fiscally moderate without explicitly acknowledging the latter &mdash; what I think of as the <em>Refinery29 </em>vote. Biden may not be an old white man with some icky misogynistic supporters like Sanders, but he still has too much baggage. There will always be as many arguments against him as there are for him, just as there were always enough reasons on hand for GOP primary voters to convince themselves not to get behind Jeb and Little Marco in 2016.</p>\n<p>Sanders's political future is not assured. In addition to defining himself against the competition, he will require a certain amount of luck. The longer his fellow candidates remain in the race, the more successful his strategy is likely to be. The other lesson of the last election is one that he will probably remember &mdash; namely, that a radical outsider stands less of a chance running against one serious establishment candidate. Against the alphabet soup of O'RourkeWarrenButtigiegBookerKlobucharCastroYangGillibrandDelaneyGabbard he is Bernie. Against, say, Kamala Harris with the full backing of the DNC, he is, well, Bernie. That will make all the difference.</p>",

He sounded smart, concise, and polished in a way that he rarely has, and managed to do so despite a hostile and occasionally moronic line of questioning \u2014 e.g., the usual \"If you love taxes so much, why don't you marry them?\" shtick.\nSanders's willingness to go into the lions' den shows that he already sees himself not as someone contending for the nomination of his party but rather as a de facto nominee pitching his ideas to the wider American public. This confidence puts him in a rhetorically advantageous position.\nThe Democratic National Committee's announcement in March that Fox News would not be allowed to host any debates with its candidates was cowardly. (It also side-stepped the fact that no network's talent tried harder to hold Trump to account during the last cycle of debates than Fox News' Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace.) Sanders understands that he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by appearing in front of right-leaning audiences. On a channel where the top opinion program is hosted by Tucker Carlson, who has spoken positively about single-payer health care and criticized the financialization of the American economy, why shouldn't Democrats expect to reach people?\nBecause only one of them is Bernie. This is the key to his appeal and the path he will try to take toward the nomination in 2020. If 2016 showed us anything it is that in an overly crowded primary field one candidate who is able to distinguish himself clearly and immediately from the competition can win primaries. This will not be because he starts with the support of an overwhelming majority \u2014 much the opposite. But all Sanders needs is what Trump had last time, which is to say, a plurality of 25 or 30 percent. When you add up their 1 or 2 or 5 percent each, the other dozen or so candidates have more voters between them, but it counts for absolutely nothing.\nThere is one likely obstacle for Sanders and his outsider-plurality strategy going forward. This is the possibility that Democrats will line up behind a single establishment candidate whose chief virtue for many is that simply that he or she is not Sanders. This is what Republicans failed to do in 2016 when Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich each in turn presented himself as the healthy consensus choice only to find themselves rejected by the party's base.\nThe most obvious person to fill this role in 2020 is, of course, Joe Biden, who has not even announced his candidacy yet. His attempt to apologize without apologizing for his handsy antics will please older voters, but it is unlikely to persuade the crucial but poorly understood bloc of younger Democrats who are socially liberal and fiscally moderate without explicitly acknowledging the latter \u2014 what I think of as the Refinery29 vote. Biden may not be an old white man with some icky misogynistic supporters like Sanders, but he still has too much baggage. There will always be as many arguments against him as there are for him, just as there were always enough reasons on hand for GOP primary voters to convince themselves not to get behind Jeb and Little Marco in 2016.\nSanders's political future is not assured. In addition to defining himself against the competition, he will require a certain amount of luck. The longer his fellow candidates remain in the race, the more successful his strategy is likely to be. The other lesson of the last election is one that he will probably remember \u2014 namely, that a radical outsider stands less of a chance running against one serious establishment candidate. Against the alphabet soup of O'RourkeWarrenButtigiegBookerKlobucharCastroYangGillibrandDelaneyGabbard he is Bernie. Against, say, Kamala Harris with the full backing of the DNC, he is, well, Bernie. That will make all the difference.",

Unlike the self-made wealthy folk of years gone by, Dorsey and a growing number of top-earning tech entrepreneurs aren't swilling vintage champagne and banqueting in their free time. Instead, they're practicing an extreme form of self-denial that has me both troubled and puzzled.</p>\n<p>Dorsey recently <a href=\"https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/lifestyle-podcasts/time-saving-workouts/\">appeared</a> on the <em>Ben Greenfield Fitness</em> podcast to explain his monkish lifestyle in more detail than the 240 character blasts he's known for sending out to the less biologically enlightened universe. He <a href=\"https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/podcast/lifestyle-podcasts/time-saving-workouts/\">says</a> he eats only one meal a day in the week and doesn't let any foodstuff pass his lips at the weekend. He also starts every day with an ice bath. &quot;Nothing has given me more mental confidence than being able to go straight from room temperature into the cold,&quot; he says. And, rain or shine, he walks the five miles from his home to his office. It's all part of his ever-evolving quest to keep his brain functioning at maverick CEO level. And, I suppose, outlive anyone silly enough to think that eating regular, balanced meals is sensible.</p>\n<p>Dorsey's wellness-hacking habits are extrapolated from the ancient Greek and Roman philosophy of Stoicism, which says, essentially, that you should be happy with your lot (arguably not hard if you have a lot) and deny yourself nice things &mdash; like warm baths and calories on days that start with the letter &quot;s.&quot; Stoicism sounds like unscientific celebrity fad nonsense, yet it has a cult-like appeal to a demonstrably smart crew: Silicon Valley's elite.</p>\n<p>Stoicism's aficionados include Kevin Rose, co-founder of the website Digg, who embraces the philosophy by taking cold showers, not putting on a winter coat, and <a href=\"https://dailystoic.com/kevin-rose/\">saying things like</a>, &quot;I try to surrender to the Earth as everything unfolds around me, not judging it, but accepting things as they are.&quot; Which sounds like a lukewarm blend of meditation and shrugging.</p>\n<p>Former Evernote CEO and current CEO of AI studio All Turtles, Phil Libin, regularly says no to food for fasts that last more than a week. He's lost nearly 90 pounds and now bandies around words like &quot;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/phil-libin-fasting-routine-2017-10?r=US&IR=T\">transformative</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>The man who rebooted Stoicism for today's tech moguls is author, podcaster, and tech startup investor Tim Ferriss. He <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/marla-tabaka/tim-ferris-says-you-need-this-superpower-to-achieve-mental-toughness-in-fact-it-saved-his-life.html\">calls the philosophy</a> &quot;an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments.&quot; Maybe it is and maybe it isn't. But one thing is for sure: There's a danger in champions like Dorsey promoting extreme dietary choices that resemble eating disorders to their followers.</p>\n<p>It's also curious, and a little chilling, that this rewrite of the tech elite lifestyle has come about at a time when powerful influencers and innovators are seeing their inventions harnessed by terrible people who do and say terrible things. In Dorsey's case, he's created a platform that has allowed populists, alt-right types, and Russian bots to spread their messages to vast new audiences, creating more chaos than he could possibly have imagined. Twitter undeniably helped make Donald Trump president and gave Britain's Brexiteers a stage. And it's used daily to mete out public shamings and takedowns. Dorsey has experienced how easy it is to create global pandemonium with a laptop and a smidgen of chutzpah.</p>\n<p>So for the Twitter CEO and his kind, trying to control biology with low-grade torture, plus a disinterest in traditional rich-people trappings, may be a kind of self-imposed penance for having built platforms and technology that have unleashed some pretty bad things on the world. I would argue that the motivations of these super-elites are plainly not the same as those of other Silicon Valley workers, who periodically jump on fads like soylent and micro dosing. These larks have more in common with gaming or cosplay, and tie into fanboy fantasies about next-level living in a STEM world.</p>\n<p>Stoicism is different. It asks that its followers dispense with all the sparkle, deliciousness, and fluff, and get back to humble basics. It's a sort of reverse elitism that could also, potentially, blame-proof a tech billionaire's legacy. &quot;I may have invented Twitter,&quot; Dorsey might say. &quot;But I walk to work and vacationed at spiritual retreats that look like refugee camps!&quot;</p>\n<p>Dorsey getting his monk on publicly is winning him as many detractors as fans. Still, if the negativity gets too much, at least he can come home and relax in a nice cold bath.</p>",

Twitter undeniably helped make Donald Trump president and gave Britain's Brexiteers a stage. And it's used daily to mete out public shamings and takedowns. Dorsey has experienced how easy it is to create global pandemonium with a laptop and a smidgen of chutzpah.\nSo for the Twitter CEO and his kind, trying to control biology with low-grade torture, plus a disinterest in traditional rich-people trappings, may be a kind of self-imposed penance for having built platforms and technology that have unleashed some pretty bad things on the world. I would argue that the motivations of these super-elites are plainly not the same as those of other Silicon Valley workers, who periodically jump on fads like soylent and micro dosing. These larks have more in common with gaming or cosplay, and tie into fanboy fantasies about next-level living in a STEM world.\nStoicism is different. It asks that its followers dispense with all the sparkle, deliciousness, and fluff, and get back to humble basics. It's a sort of reverse elitism that could also, potentially, blame-proof a tech billionaire's legacy. \"I may have invented Twitter,\" Dorsey might say. \"But I walk to work and vacationed at spiritual retreats that look like refugee camps!\"\nDorsey getting his monk on publicly is winning him as many detractors as fans. Still, if the negativity gets too much, at least he can come home and relax in a nice cold bath.",

For two years, members of the party's leadership have repeatedly assured voters that they have seen the evidence for collusion with their own eyes. As late as last week, House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) <em>still</em> insisted that evidence of collusion existed, regardless of what Attorney General William Barr wrote in his summary. After Barr published his letter, Democrats doubled down on those allegations by adding accusations that Barr was covering up for his boss. House Judiciary chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) has threatened to subpoena Mueller's full report without redactions, a move that would <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-judiciary-prepares-subpoena-full-mueller-report-n990406&source=gmail&ust=1555528414178000&usg=AFQjCNFCzQvfQdfjMVlV8yqgMxBZ3g9v5w\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-judiciary-prepares-subpoena-full-mueller-report-n990406\">conflict with the law regarding grand jury testimony</a>.</p>\n<p>But if Democrats hope that Thursday's release of the redacted report will corroborate those allegations, they're almost certainly in for another round of disillusion and reduced credibility. A member of Mueller's team has worked with Barr and outgoing deputy AG Rod Rosenstein to properly redact the report. Both Mueller and Rosenstein have been targets of Trump's wrath and have been the subjects of Democratic bills to protect them from being fired by the president. Neither has publicly complained about Barr's letter or the redaction process, which both could have done easily any time after Barr released his summary.</p>\n<p>In fact, Rosenstein went out of his way to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rod-rosenstein-defends-justice-department-handling-of-mueller-report-11555021002\">endorse both last week</a> in an interview with the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. &quot;He's being as forthcoming as he can,&quot; Rosenstein said of Barr, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre.&quot; All Barr intended with the summary letter, Rosenstein explained, was to give the &quot;top-line conclusions&quot; in as timely a manner as possible.</p>\n<p>If that's the case, and the broad strokes of Barr's letter are confirmed by the full report, then Democrats will still be left with an investigation that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. That will expose their previous claims that collusion had already been established as entirely false and may alone be enough to take the wind out of the sails of investigations started by Schiff and Nadler. Even if they find questionable actions and discussions within the Mueller report, their earlier hyperbole raised expectations so high that anything less will be dismissed as hardly worth the bother.</p>\n<p>Oddly enough, Trump and Republicans face a similar problem. Trump has spent the last two years calling the investigation a &quot;witch hunt.&quot; The White House and many Republicans seized on the Barr letter to claim total exoneration for Trump. In that sense, the Barr letter almost certainly represents the high point of the probe for Trump and the GOP. Shorn of the details of the investigation, the conclusions play very well for the president, with the only small downside being Mueller's odd decision to not make a decision on obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>It's that choice that now stands to face the most intense scrutiny, and it seems likely the investigative report will have a pro-con list of actions and declarations that could arguably have justified charging the president. Even with the grand jury testimony redacted, Mueller's investigative report may include a lot of details on Trump campaign activities that may not rise to the level of criminality but were far less than virtuous.</p>\n<p>That risk could also exist in the White House itself. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-officials-concerned-about-being-exposed-mueller-report-n994861\">NBC News</a> heard from several unnamed administration officials who have tried petitioning Barr's office to make sure that they can't be identified in the published report. &quot;They got asked questions and told the truth,&quot; one unnamed official told NBC, &quot;and now they're worried the wrath will follow.&quot; Needless to say, if the &quot;truth&quot; entirely consisted of nothing-to-see-here reminiscences, no one would be worried about having their name attached to them. The likelihood is high that details from the report will keep the White House press office busy for the next several weeks parrying criticisms and that they will make Trump's &quot;<a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/831476/mueller-report-great-trump-says\">the Mueller report was great</a>&quot; victory lap look pretty silly.</p>\n<p>Trump has also insisted that the FBI spied on him in the campaign. That's <em>objectively</em> true, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/834364/barr-says-believes-spying-trump-campaign-did-occur\">as Barr noted</a> in congressional testimony last week, as the investigation started as a counter-intelligence operation fueled by a surveillance warrant approved by a FISA court on Carter Page. That does not make it illegitimate, however, as Barr also noted. If the predicate for the warrant was valid, then the FBI's operation was proper. Trump may be banking on data from the Mueller report justifying accusations that the FBI did not have a valid predicate for the warrant or surveillance and that the operation was politically motivated. If Mueller included that in his report, then Trump might get a big win &mdash; but if Mueller concludes that the FBI did have a valid reason to surveil Page, it's going to burst that narrative bubble in a hurry.</p>\n<p>At this point, however, one has to wonder how engaged voters remain on Russiagate. With all of the indictments now public and no charges for collusion or obstruction resulting from the investigation, it seems most people outside the Beltway will not care terribly much about parsing out the details of Mueller's report.</p>\n<p>Thursday's release will be a letdown for both sides, which may just be what we need to finally move on from the special counsel probe as the center of our political attention.</p>",

NBC News heard from several unnamed administration officials who have tried petitioning Barr's office to make sure that they can't be identified in the published report. \"They got asked questions and told the truth,\" one unnamed official told NBC, \"and now they're worried the wrath will follow.\" Needless to say, if the \"truth\" entirely consisted of nothing-to-see-here reminiscences, no one would be worried about having their name attached to them. The likelihood is high that details from the report will keep the White House press office busy for the next several weeks parrying criticisms and that they will make Trump's \"the Mueller report was great\" victory lap look pretty silly.\nTrump has also insisted that the FBI spied on him in the campaign. That's objectively true, as Barr noted in congressional testimony last week, as the investigation started as a counter-intelligence operation fueled by a surveillance warrant approved by a FISA court on Carter Page. That does not make it illegitimate, however, as Barr also noted. If the predicate for the warrant was valid, then the FBI's operation was proper. Trump may be banking on data from the Mueller report justifying accusations that the FBI did not have a valid predicate for the warrant or surveillance and that the operation was politically motivated. If Mueller included that in his report, then Trump might get a big win \u2014 but if Mueller concludes that the FBI did have a valid reason to surveil Page, it's going to burst that narrative bubble in a hurry.\nAt this point, however, one has to wonder how engaged voters remain on Russiagate. With all of the indictments now public and no charges for collusion or obstruction resulting from the investigation, it seems most people outside the Beltway will not care terribly much about parsing out the details of Mueller's report.\nThursday's release will be a letdown for both sides, which may just be what we need to finally move on from the special counsel probe as the center of our political attention.",

It turns out he is pretty rich. He took in $561,293 in adjusted gross income in 2018 &mdash; but over a million dollars in both 2017 and 2016, when he had a ton of book revenue coming in. That makes him the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/14/us/politics/2020-candidates-tax-returns.html\">third-highest earning</a> Democratic candidate this year, behind Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Sanders is officially in the top 1 percent of income, and this has some wondering if it somehow jams up his political narrative. His &quot;higher income in recent years has created some political awkwardness for the senator, who in his 2016 presidential campaign frequently railed against 'millionaires and billionaires' and their influence over the political process,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes.html\">writes Thomas Kaplan</a> in <em>The</em> <i>New York Times</i>.</p>\n<p>This is nonsense. The only reason to worry about a candidate's income is insofar as it suggests they are either vulnerable to corruption, or have been corrupted. Sanders has made a lot of money, but he is certainly not on the take &mdash; and he will not hesitate to raise his own taxes if he gets a chance.</p>\n<p>The obvious truth as to why Sanders is rich is that he is very famous, and it is extremely easy to capitalize on fame. All he had to do was write a book &mdash; or even easier, pay someone else to do it, though reportedly <a href=\"https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/book-review-our-revolution-a-future-to-believe-in-sen-bernie-sanders/Content?oid=3839331\">Sanders did not use a ghostwriter</a>. He probably could have gotten a lot more if he had been strategic about it. Just look how Kim Kardashian <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-who-has-higher-net-worth.html/\">makes more money</a> than her husband Kanye West.</p>\n<p>What matters here is the <i>method</i> by which politicians and ex-politicians capitalize on that fame.</p>\n<p>For instance, the usual buckraking speech tour of big Wall Street banks that ex-politicians routinely carry out is objectionable because of corruption. Do bankers really care about hearing some probably platitudinous 40-minute speech? No, they are paying for <i>access</i> to potential future senators and presidents, and to create the reward pathway of banker-friendly politicos getting plausibly-deniable bribes if they govern the way bankers want.</p>\n<p>Leftists and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/4/25/15419740/obama-speaking-fee\">even liberals like Matt Yglesias</a> argued that Barack Obama should not have taken a $400,000 fee to speak at the bond firm Cantor Fitzgerald because it undermines the legitimacy of his (<a href=\"https://www.theweek.com/articles/797114/quiet-authoritarianism-bank-bailout\"><i>incredibly</i> banker-friendly</a>) bailout record. &quot;Did you really avoid breaking up the big banks because you thought it would undermine financial stability, or were you on the take?&quot; writes Yglesias. But nobody cared about the <i>much</i> larger <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/3/2/14779892/barack-michelle-obama-65-million-book-deal-penguin-random-house\">$65 million</a> book advance Obama got, because there isn't some Big Reader lobby that is pushing for book subsidies or something.</p>\n<p>And unlike President Trump, Sanders doesn't have some vast business empire. On the contrary, even with his book money he is still towards the bottom of the <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/wealth-of-congress\">congressional net worth rankings</a>, with wealth of about <a href=\"https://thenetworthportal.com/wiki-2018-2019-2020-2021/politician/bernie-sanders-net-worth/\">$1 million</a> &mdash; a tiny fraction of Rep. Greg Gianforte's (R-Mont.) $136 million or Rep. Jared Polis' (D-Colo.) $122 million.</p>\n<p>Nor is there any suggestion that Sanders would moderate his anti-plutocratic politics to benefit him personally. On the contrary, he promised to raise his taxes sharply in the statement accompanying the release of his returns: &quot;I will continue to fight to make our tax system more progressive so that our country has the resources to guarantee the American Dream to all people.&quot; Indeed, Sanders would no doubt love to have had much higher taxes in the past so as to keep his wealth from getting even that high. As James Adomian's Sanders parody character put it in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jadomian/status/1117258679445667840\">a video about him scrambling to finish his tax return</a>: &quot;They are not taxing me at a high enough rate. Jane, is there any way we can pay an alternative <i>maximum</i> tax?&quot;</p>\n<p>It would be wise for Sanders to make these points explicitly. So far he has been (as usual) a little prickly about his money, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/13/politics/bernie-sanders-millionaire-book-sales-tax-returns/index.html\">saying</a> &quot;I didn't know it was a crime to write a good book.&quot; A little jaunty humor about soaking himself to pay for Medicare-for-all would go a long way.</p>\n<p>Still, there is something peculiar in the notion that only personally impoverished people can hold leftist views &mdash; as if <a href=\"https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha\">one can't be a critic of capitalism and own an iPhone</a>. The effect is to foreclose any realistic leftist politics, since poor people have zero political power &mdash; and as we have seen, anyone who becomes a national figure becomes rich almost automatically. Of course, wealth often does influence someone's views, but it's not determinative &mdash; the most egalitarian president in American history, Franklin Roosevelt, was a scion of extreme wealth and privilege, <i>far</i> richer than Sanders will ever be.</p>\n<p>So one might fault Sanders for <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/04/why-bernie-sanders-should-give-his-millions-away\">not donating that much to charity</a> &mdash; though that is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/interfluidity/status/1118199554388578305\">no substitute</a> for a proper welfare state. But there is no reason to question his (or <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/834830/elizabeth-warren-everything-hillary-clinton-pretended\">Elizabeth Warren's</a>, for that matter) egalitarian political commitments.</p>",

On the contrary, even with his book money he is still towards the bottom of the congressional net worth rankings, with wealth of about $1 million \u2014 a tiny fraction of Rep. Greg Gianforte's (R-Mont.) $136 million or Rep. Jared Polis' (D-Colo.) $122 million.\nNor is there any suggestion that Sanders would moderate his anti-plutocratic politics to benefit him personally. On the contrary, he promised to raise his taxes sharply in the statement accompanying the release of his returns: \"I will continue to fight to make our tax system more progressive so that our country has the resources to guarantee the American Dream to all people.\" Indeed, Sanders would no doubt love to have had much higher taxes in the past so as to keep his wealth from getting even that high. As James Adomian's Sanders parody character put it in a video about him scrambling to finish his tax return: \"They are not taxing me at a high enough rate. Jane, is there any way we can pay an alternative maximum tax?\"\nIt would be wise for Sanders to make these points explicitly. So far he has been (as usual) a little prickly about his money, saying \"I didn't know it was a crime to write a good book.\" A little jaunty humor about soaking himself to pay for Medicare-for-all would go a long way.\nStill, there is something peculiar in the notion that only personally impoverished people can hold leftist views \u2014 as if one can't be a critic of capitalism and own an iPhone. The effect is to foreclose any realistic leftist politics, since poor people have zero political power \u2014 and as we have seen, anyone who becomes a national figure becomes rich almost automatically. Of course, wealth often does influence someone's views, but it's not determinative \u2014 the most egalitarian president in American history, Franklin Roosevelt, was a scion of extreme wealth and privilege, far richer than Sanders will ever be.\nSo one might fault Sanders for not donating that much to charity \u2014 though that is no substitute for a proper welfare state. But there is no reason to question his (or Elizabeth Warren's, for that matter) egalitarian political commitments.",

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) misspoke. In a speech about Islam and civil liberties in America, she described the 9/11 attacks with a phrase &mdash; &quot;some people did something&quot; &mdash; far too casual. <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/834577/why-conservative-attacks-outofcontext-ilhan-omar-quote-are-dangerous\">In context</a>, Omar's words were an inartful expression of a legitimate frustration: that, in the wake of this horror, the U.S. security state went into hyperdrive, and the rights of the innocent many were violated because of the abhorrent deeds of the guilty few. Out of context, her words <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/834619/new-york-post-inflammatory-response-rep-ilhan-omars-911-comments\">have become</a> a jingoistic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1115947036644392961\">cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</a>.</p>\n<p>Naturally, President Trump got in on the action, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/835098/trumps-response-comments-from-rep-ilhan-omar-came-form-graphic-911-footage-twitter\">tweeting a video</a> which juxtaposed Omar's phrase with graphic footage of the terror attacks. Omar <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/04/14/pelosi-trump-tweet-omar-video\">reported receiving</a> a &quot;sharp increase&quot; in death threats after the tweet, many of them explicitly referencing Trump's post. But, presented with this information by a local reporter while visiting Omar's home state on Monday, the president was unconcerned.</p>\n<p>He had no second thoughts about the tweet, <a href=\"https://theweek.com/speedreads/835438/trump-says-no-regrets-over-ilhan-omar911-video-way-about-thats-bad\">Trump said</a>, &quot;not at all.&quot; Omar has &quot;got a way about her that's very, very bad, I think, for our country,&quot; he continued. &quot;I think she's extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.&quot;</p>\n<p>The logic here is stunning: For those who demonstrate insufficient patriotism, death threats are no problem. In fact, they may even be appropriate. Fail to adequately perform uncritical affection for the United States and it will be noticed and punished. Real Americans police each other's patriotism, Trump seems to be saying, and those who are &quot;extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country&quot; cannot expect to get off scot-free.</p>\n<p>Of course, it goes without saying that controversial speech will have consequences. Omar could not anticipate &mdash; and I very much doubt she <em>did</em> anticipate &mdash; that her speech would be met with universal agreement or even silence from those who don't share her views. No politician with a national profile would be naive enough to imagine she could avoid confrontation; in this very speech, in fact, Omar <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/mar/24/ilhan-omar-ciar-speech-tells-muslims-raise-hell/\">called on</a> American Muslims to be willing to &quot;make people uncomfortable&quot; in their civil rights activism if necessary.</p>\n<p>But there is a chasm between the consequences Omar could have rightfully expected (criticism, denunciation, lost votes, lost office) and those she got (death threats, fueled in part by a tweet from the president, who does not regret his role in inspiring what are hopefully empty menaces to Omar's life). The former is appropriate and normal &mdash; part of participating in public conversation in a country like ours. The latter is what happens when <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/726750/big-patriotism-poisoning-america\">patriotism goes awry</a>, when devotion to the nation-state takes a turn toward <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/832532/dont-idolize-2020-pick\">the idolatrous</a>, when we stop wanting what is best for our communities <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/726750/big-patriotism-poisoning-america\">and simply want</a> to be the best, unchallenged by even what is intended as constructive critique.</p>\n<p>This poisonous sort of patriotism &mdash; I'll use Trump's word, though &quot;nationalism&quot; would serve as well &mdash; is jealous and officious by nature. It demands to be complete, so it requires its observants be ever vigilant for dissent. The result is what the Cato Institute's Alex Nowrasteh has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/07/the-right-has-its-own-version-of-political-correctness-its-just-as-stifling/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b05f45ed9654\">astutely dubbed</a> &quot;patriotic correctness&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It's a full-throated, un-nuanced, uncompromising defense of American nationalism, history, and cherry-picked ideals. Central to its thesis is the belief that nothing in America can't be fixed by more patriotism enforced by public shaming, boycotts, and policies to cut out foreign and non-American influences. Insufficient displays of patriotism among the patriotically correct can result in exclusion from public life and ruined careers. It also restricts honest criticism of failed public policies, diverting blame for things like the war in Iraq to those Americans who didn't support the war effort enough. [Alex Nowrasteh via <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/07/the-right-has-its-own-version-of-political-correctness-its-just-as-stifling/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b05f45ed9654\">The Washington Post</a></em>]</p> </blockquote>\n<p>For those operating with a full-blown case of patriotic correctness &mdash; and Trump is unquestionably one of the fever's Typhoid Marys &mdash; &quot;anything less than chest-thumping jingoism is capitulation&quot; to those perceived to be America's enemies, Nowrasteh writes. It is, in effect, a type of treason (which, recall, is a death penalty offense. Trump's comfort with his role in Omar's receipt of death threats makes a certain grim sense by this rationale).</p>\n<p>Thus it is no surprise to find Trump employing &ldquo;treason&rdquo; language with some regularity. &quot;I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS,&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1116167275948597249\">he tweeted</a> last week, two days before posting the Omar video. This is a blatantly <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/trump-treason/586915/\">false accusation</a>: Democrats' border security policies, whatever we think of them, simply do not fit the Constitution's intentionally precise definition of treason, which was narrowly <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/americans-have-forgotten-what-treason-actually-means-how-it-can-ncna848651\">crafted to avoid</a> the abuse of this charge practiced by the monarchs of old Europe.</p>\n<p>Kings who claimed to govern by divine right could levy charges of treason to suppress public dissent. Presidents of a nation ostensibly governed by its people &mdash; people who disagree on many things, immigration and our policy response to 9/11 both included &mdash; are not supposed to do the same.</p>\n<p>That Trump does so, and that he does it with the support or at least indifference of so many, should serve as a glaring warning against the ugliness the patriotic correctness he practices can produce. Any demand of loyalty that has us making, condoning, or downplaying threats of murder over a crude turn of phrase is <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/726750/big-patriotism-poisoning-america\">a loyalty imbalanced</a>. It does not benefit our country, and it is no virtue.</p>",

                "text": "Illlustrated | Screenshot/@RealDonaldTrump on Twitter, iStock/STILLFX, iStock/The7Dew\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) misspoke. In a speech about Islam and civil liberties in America, she described the 9/11 attacks with a phrase \u2014 \"some people did something\" \u2014 far too casual. In context, Omar's words were an inartful expression of a legitimate frustration: that, in the wake of this horror, the U.S. security state went into hyperdrive, and the rights of the innocent many were violated because of the abhorrent deeds of the guilty few. Out of context, her words have become a jingoistic cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\nNaturally, President Trump got in on the action, tweeting a video which juxtaposed Omar's phrase with graphic footage of the terror attacks. Omar reported receiving a \"sharp increase\" in death threats after the tweet, many of them explicitly referencing Trump's post. But, presented with this information by a local reporter while visiting Omar's home state on Monday, the president was unconcerned.\nHe had no second thoughts about the tweet, Trump said, \"not at all.\" Omar has \"got a way about her that's very, very bad, I think, for our country,\" he continued. \"I think she's extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country.\"\nThe logic here is stunning: For those who demonstrate insufficient patriotism, death threats are no problem. In fact, they may even be appropriate. Fail to adequately perform uncritical affection for the United States and it will be noticed and punished. Real Americans police each other's patriotism, Trump seems to be saying, and those who are \"extremely unpatriotic and extremely disrespectful to our country\" cannot expect to get off scot-free.\nOf course, it goes without saying that controversial speech will have consequences. Omar could not anticipate \u2014 and I very much doubt she did anticipate \u2014 that her speech would be met with universal agreement or even silence from those who don't share her views. No politician with a national profile would be naive enough to imagine she could avoid confrontation; in this very speech, in fact, Omar called on American Muslims to be willing to \"make people uncomfortable\" in their civil rights activism if necessary.\nBut there is a chasm between the consequences Omar could have rightfully expected (criticism, denunciation, lost votes, lost office) and those she got (death threats, fueled in part by a tweet from the president, who does not regret his role in inspiring what are hopefully empty menaces to Omar's life). The former is appropriate and normal \u2014 part of participating in public conversation in a country like ours. The latter is what happens when patriotism goes awry, when devotion to the nation-state takes a turn toward the idolatrous, when we stop wanting what is best for our communities and simply want to be the best, unchallenged by even what is intended as constructive critique.\nThis poisonous sort of patriotism \u2014 I'll use Trump's word, though \"nationalism\" would serve as well \u2014 is jealous and officious by nature. It demands to be complete, so it requires its observants be ever vigilant for dissent. The result is what the Cato Institute's Alex Nowrasteh has astutely dubbed \"patriotic correctness\":\nIt's a full-throated, un-nuanced, uncompromising defense of American nationalism, history, and cherry-picked ideals. Central to its thesis is the belief that nothing in America can't be fixed by more patriotism enforced by public shaming, boycotts, and policies to cut out foreign and non-American influences. Insufficient displays of patriotism among the patriotically correct can result in exclusion from public life and ruined careers. It also restricts honest criticism of failed public policies, diverting blame for things like the war in Iraq to those Americans who didn't support the war effort enough. [Alex Nowrasteh via The Washington Post]\nFor those operating with a full-blown case of patriotic correctness \u2014 and Trump is unquestionably one of the fever's Typhoid Marys \u2014 \"anything less than chest-thumping jingoism is capitulation\" to those perceived to be America's enemies, Nowrasteh writes. It is, in effect, a type of treason (which, recall, is a death penalty offense. Trump's comfort with his role in Omar's receipt of death threats makes a certain grim sense by this rationale).\nThus it is no surprise to find Trump employing \u201ctreason\u201d language with some regularity. \"I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS,\" he tweeted last week, two days before posting the Omar video. This is a blatantly false accusation: Democrats' border security policies, whatever we think of them, simply do not fit the Constitution's intentionally precise definition of treason, which was narrowly crafted to avoid the abuse of this charge practiced by the monarchs of old Europe.\nKings who claimed to govern by divine right could levy charges of treason to suppress public dissent. Presidents of a nation ostensibly governed by its people \u2014 people who disagree on many things, immigration and our policy response to 9/11 both included \u2014 are not supposed to do the same.\nThat Trump does so, and that he does it with the support or at least indifference of so many, should serve as a glaring warning against the ugliness the patriotic correctness he practices can produce. Any demand of loyalty that has us making, condoning, or downplaying threats of murder over a crude turn of phrase is a loyalty imbalanced. It does not benefit our country, and it is no virtue.",

But it ended up serving as an elegy.</p>\n<p>Nearly four decades later, one can imagine those words being recited as a morale-booster at a meeting of dead-ender Never-Trump Republicans as they mull over who should rise to the challenge of taking on the sitting president in next year's GOP primaries. Will it be Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan? Or Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich? This week <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bill-weld-launches-campaign-against-trump-for-2020-republican-nomination/2019/04/15/792a14f0-5fad-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html?utm_term=.094013f41e54\">we learned</a> that it would be former Massachusetts Gov. (and Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee) William Weld.</p>\n<p>Running for president is extremely difficult. Attempting to torpedo a president of one's own party seeking re-election is nearly always something close to a political suicide mission. For all those reasons, we should accord anyone willing to make the attempt a modicum of respect. That certainly holds for Weld.</p>\n<p>But that doesn't mean the effort makes sense. In this case, it makes no sense at all. Yes, President Trump is vulnerable in 2020. But he's not vulnerable because the Republican electorate is pining for the opportunity to vote for another Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney &mdash; let alone a Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney who, like Weld, is pro-choice. The only kind of Republican who would have a shot of defeating the president in a primary would be a more competent Trumpist than Trump himself.</p>\n<p>The tiny faction of the Republican Party that openly loathes Trump enough to want to see him brought down in a kamikaze mission &mdash; a faction that enjoys outsized attention because it is vastly overrepresented in the media &mdash; has misread him from the start. First these Republicans considered Trump a sideshow and a buffoon whose sky-high poll numbers in the months leading up the start of 2016 primary season meant nothing. Surely the voters would come around and cast ballots for Bush or Kasich or Marco Rubio or Chris Christie or (God forbid) Ted Cruz over the reality-show carnival barker.</p>\n<p>Then they assumed Trump's string of early primary victories would give way to defeat once the anybody-but-Trump vote coalesced around a suitable alternative. Then they were sure Trump's clinching of the nomination would be overturned at the Republican National Convention. Then they were convinced he would lose in a landslide to Hillary Clinton. When he didn't, many of them came to believe, finally, that he was certain to be removed from office by impeachment, a Robert-Mueller-facilitated indictment, or the invocation of the 25th Amendment.</p>\n<p>They've been wrong every step of the way. And they are wrong now.</p>\n<p>There are Republicans who wish Trump would tone down his unpresidential tweeting, and some who are offended by his tabloid bluster. But there are hardly <em>any</em> who are anything other than thrilled with his administration's commitment to cutting taxes and regulations, appointing conservative judges and Supreme Court justices, pulling back from our overseas obligations, and &quot;trigging the libs&quot; on every possible front of the culture war (including some that Trump is single-handedly responsible for opening up).</p>\n<p>That's why, even after more than two years of scandal and unprecedented political turbulence in Washington, <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">roughly 90 percent</a> of Republicans approve of the president's performance. That doesn't mean they like him personally or would invite him to date their daughters. It means they like how he's doing his job.</p>\n<p>That's true even in New Hampshire, where voters have a history of using their narrative-forming-first-primary-in-the-nation advantage to throw wrenches into the best-laid political plans. While a February <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/new-hampshire/\">poll showed</a> Weld pulling in a not-entirely-humiliating 18 percent against the president, that still left Trump with an overwhelming 82 percent of Republican support. (Since Weld held office just across the border in Massachusetts, he's hardly an unknown quantity in the Granite State.)</p>\n<p>By contrast, in the most notorious challenge to a sitting president in recent history, Pat Buchanan managed to win more than double that (37.5 percent) against George H. W. Bush in the 1992 New Hampshire primary. It's become conventional wisdom that Buchanan's challenge to Bush from the right weakened him greatly, preparing the way for Bill Clinton's victory. Indeed, those looking to sink Trump hope that something similar will play out in 2020. There's just one thing missing from the plan: Ross Perot. Were it not for Perot's independent bid for the presidency in 1992, Bush may well have won re-election. It was the one-two punch of Buchanan slamming him from the right in the primaries followed by Perot hitting him from the center that did Bush in.</p>\n<p>A centrist-libertarian challenge to Trump in the primaries isn't going to go anywhere. The only thing that would have any (though still very small) chance of success would be a campaign from the same ideological quadrant the president occupies: right-wing populism. It would have to be a Trump without the unpresidential tweets, a Trump who can keep his eye on the ball, who isn't constantly undermining himself with performative contradictions and flagrant displays of rank ineptitude. This doesn't mean the promise of a nicer president. It means the promise of an equally nasty but far more competent president &mdash; one who could accomplish even more for the Trumpified right.</p>\n<p>That isn't at all what Weld and his allies have in mind.</p>\n<p>Donald Trump owns the Republican Party. He has remade it in his own image. We needn't cheer that transformation &mdash; I certainly don't &mdash; to recognize its reality. Those currently plotting to take him down in the primaries will lose because they have already lost the battle for the party's soul.</p>",

                "text": "\"The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\"\nTed Kennedy's old line, delivered at the Democratic National Convention just three short months before Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter, was intended as a rallying cry for the confident liberalism that had set the tone and agenda for the nation's politics over the previous three decades. But it ended up serving as an elegy.\nNearly four decades later, one can imagine those words being recited as a morale-booster at a meeting of dead-ender Never-Trump Republicans as they mull over who should rise to the challenge of taking on the sitting president in next year's GOP primaries. Will it be Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan? Or Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich? This week we learned that it would be former Massachusetts Gov. (and Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee) William Weld.\nRunning for president is extremely difficult. Attempting to torpedo a president of one's own party seeking re-election is nearly always something close to a political suicide mission. For all those reasons, we should accord anyone willing to make the attempt a modicum of respect. That certainly holds for Weld.\nBut that doesn't mean the effort makes sense. In this case, it makes no sense at all. Yes, President Trump is vulnerable in 2020. But he's not vulnerable because the Republican electorate is pining for the opportunity to vote for another Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney \u2014 let alone a Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney who, like Weld, is pro-choice. The only kind of Republican who would have a shot of defeating the president in a primary would be a more competent Trumpist than Trump himself.\nThe tiny faction of the Republican Party that openly loathes Trump enough to want to see him brought down in a kamikaze mission \u2014 a faction that enjoys outsized attention because it is vastly overrepresented in the media \u2014 has misread him from the start. First these Republicans considered Trump a sideshow and a buffoon whose sky-high poll numbers in the months leading up the start of 2016 primary season meant nothing. Surely the voters would come around and cast ballots for Bush or Kasich or Marco Rubio or Chris Christie or (God forbid) Ted Cruz over the reality-show carnival barker.\nThen they assumed Trump's string of early primary victories would give way to defeat once the anybody-but-Trump vote coalesced around a suitable alternative. Then they were sure Trump's clinching of the nomination would be overturned at the Republican National Convention. Then they were convinced he would lose in a landslide to Hillary Clinton. When he didn't, many of them came to believe, finally, that he was certain to be removed from office by impeachment, a Robert-Mueller-facilitated indictment, or the invocation of the 25th Amendment.\nThey've been wrong every step of the way. And they are wrong now.\nThere are Republicans who wish Trump would tone down his unpresidential tweeting, and some who are offended by his tabloid bluster. But there are hardly any who are anything other than thrilled with his administration's commitment to cutting taxes and regulations, appointing conservative judges and Supreme Court justices, pulling back from our overseas obligations, and \"trigging the libs\" on every possible front of the culture war (including some that Trump is single-handedly responsible for opening up).\nThat's why, even after more than two years of scandal and unprecedented political turbulence in Washington, roughly 90 percent of Republicans approve of the president's performance. That doesn't mean they like him personally or would invite him to date their daughters. It means they like how he's doing his job.\nThat's true even in New Hampshire, where voters have a history of using their narrative-forming-first-primary-in-the-nation advantage to throw wrenches into the best-laid political plans. While a February poll showed Weld pulling in a not-entirely-humiliating 18 percent against the president, that still left Trump with an overwhelming 82 percent of Republican support. (Since Weld held office just across the border in Massachusetts, he's hardly an unknown quantity in the Granite State.)\nBy contrast, in the most notorious challenge to a sitting president in recent history, Pat Buchanan managed to win more than double that (37.5 percent) against George H. W. Bush in the 1992 New Hampshire primary. It's become conventional wisdom that Buchanan's challenge to Bush from the right weakened him greatly, preparing the way for Bill Clinton's victory. Indeed, those looking to sink Trump hope that something similar will play out in 2020. There's just one thing missing from the plan: Ross Perot. Were it not for Perot's independent bid for the presidency in 1992, Bush may well have won re-election. It was the one-two punch of Buchanan slamming him from the right in the primaries followed by Perot hitting him from the center that did Bush in.\nA centrist-libertarian challenge to Trump in the primaries isn't going to go anywhere. The only thing that would have any (though still very small) chance of success would be a campaign from the same ideological quadrant the president occupies: right-wing populism. It would have to be a Trump without the unpresidential tweets, a Trump who can keep his eye on the ball, who isn't constantly undermining himself with performative contradictions and flagrant displays of rank ineptitude. This doesn't mean the promise of a nicer president. It means the promise of an equally nasty but far more competent president \u2014 one who could accomplish even more for the Trumpified right.\nThat isn't at all what Weld and his allies have in mind.\nDonald Trump owns the Republican Party. He has remade it in his own image. We needn't cheer that transformation \u2014 I certainly don't \u2014 to recognize its reality. Those currently plotting to take him down in the primaries will lose because they have already lost the battle for the party's soul.",
