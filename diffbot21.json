Morgan&rsquo;s Chase Bank has made a name for itself in recent years for donating big-dollar sums to liberal causes (see it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/04/13/jpmorgan-chase-limits-business-gunmakers-while-wells-fargo-continues/515430002/\">announcement</a> that it will no longer do business with the gun industry) and now it has started targeting conservative customers for their political views. </strong></p>\n<p>A number of prominent conservative activists have had their accounts suspended by Chase Bank in recent weeks. Martina Markota, Jordan Peterson, Milo Yiannopolous and Enrique Tarrio have all been targeted for their political beliefs.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how conservatives could be even more complacent than they actually are about what&rsquo;s being done to this country.</p>\n<p>PJ Media <a href=\"https://pjmedia.com/trending/time-for-action-chase-bank-denies-service-to-conservatives/\">report</a>: The schools our children are taught in are almost universally run by liberals who hate everything we stand for, but we don&rsquo;t demand that our representatives pull funding from state schools that behave that way.</p>\n<p>Hollywood has become vocally, over-the-top hostile to Christians and conservatives, but we go see the movies anyway.</p>\n<p>Ads by Revcontent</p>\n<p>We still buy the papers and watch the cable news shows of networks that talk about us like we&rsquo;re Nazis because we don&rsquo;t agree with their liberal worldview.</p>\n<p>More recently, increasingly monopolistic social media companies that have an inordinate amount of control over who gets heard and who doesn&rsquo;t have started actively targeting conservatives and we just shrug or spout platitudes.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;<em>If you don&rsquo;t like the way they do it, take on those monopolies with hundreds of millions of users and billions in cash by building your own company.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p>So, what happens when banks and credit card companies target people for their political views?

So was Martina Markota. And Joe Biggs, who made enough of a stink that Chase reluctantly gave him his account back.</p>\n<p>Banking is one of the most heavily regulated industries in America for a good reason &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not just because the bankers can steal your money. The idea that citizens could be cut off from using a bank because of their political views is extremely dangerous.</p>\n<p>Imagine going to your bank and being told to produce your voter registration before you&rsquo;re allowed to open an account or get a credit card.</p>\n<p>If Chase is allowed to do this, we are taking a step into that world. A world where your political views could keep you from being able to get credit or run a business. Certainly, there are an awful lot of liberals who would love to see us enter a world like that.</p>\n<p>In fact, there was a column in the New York Times last year calling for weaponizing the financial industry in exactly this way to shut down the gun industry as part of an effort to deny Americans their Second Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>Republicans in the Senate should demand that Chase executives come before them and answer some hard questions about targeting customers for their political views. Maybe we need to rewrite banking regulations to make sure this kind of discrimination can&rsquo;t occur.</p>\n<p>I tell you what&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;: Republicans in Congress should at least let banks know that they are paying attention to this issue and that there could be rather severe consequences for Chase or, alternately, for the whole industry if this practice spreads.</p>",

Morgan\u2019s Chase Bank has made a name for itself in recent years for donating big-dollar sums to liberal causes (see it\u2019s announcement that it will no longer do business with the gun industry) and now it has started targeting conservative customers for their political views.\nA number of prominent conservative activists have had their accounts suspended by Chase Bank in recent weeks. Martina Markota, Jordan Peterson, Milo Yiannopolous and Enrique Tarrio have all been targeted for their political beliefs.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine how conservatives could be even more complacent than they actually are about what\u2019s being done to this country.\nPJ Media report: The schools our children are taught in are almost universally run by liberals who hate everything we stand for, but we don\u2019t demand that our representatives pull funding from state schools that behave that way.\nHollywood has become vocally, over-the-top hostile to Christians and conservatives, but we go see the movies anyway.\nAds by Revcontent\nWe still buy the papers and watch the cable news shows of networks that talk about us like we\u2019re Nazis because we don\u2019t agree with their liberal worldview.\nMore recently, increasingly monopolistic social media companies that have an inordinate amount of control over who gets heard and who doesn\u2019t have started actively targeting conservatives and we just shrug or spout platitudes.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the way they do it, take on those monopolies with hundreds of millions of users and billions in cash by building your own company.\u201d\nSo, what happens when banks and credit card companies target people for their political views? Do we need to build our own banks, too?\nActivist Laura Loomer, who has already been banned by PayPal, claims she had her account suspended by Chase Bank.\nEnrique Tarrio, the black leader of the Proud Boys, a group that has laughably been branded a white supremacist organization by liberals, was also suspended by Chase. So was Martina Markota. And Joe Biggs, who made enough of a stink that Chase reluctantly gave him his account back.\nBanking is one of the most heavily regulated industries in America for a good reason \u2013 and it\u2019s not just because the bankers can steal your money. The idea that citizens could be cut off from using a bank because of their political views is extremely dangerous.\nImagine going to your bank and being told to produce your voter registration before you\u2019re allowed to open an account or get a credit card.\nIf Chase is allowed to do this, we are taking a step into that world. A world where your political views could keep you from being able to get credit or run a business. Certainly, there are an awful lot of liberals who would love to see us enter a world like that.\nIn fact, there was a column in the New York Times last year calling for weaponizing the financial industry in exactly this way to shut down the gun industry as part of an effort to deny Americans their Second Amendment rights.\nRepublicans in the Senate should demand that Chase executives come before them and answer some hard questions about targeting customers for their political views. Maybe we need to rewrite banking regulations to make sure this kind of discrimination can\u2019t occur.\nI tell you what\u2019s not a \u201cmaybe\u201d: Republicans in Congress should at least let banks know that they are paying attention to this issue and that there could be rather severe consequences for Chase or, alternately, for the whole industry if this practice spreads.",

Congressional testimonies by high ranking FBI officials involved in the investigation reveal, however, that this was not the case.</p>\n<p>The testimonies, which were conducted last year behind closed-doors, have not been publicly released, but were reviewed for this article.</p>\n<p><strong>DOJ Involvement in Clinton Case &amp; Requirement of Intent</strong></p>\n<p>Lisa Page, an FBI lawyer who served as special counsel to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe during the time of the Clinton investigation, noted during her testimony in July 2018, that the DOJ was intimately involved in the investigation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Everybody talks about this as if this was the FBI investigation, and the truth of the matter is there was not a single step, other than the July 5th statement, there was not a single investigative step that we did not do in consultation with or at the direction of the Justice Department,&rdquo; Page told congressional investigators on July 13, 2018.</p>\n<p>Comey had also hinted at the influence exerted by the DOJ over the Clinton investigation in his July <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system\">recommendation</a>, stating that &ldquo;there are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Intent is a requirement of several statutes the FBI was looking into. But intent is specifically not a factor under the charge of gross negligence&mdash;contained within <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793\">18 U.S. Code &sect; 793(f)</a>&mdash;a fact that was brought up by Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) during Page&rsquo;s testimony:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rep. Ratcliffe</strong>: Okay. And that&rsquo;s &mdash; I think, when you talk about intent, that&rsquo;s certainly true under part of 18 793(f), but it sounds like you all just blew over gross negligence.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Ms. Page</strong>: We did not blow over gross negligence. We, in fact &mdash; and, in fact, the Director &mdash; because on its face, it did seem like, well, maybe there&rsquo;s a potential here for this to be the charge. And we had multiple conversations, multiple conversations with the Justice Department about charging gross negligence.</em></p>\n<p>Page made clear during her testimony that the DOJ had decided that due to &ldquo;constitutional vagueness&rdquo; a charge of gross negligence would not be supported without accompanying proof of intent&mdash;a seemingly oxymoronic position:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Rep. Ratcliffe</strong>: Okay. So let me if I can, I know I&rsquo;m testing your memory, but when you say advice you got from the Department, you&rsquo;re making it sound like it was the Department that told you: You&rsquo;re not going to charge gross negligence because we&rsquo;re the prosecutors and we&rsquo;re telling you we&rsquo;re not going to &mdash;</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Ms. Page</strong>: That is correct.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Rep. Ratcliffe</strong>: &mdash; bring a case based on that.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Trouble Defining Intent</strong></p>\n<p>The word &ldquo;intent&rdquo; drove the entirety of the FBI&rsquo;s investigation into the Clinton email server.</p>\n<p>It appears, however, that there were differing understandings of the word &ldquo;intent&rdquo; within the FBI. Trisha Anderson, the No. 2 lawyer at the FBI, told investigators that what she viewed as intent was &ldquo;an email that the Secretary sent saying, I set up this server for the purpose of sending unclassified information for my convenience, even though I know it&rsquo;s not a secure system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Page viewed the situation somewhat differently, agreeing they were looking for &ldquo;an intent to do an act which is in violation of the law&rsquo;s central command.&rdquo; As she told investigators, the FBI &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t find any indicia of knowledge that she knew that these [classified emails] shouldn&rsquo;t be traversing her server.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Anderson&rsquo;s understanding, she was looking for a prosecutable reason behind the establishment of the server itself. Page, however, was looking at whether Clinton knew which emails should not have traveled through the private server.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bill Priestap, head of the FBI&rsquo;s counterintelligence division and who was officially in charge of the Clinton investigation, said during testimony that he thought the &ldquo;number of instances is absolutely a proper consideration&rdquo; in establishing intent.</p>\n<p>According to Ryan Breitenbach, who was the House Majority Counsel at the time of Priestap&rsquo;s interview, the State Department had identified 22 top-secret emails and 1,300 classified emails on Clinton&rsquo;s email server. As Breitenbach noted to Priestap during testimony, &ldquo;I think there might be many who would question whether people in this room would still be in this room if we had hit 1,300 emails on our personal Gmail service.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>&lsquo;DOJ Not Willing to Charge This&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>Priestap was shown an email sent from an unknown individual in the FBI general counsel&rsquo;s office to Priestap&rsquo;s former boss, Michael Steinbach, which contained a chart of &ldquo;available statutes for prosecuting the former Secretary of State.&rdquo; Gross Negligence was specifically excluded from the chargeable statutes available to the FBI. Priestap, who had not previously seen the document, expressed concerns that this might have hindered the work of FBI investigators.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: We see in this chart that DOJ is not willing to charge this, meaning 18 U.S.C. 793(f). My question is going back to those draft affidavits. If DOJ is not willing to charge this statute, why would the FBI in an affidavit use this statute as predication to obtain a search warrant if this statute is never going to be prosecuted?</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Priestap</strong>: So I &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know who put this together and used this language.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: Well, someone in the FBI general counsel&rsquo;s office.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Priestap</strong>: Yeah. No. No. I trust you. But I don&rsquo;t know why they, again, put it together. I don&rsquo;t know why they used this language, &lsquo;DOJ not willing to charge this.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p><em>My attitude is that if there is a Federal criminal statute still on the books, then, you know &mdash; and we think there may or might be a violation of that, we still have to work to uncover whether, in fact, there was.</em></p>\n<p><em>The prosecutive history of a particular statute isn&rsquo;t going to affect &mdash; I sure hope it does not affect the fact-finder&rsquo;s work.</em></p>\n<p>Priestap said that it was his understanding that the gross negligence standard had not been met&mdash;as opposed to not pursued&mdash;in the Clinton case. As Priestap noted, &ldquo;if I understood from the department that they would never charge a particular statute, I would want to know that before I&rsquo;m going to dedicate resources to a particular topic. I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Lisa Page, a lawyer by training, seemed to have a very different understanding of what would be allowed by the DOJ. Page appeared to indicate during her testimony that because of the DOJ&rsquo;s position, there was no reason for the FBI to even pursue evidence related to the specific statute of gross negligence.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s assume things are going swimmingly and, in fact, all 17 of those witnesses admit, &lsquo;We did it, it was on purpose, we totally wanted to mishandle classified information,&rsquo; gross negligence would still have been off the table because of the department&rsquo;s assessment that it was vague. We would have other crimes to now charge, but gross negligence would not have been among them.&rdquo; Page said in her testimony.</p>\n<p>FBI General Counsel James Baker, who called Clinton&rsquo;s behavior &ldquo;alarming, appalling&rdquo;, told congressional lawmakers that: &ldquo;I thought these folks should know that this stuff is classified, that it was alarming what they were talking about, especially some of the most highly classified stuff.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Baker said that he &ldquo;argued with others about why they thought she shouldn&rsquo;t be charged.&rdquo; However, Baker said he was eventually persuaded by other senior FBI personnel, including Director Comey, &ldquo;that charging her was not appropriate because we could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that &mdash; we, the government, could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she had the intent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>FBI Used Gross Negligence Statute to Obtain Search Warrant</strong></p>\n<p>Interestingly, despite DOJ unwillingness to pursue the gross negligence statute, the FBI utilized it while obtaining a search warrant in the Clinton email case:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: You don&rsquo;t remember whether there were search warrants obtained in the case, other than the Weiner laptop?</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Priestap</strong>: There certainly could have been, but I don&rsquo;t remember.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: I can stipulate that we have seen drafts of search warrants submitted to the Eastern District of Virginia to obtain material in the Hillary Clinton case.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Priestap</strong>: Okay.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: Based on those search warrants, the predication in the search warrants were listed the statute of <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793\">18 U.S.C. 793(f)</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Anderson also was questioned regarding the search warrant and appeared to struggle when asked why the FBI was requesting search warrants based on &ldquo;a particular statute that has real potential legal problems, according to the DOJ analysis.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In this particular case, had we had evidence of intent, it&rsquo;s theoretically possible that we could have brought a prosecution, might have brought a prosecution under that statute. I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s, you know, what would have happened necessarily, but the statute is not &mdash; it is not the Department&rsquo;s view, as I understand it, the statute is invalid for constitutional reasons in every circumstance,&rdquo; Anderson said.</p>\n<p><strong>Congress Makes the Laws</strong></p>\n<p>Page, Baker, and Anderson all testified that the gross negligence statute was rarely, if ever used, as part of their explanation for the DOJ&rsquo;s unwillingness to pursue, but this logic was repeatedly challenged by then-majority House counsel Breitenbach:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If part of that rationale was that it had never been used, then, by extension, one might presume that other statutes that are on the books, if they aren&rsquo;t being used, should not be ever considered as predication for a prosecution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Breitenbach was providing a less-than subtle reminder that it is Congress, not the DOJ or the FBI, who create the laws. The DOJ, as part of the Executive Branch, has an obligation to enforce the statutes put in place by Congress, not to pass legal judgement on them.</p>\n<p>Anderson had no material response to this rebuttal, only noting &ldquo;that was not the intent of my statement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>FBI Ignored both Volume and Sensitivity of Clinton&rsquo;s Email Violations</strong></p>\n<p>Included within Clinton&rsquo;s emails was &ldquo;classified information up to the Special Access Program level.&rdquo; SAPs, as they are known, are <a href=\"https://news.clearancejobs.com/2013/04/04/an-elite-club-the-special-access-program/\">established</a> to &ldquo;control access, distribution, and provide protection for sensitive classified information beyond that normally required&rdquo; on a need-to-know basis with only a small number of individuals cleared to view the information.</p>\n<p>The classification level of SAPs is so high that Anderson actually refused to define her understanding of an SAP in the unclassified interview setting before congressional investigators, which led to an obvious question: In addition to considering the frequency of violation, would not the sensitivity of the emails also be a factor? Anderson&rsquo;s answer was eye-opening:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: [I] proposed that frequency of emails could be considered an element of the offense. And now what I&rsquo;m proposing is, and I&rsquo;m asking you, could the sensitivity of emails also be considered an element of an offense when considering intent, or even gross negligence?</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Ms. Anderson</strong>: I don&rsquo;t know. In this particular circumstance, our &mdash; the testimony of these witnesses was that they believed that there was &mdash; they did not believe the information to be classified. They believed themselves to be talking around the classified information and, therefore, not to actually be transmitting any classified information. So the facts that you&rsquo;re presenting were simply not present in this particular case.</em></p>\n<p>In other words, under Anderson&rsquo;s understanding of the DOJ&rsquo;s standard, the extreme volume of emails was not a factor, nor was the classification level of the emails, as long as those being investigated were able to say they simply didn&rsquo;t know any documents were actually classified&mdash;even if the primary subject of the investigation, the Secretary of State, should have been qualified to discern between classified and unclassified information.</p>\n<p><strong>FBI Never Looked for Evidence of Negligence</strong></p>\n<p>Anderson was asked about her understanding of the difference between gross negligence and extreme carelessness. Anderson answered that she didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;know exactly what the precise difference is between extremely careless and gross negligence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In her testimony, she was forced to admit that the team working on the case should have tried to better understand the difference between the two:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously, the use of the phrase &ldquo;extremely careless&rdquo; has been open to interpretation and confusion after the fact. So, perhaps, that issue is something we should have more carefully considered, we as a group. I&rsquo;m not saying, you know, there was anything that I did incorrectly here, but &mdash; so I don&rsquo;t know that there is a single meaning of extremely careless.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Which begs the question of why Anderson, among others, felt compelled to push Comey to change the language within his statement from the legal term of gross negligence to the non-legal term of extremely careless.</p>\n<p>Anderson, who told congressional investigators that the extremely careless phrase had been subject to competing interpretations, was quickly countered by Breitenbach, who noted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s competing, because it has no legal effect, whereas gross negligence does.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think you would agree with me that negligence is different than intent,&rdquo; Breitenbach told Anderson.</p>\n<p>But according to Anderson&rsquo;s testimony, the FBI never even looked into negligence due to the DOJ&rsquo;s legal position:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mr. Breitenbach</strong>: So there was no review as to whether there was negligence in this case?</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Ms. Anderson</strong>: It was legally irrelevant because the Department of Justice would not have brought a prosecution in a circumstance in which there was simply negligence.</em></p>\n<p>The issue at the heart of the Clinton email investigation was summarized by Breitenbach, who said that &ldquo;the Department of Justice made a decision that intent was required, even though we have a statute on the books that does not require intent that [only] requires gross negligence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gross negligence is different than willfulness and intentional conduct. But with the decision to require evidence of intent on the part of Clinton in order to prosecute, the DOJ managed to circumvent and in effect neutralize the entire FBI investigation from the outset.</p>\n<p>This could have been why Comey and the hierarchy of the FBI felt comfortable in drawing up an exoneration statement in advance of Clinton&rsquo;s actual interview. No actual evidence of intent, such as an email where Clinton overtly admitted she established her knowingly unsecure server for the purpose of sending classified information for convenience, had been found. Clinton was almost certain not to admit to this during her own FBI interview.</p>\n<p>Absent a slip-up on her part, Clinton was effectively in the clear from the outset of the FBI investigation due to the DOJ&rsquo;s decision to require intent.</p>\n<p><strong>DOJ&rsquo;s National Security Division Required Evidence of Intent</strong></p>\n<p>It was Page that testified as to whom was responsible for the decision within the DOJ to require intent as part of a gross negligence charge&mdash;Richard Scott and, secondarily, David Laufman.</p>\n<p>Scott, the deputy chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) of the Justice Department&rsquo;s National Security Division (NSD), was involved in the investigation into Clinton&rsquo;s private email server and reported to Laufman.</p>\n<p>Laufman, chief of CES and Scott&rsquo;s direct supervisor, was cited by Page as the individual responsible for altering the FBI&rsquo;s normal policy of interviews by insisting on being personally present for the interviews of &ldquo;not just Mrs. Clinton but also Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, and her sort of core team.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Both men were overseen by George Toscas, who was selected by the DOJ&rsquo;s head of the NSD, John Carlin, to oversee the entirety of the Clinton investigation from the DOJ&rsquo;s perspective. Working alongside Toscas was Stu Evans and Adam Hickey&mdash;both deputy assistant attorney generals like Toscas. According to Toscas, Evans, as the DOJ&rsquo;s point person on the FISA application on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, was responsible for managing&mdash;and reading&mdash;not only the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, but also the three subsequent renewals.</p>\n<p>Notably, with the exceptions of Moffa, Evans, and Hickey, every individual from the FBI and DOJ mentioned has either been fired or has resigned. Most have been the subject of congressional interviews.</p>",

                "text": "The Department of Justice, under then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, blocked the FBI from pursuing criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.\nThe DOJ decided early on in the Clinton email investigation to set an unusually high threshold for the prosecution of Clinton, ensuring from the outset that she would never be charged.\nTheepochtimes.com reports: In order for Clinton to be prosecuted, the DOJ required the FBI to establish evidence of intent\u2014even though the gross negligence statute explicitly does not require this.\nThis meant that the FBI would have needed to find a smoking gun, such as an email or an admission made during FBI questioning, revealing Clinton or her aides knowingly set up the private email server to send classified information.\nHillary Clinton was famously exonerated by FBI Director James Comey in a July 5, 2016, press conference, which immediately became the subject of controversy.\nAds by Revcontent\nNotably, Comey had been convinced to remove the term \u201cgross negligence\u201d to describe Clinton\u2019s actions from his prepared statement by, among others, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, FBI agent Peter Strzok, senior legal counsel Trisha Anderson, and FBI analyst Jonathan Moffa.\nBecause of Comey\u2019s statement, many have mistakenly concluded that the FBI acted independently from DOJ influence in their investigation of Clinton. Congressional testimonies by high ranking FBI officials involved in the investigation reveal, however, that this was not the case.\nThe testimonies, which were conducted last year behind closed-doors, have not been publicly released, but were reviewed for this article.\nDOJ Involvement in Clinton Case & Requirement of Intent\nLisa Page, an FBI lawyer who served as special counsel to Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe during the time of the Clinton investigation, noted during her testimony in July 2018, that the DOJ was intimately involved in the investigation.\n\u201cEverybody talks about this as if this was the FBI investigation, and the truth of the matter is there was not a single step, other than the July 5th statement, there was not a single investigative step that we did not do in consultation with or at the direction of the Justice Department,\u201d Page told congressional investigators on July 13, 2018.\nComey had also hinted at the influence exerted by the DOJ over the Clinton investigation in his July recommendation, stating that \u201cthere are obvious considerations, like the strength of the evidence, especially regarding intent.\u201d\nIntent is a requirement of several statutes the FBI was looking into. But intent is specifically not a factor under the charge of gross negligence\u2014contained within 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793(f)\u2014a fact that was brought up by Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) during Page\u2019s testimony:\nRep. Ratcliffe: Okay. And that\u2019s \u2014 I think, when you talk about intent, that\u2019s certainly true under part of 18 793(f), but it sounds like you all just blew over gross negligence.\nMs. Page: We did not blow over gross negligence. We, in fact \u2014 and, in fact, the Director \u2014 because on its face, it did seem like, well, maybe there\u2019s a potential here for this to be the charge. And we had multiple conversations, multiple conversations with the Justice Department about charging gross negligence.\nPage made clear during her testimony that the DOJ had decided that due to \u201cconstitutional vagueness\u201d a charge of gross negligence would not be supported without accompanying proof of intent\u2014a seemingly oxymoronic position:\nRep. Ratcliffe: Okay. So let me if I can, I know I\u2019m testing your memory, but when you say advice you got from the Department, you\u2019re making it sound like it was the Department that told you: You\u2019re not going to charge gross negligence because we\u2019re the prosecutors and we\u2019re telling you we\u2019re not going to \u2014\nMs. Page: That is correct.\nRep. Ratcliffe: \u2014 bring a case based on that.\nTrouble Defining Intent\nThe word \u201cintent\u201d drove the entirety of the FBI\u2019s investigation into the Clinton email server.\nIt appears, however, that there were differing understandings of the word \u201cintent\u201d within the FBI. Trisha Anderson, the No. 2 lawyer at the FBI, told investigators that what she viewed as intent was \u201can email that the Secretary sent saying, I set up this server for the purpose of sending unclassified information for my convenience, even though I know it\u2019s not a secure system.\u201d\nPage viewed the situation somewhat differently, agreeing they were looking for \u201can intent to do an act which is in violation of the law\u2019s central command.\u201d As she told investigators, the FBI \u201ccouldn\u2019t find any indicia of knowledge that she knew that these [classified emails] shouldn\u2019t be traversing her server.\u201d\nIn Anderson\u2019s understanding, she was looking for a prosecutable reason behind the establishment of the server itself. Page, however, was looking at whether Clinton knew which emails should not have traveled through the private server.\nMeanwhile, Bill Priestap, head of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division and who was officially in charge of the Clinton investigation, said during testimony that he thought the \u201cnumber of instances is absolutely a proper consideration\u201d in establishing intent.\nAccording to Ryan Breitenbach, who was the House Majority Counsel at the time of Priestap\u2019s interview, the State Department had identified 22 top-secret emails and 1,300 classified emails on Clinton\u2019s email server. As Breitenbach noted to Priestap during testimony, \u201cI think there might be many who would question whether people in this room would still be in this room if we had hit 1,300 emails on our personal Gmail service.\u201d\n\u2018DOJ Not Willing to Charge This\u2019\nPriestap was shown an email sent from an unknown individual in the FBI general counsel\u2019s office to Priestap\u2019s former boss, Michael Steinbach, which contained a chart of \u201cavailable statutes for prosecuting the former Secretary of State.\u201d Gross Negligence was specifically excluded from the chargeable statutes available to the FBI. Priestap, who had not previously seen the document, expressed concerns that this might have hindered the work of FBI investigators.\nMr. Breitenbach: We see in this chart that DOJ is not willing to charge this, meaning 18 U.S.C. 793(f). My question is going back to those draft affidavits. If DOJ is not willing to charge this statute, why would the FBI in an affidavit use this statute as predication to obtain a search warrant if this statute is never going to be prosecuted?\nMr. Priestap: So I \u2014 I don\u2019t know who put this together and used this language.\nMr. Breitenbach: Well, someone in the FBI general counsel\u2019s office.\nMr. Priestap: Yeah. No. No. I trust you. But I don\u2019t know why they, again, put it together. I don\u2019t know why they used this language, \u2018DOJ not willing to charge this.\u2019\nMy attitude is that if there is a Federal criminal statute still on the books, then, you know \u2014 and we think there may or might be a violation of that, we still have to work to uncover whether, in fact, there was.\nThe prosecutive history of a particular statute isn\u2019t going to affect \u2014 I sure hope it does not affect the fact-finder\u2019s work.\nPriestap said that it was his understanding that the gross negligence standard had not been met\u2014as opposed to not pursued\u2014in the Clinton case. As Priestap noted, \u201cif I understood from the department that they would never charge a particular statute, I would want to know that before I\u2019m going to dedicate resources to a particular topic. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d\nBut Lisa Page, a lawyer by training, seemed to have a very different understanding of what would be allowed by the DOJ. Page appeared to indicate during her testimony that because of the DOJ\u2019s position, there was no reason for the FBI to even pursue evidence related to the specific statute of gross negligence.\n\u201cLet\u2019s assume things are going swimmingly and, in fact, all 17 of those witnesses admit, \u2018We did it, it was on purpose, we totally wanted to mishandle classified information,\u2019 gross negligence would still have been off the table because of the department\u2019s assessment that it was vague. We would have other crimes to now charge, but gross negligence would not have been among them.\u201d Page said in her testimony.\nFBI General Counsel James Baker, who called Clinton\u2019s behavior \u201calarming, appalling\u201d, told congressional lawmakers that: \u201cI thought these folks should know that this stuff is classified, that it was alarming what they were talking about, especially some of the most highly classified stuff.\u201d\nBaker said that he \u201cargued with others about why they thought she shouldn\u2019t be charged.\u201d However, Baker said he was eventually persuaded by other senior FBI personnel, including Director Comey, \u201cthat charging her was not appropriate because we could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2014 we, the government, could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she had the intent.\u201d\nFBI Used Gross Negligence Statute to Obtain Search Warrant\nInterestingly, despite DOJ unwillingness to pursue the gross negligence statute, the FBI utilized it while obtaining a search warrant in the Clinton email case:\nMr. Breitenbach: You don\u2019t remember whether there were search warrants obtained in the case, other than the Weiner laptop?\nMr. Priestap: There certainly could have been, but I don\u2019t remember.\nMr. Breitenbach: I can stipulate that we have seen drafts of search warrants submitted to the Eastern District of Virginia to obtain material in the Hillary Clinton case.\nMr. Priestap: Okay.\nMr. Breitenbach: Based on those search warrants, the predication in the search warrants were listed the statute of 18 U.S.C. 793(f).\nAnderson also was questioned regarding the search warrant and appeared to struggle when asked why the FBI was requesting search warrants based on \u201ca particular statute that has real potential legal problems, according to the DOJ analysis.\u201d\n\u201cIn this particular case, had we had evidence of intent, it\u2019s theoretically possible that we could have brought a prosecution, might have brought a prosecution under that statute. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s, you know, what would have happened necessarily, but the statute is not \u2014 it is not the Department\u2019s view, as I understand it, the statute is invalid for constitutional reasons in every circumstance,\u201d Anderson said.\nCongress Makes the Laws\nPage, Baker, and Anderson all testified that the gross negligence statute was rarely, if ever used, as part of their explanation for the DOJ\u2019s unwillingness to pursue, but this logic was repeatedly challenged by then-majority House counsel Breitenbach:\n\u201cIf part of that rationale was that it had never been used, then, by extension, one might presume that other statutes that are on the books, if they aren\u2019t being used, should not be ever considered as predication for a prosecution.\u201d\nBreitenbach was providing a less-than subtle reminder that it is Congress, not the DOJ or the FBI, who create the laws. The DOJ, as part of the Executive Branch, has an obligation to enforce the statutes put in place by Congress, not to pass legal judgement on them.\nAnderson had no material response to this rebuttal, only noting \u201cthat was not the intent of my statement.\u201d\nFBI Ignored both Volume and Sensitivity of Clinton\u2019s Email Violations\nIncluded within Clinton\u2019s emails was \u201cclassified information up to the Special Access Program level.\u201d SAPs, as they are known, are established to \u201ccontrol access, distribution, and provide protection for sensitive classified information beyond that normally required\u201d on a need-to-know basis with only a small number of individuals cleared to view the information.\nThe classification level of SAPs is so high that Anderson actually refused to define her understanding of an SAP in the unclassified interview setting before congressional investigators, which led to an obvious question: In addition to considering the frequency of violation, would not the sensitivity of the emails also be a factor? Anderson\u2019s answer was eye-opening:\nMr. Breitenbach: [I] proposed that frequency of emails could be considered an element of the offense. And now what I\u2019m proposing is, and I\u2019m asking you, could the sensitivity of emails also be considered an element of an offense when considering intent, or even gross negligence?\nMs. Anderson: I don\u2019t know. In this particular circumstance, our \u2014 the testimony of these witnesses was that they believed that there was \u2014 they did not believe the information to be classified. They believed themselves to be talking around the classified information and, therefore, not to actually be transmitting any classified information. So the facts that you\u2019re presenting were simply not present in this particular case.\nIn other words, under Anderson\u2019s understanding of the DOJ\u2019s standard, the extreme volume of emails was not a factor, nor was the classification level of the emails, as long as those being investigated were able to say they simply didn\u2019t know any documents were actually classified\u2014even if the primary subject of the investigation, the Secretary of State, should have been qualified to discern between classified and unclassified information.\nFBI Never Looked for Evidence of Negligence\nAnderson was asked about her understanding of the difference between gross negligence and extreme carelessness. Anderson answered that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow exactly what the precise difference is between extremely careless and gross negligence.\u201d\nIn her testimony, she was forced to admit that the team working on the case should have tried to better understand the difference between the two:\n\u201cObviously, the use of the phrase \u201cextremely careless\u201d has been open to interpretation and confusion after the fact. So, perhaps, that issue is something we should have more carefully considered, we as a group. I\u2019m not saying, you know, there was anything that I did incorrectly here, but \u2014 so I don\u2019t know that there is a single meaning of extremely careless.\u201d\nWhich begs the question of why Anderson, among others, felt compelled to push Comey to change the language within his statement from the legal term of gross negligence to the non-legal term of extremely careless.\nAnderson, who told congressional investigators that the extremely careless phrase had been subject to competing interpretations, was quickly countered by Breitenbach, who noted, \u201cIt\u2019s competing, because it has no legal effect, whereas gross negligence does.\u201d\n\u201cI think you would agree with me that negligence is different than intent,\u201d Breitenbach told Anderson.\nBut according to Anderson\u2019s testimony, the FBI never even looked into negligence due to the DOJ\u2019s legal position:\nMr. Breitenbach: So there was no review as to whether there was negligence in this case?\nMs. Anderson: It was legally irrelevant because the Department of Justice would not have brought a prosecution in a circumstance in which there was simply negligence.\nThe issue at the heart of the Clinton email investigation was summarized by Breitenbach, who said that \u201cthe Department of Justice made a decision that intent was required, even though we have a statute on the books that does not require intent that [only] requires gross negligence.\u201d\nGross negligence is different than willfulness and intentional conduct. But with the decision to require evidence of intent on the part of Clinton in order to prosecute, the DOJ managed to circumvent and in effect neutralize the entire FBI investigation from the outset.\nThis could have been why Comey and the hierarchy of the FBI felt comfortable in drawing up an exoneration statement in advance of Clinton\u2019s actual interview. No actual evidence of intent, such as an email where Clinton overtly admitted she established her knowingly unsecure server for the purpose of sending classified information for convenience, had been found. Clinton was almost certain not to admit to this during her own FBI interview.\nAbsent a slip-up on her part, Clinton was effectively in the clear from the outset of the FBI investigation due to the DOJ\u2019s decision to require intent.\nDOJ\u2019s National Security Division Required Evidence of Intent\nIt was Page that testified as to whom was responsible for the decision within the DOJ to require intent as part of a gross negligence charge\u2014Richard Scott and, secondarily, David Laufman.\nScott, the deputy chief of the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section (CES) of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division (NSD), was involved in the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email server and reported to Laufman.\nLaufman, chief of CES and Scott\u2019s direct supervisor, was cited by Page as the individual responsible for altering the FBI\u2019s normal policy of interviews by insisting on being personally present for the interviews of \u201cnot just Mrs. Clinton but also Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, and her sort of core team.\u201d\nBoth men were overseen by George Toscas, who was selected by the DOJ\u2019s head of the NSD, John Carlin, to oversee the entirety of the Clinton investigation from the DOJ\u2019s perspective. Working alongside Toscas was Stu Evans and Adam Hickey\u2014both deputy assistant attorney generals like Toscas. According to Toscas, Evans, as the DOJ\u2019s point person on the FISA application on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, was responsible for managing\u2014and reading\u2014not only the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application on Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, but also the three subsequent renewals.\nNotably, with the exceptions of Moffa, Evans, and Hickey, every individual from the FBI and DOJ mentioned has either been fired or has resigned. Most have been the subject of congressional interviews.",

Rashida Tlaib\nTraslation: Guilty or not, we hate Trump so we will impeach him in the House.\n\u2014 Deep State Exposed\u00ae (@DeepStateExpose) January 5, 2019\nThegatewaypundit.com reports: Here is the wording to the latest pledge to impeach cuz Trump has mean tweets.\nCongress is tasked with defending the Constitution, representing the best interests of the American people, and checking or removing Presidents who undermine democracy.\nWe the people are calling on members of Congress to do their jobs.\nEvery day brings new allegations that Trump has broken the law or violated the Constitution. If we don\u2019t check his power and remove him from office, this will become the new normal.\nCongress can\u2019t let Trump get away with taking bribes, manipulating our election, trampling on our rights, or intimidating and attacking opponents. In a real democracy, no one is above the law \u2014 including the President. This isn\u2019t a partisan issue, it\u2019s a public safety one.\nPlease sign the petition to Congress now and join us in building a movement to impeach Trump!",

His lawyer told the court he does not accept those verdicts.</p>\n<p>In her victim impact statement, the girl said the family were experiencing financial and other implications from the man no longer being in the home. She said she sometimes felt these were her fault.</p>\n<p>She said she now suffers self esteem, worry and stress issues. She was unable to sleep and her school work suffered.</p>\n<p>Ads by Revcontent</p>\n<p>She said she had broken down when she heard the verdict. &ldquo;I sometimes feel as if I am at the bottom of the ocean,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with no light at all.&rdquo; She does not want to see the man again, the court heard.</p>\n<p>Last January, the man pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to three counts of defilement of a child under the age of 17 years old on dates between March and June 2017.</p>\n<p>He had pleaded not guilty one count of oral rape, 12 counts of rape and three counts of defilement of the same girl on dates between 2011 and 2017. He also denied a further count of sexual exploitation of the girl in July 2017.</p>\n<p>The jury convicted him of all these charges in January. The victim was aged between 11 and almost 16 years old at the time of the offences.</p>\n<p>Mr Justice Michael White said the offences had been a &ldquo;serious violation of a child&rdquo; which involved a very serious breach of trust as the man had been in a position of authority. He also noted the length of time the offences continued and the severity of the abuse.</p>\n<p>He took into account that the man was an Irish citizen of foreign extraction with very little English and prison would be more difficult as a result. He also noted the man had no previous convictions and had been a good provider.</p>\n<p>The judge said he was particularly disturbed by the fact that the &ldquo;intolerable&rdquo; abuse was happening &ldquo;as a matter of rote.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you think of the nature of the offences, it does not bear thinking about,&rdquo; said Mr Justice White. The judge imposed concurrent sentences totalling 12 years.</p>\n<p>A local garda told Vincent Heneghan SC, prosecuting, that the abuse began with oral rape when the victim was 11 years old and the man later began having sex with her &ldquo;on a highly regular basis&rdquo; in the family home while the child&rsquo;s mother was away working.</p>\n<p>The sexual abuse continued until June 2017 when she was 15 years old. After making a disclosure to members of her family she made a complaint to garda&iacute; in July 2017.</p>\n<p>The count of sexual exploitation refers to a phone call between the victim and the man, which was heard on loudspeaker by family members in July 2017. The accused invited the child to have sex with him for &euro;200.</p>\n<p>The court heard the man effectively controlled the victim during the time of the offences in a domestic situation where he was a position of authority.</p>\n<p>Damien Colgan SC, defending, said his client accepted what he did was wrong and stands over his guilty pleas in relation to three charges of defilement. He said the man does not accept the jury verdicts on the other counts.</p>\n<p>He said the man had no previous convictions, a good work history and had abided by all his bail conditions. He asked the court to take into account that the man would be serving his sentence as a foreign national in an Irish prison.</p>",

He also noted the man had no previous convictions and had been a good provider.\nThe judge said he was particularly disturbed by the fact that the \u201cintolerable\u201d abuse was happening \u201cas a matter of rote.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you think of the nature of the offences, it does not bear thinking about,\u201d said Mr Justice White. The judge imposed concurrent sentences totalling 12 years.\nA local garda told Vincent Heneghan SC, prosecuting, that the abuse began with oral rape when the victim was 11 years old and the man later began having sex with her \u201con a highly regular basis\u201d in the family home while the child\u2019s mother was away working.\nThe sexual abuse continued until June 2017 when she was 15 years old. After making a disclosure to members of her family she made a complaint to garda\u00ed in July 2017.\nThe count of sexual exploitation refers to a phone call between the victim and the man, which was heard on loudspeaker by family members in July 2017. The accused invited the child to have sex with him for \u20ac200.\nThe court heard the man effectively controlled the victim during the time of the offences in a domestic situation where he was a position of authority.\nDamien Colgan SC, defending, said his client accepted what he did was wrong and stands over his guilty pleas in relation to three charges of defilement. He said the man does not accept the jury verdicts on the other counts.\nHe said the man had no previous convictions, a good work history and had abided by all his bail conditions. He asked the court to take into account that the man would be serving his sentence as a foreign national in an Irish prison.",

Ecuador says the Isaias family cost the impoverished country a total of $661.5 million.\nThe Isaias family began dumping large amounts of campaign contributions into American political campaigns, including $90,000 to Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign.\nCareer criminals protected by Hillary Clinton\nAs a result, after reaching out to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for asylum, the Isaias\u2019 were granted expedited immigration into the U.S. Clinton\u2019s State Department then rebuffed attempts by Ecuador to extradite them to face justice.\nOnce in America, the Isaias family owned and operated DaVinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, companies that contracted exclusively with Planned Parenthood of Orange County to receive aborted baby tissues and organs, which they trafficked overseas.\nRoberto and William Isaias\u2019 nephew, Estafano Isaias, Jr., who was involved in profit-taking from the two biotech companies, also owned a business that sold pornography online.\nAfter the release of the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 undercover video expos\u00e9s in 2015, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas sued the companies for their illegal body parts trade, and in 2017 reached a settlement agreement that fined them $7.8 million, and ordered their businesses to close.\n\u201cWe have mentioned the Isaias brothers repeatedly in articles that we have published over the past couple of years, including the corruption in the Obama Administration, which allowed them to come to our country where they committed further crimes,\u201d said Newman. \u201cWe hoped that someone would take notice.\u201d\nJust last month, Operation Rescue published an expos\u00e9 that delved into the market for aborted baby body parts. It revealed that the DaVinci biotech companies sent tissues and organs obtained from Planned Parenthood around the world to businesses that were working to develop anti-aging drugs for the wealthy.\n\u201cThe Isaias\u2019 are bad people, and we are very relieved that they will soon be back in Ecuador to serve their sentences and hopefully return the money they took from the people they bilked,\u201d said Newman. \u201cAnd we are especially glad that they are out of the baby parts trade permanently.\u201d",

She&rsquo;s 17 now but says she first became a child bride at 14.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At the time I was a virgin. It was going to be my first marriage of course,&rdquo; said the teen.</p>\n<p>She says it didn&rsquo;t last. And in 2016, she says she was married off to Rajmann Sanders, a man more than twice her age who then allegedly began sexually assaulting her and her 10-year-old sister.</p>\n<p>Ads by Revcontent</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The 10-year-old was not handled correctly and everything was swept under the rug. Not only was it wrong, it was wrong to me because at the time I was still his wife,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Sanders is charged with more than a dozen sexual offenses against the girls, including rape, indecent assault, and forcible compulsion. The criminal complaint reveals Sanders threatened to shoot the older victim during one sexual assault.</p>\n<p>Police are now investigating whether child weddings are being conducted at the Masjid Uthman Dan Fodiyo mosque on the 4800 block of Paschall.</p>\n<p>One of the victims says her unofficial marriage took place there.</p>\n<p>Last Friday, police conducted search warrants at the mosque and the home of a mosque leader.</p>\n<p>The alleged victim says she&rsquo;s coming forward to warn others.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is not healthy for me or my kids. No one should want their kids around this, especially with the pedophilia, that should be enough to say no I don&rsquo;t want my kids around this,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The victims are now in the protective custody of the Department Human Services. Sanders remains behind bars. Attempts to reach his public defender have been unsuccessful. The investigation is ongoing.</p>",

She\u2019s 17 now but says she first became a child bride at 14.\n\u201cAt the time I was a virgin. It was going to be my first marriage of course,\u201d said the teen.\nShe says it didn\u2019t last. And in 2016, she says she was married off to Rajmann Sanders, a man more than twice her age who then allegedly began sexually assaulting her and her 10-year-old sister.\nAds by Revcontent\n\u201cThe 10-year-old was not handled correctly and everything was swept under the rug. Not only was it wrong, it was wrong to me because at the time I was still his wife,\u201d she said.\nSanders is charged with more than a dozen sexual offenses against the girls, including rape, indecent assault, and forcible compulsion. The criminal complaint reveals Sanders threatened to shoot the older victim during one sexual assault.\nPolice are now investigating whether child weddings are being conducted at the Masjid Uthman Dan Fodiyo mosque on the 4800 block of Paschall.\nOne of the victims says her unofficial marriage took place there.\nLast Friday, police conducted search warrants at the mosque and the home of a mosque leader.\nThe alleged victim says she\u2019s coming forward to warn others.\n\u201cThis is not healthy for me or my kids. No one should want their kids around this, especially with the pedophilia, that should be enough to say no I don\u2019t want my kids around this,\u201d she said.\nThe victims are now in the protective custody of the Department Human Services. Sanders remains behind bars. Attempts to reach his public defender have been unsuccessful. The investigation is ongoing.",

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>f you want to make a joke about Devin Nunes&rsquo; new lawsuit against Twitter (and some Twitter users) where else would you make those jokes, except on the social platform itself? The California Republican must have known when he filed this lawsuit that it would backfire and actually result in a lot more criticism of the Congressman. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/19/ridiculousness-devin-nunes-suing-devin-nunes-cow-what-it-really-signals/?utm_term=.a3e3c49cc1d0\">The Washington Post writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Nunes is suing @DevinCow, along with another parody account called @DevinNunesMom, Republican strategist Liz Mair and Twitter as an organization, alleging a </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/19/this-was-an-orchestrated-effort-devin-nunes-sues-twitter-individual-accounts-defamation/?utm_term=.8eaaea41d303\"><em>concerted effort to defame him and work against his 2018 reelection campaign</em></a><em>. He&rsquo;s also accusing Twitter of unfairly targeting conservatives through a practice known as &ldquo;</em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/five-myths/five-myths-about-twitter/2018/08/23/74073e16-a640-11e8-a656-943eefab5daf_story.html?utm_term=.d70741616f92\"><em>shadow banning</em></a><em>.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s asking for $250 million.</em></p><p><em>What might be most notable about Nunes&rsquo;s suit is that this is the first battle he chose. Nunes said on Sean Hannity&rsquo;s Fox News show Monday night that this is &ldquo;the first of many&rdquo; lawsuits to come. Does he really think his most obvious and airtight case involved &hellip; @DevinCow and @DevinNunesMom?</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Not surprising it looks like Nunes may not have had access to the cream of the crop when it comes to attorneys who would take this lawsuit.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the lawsuit does have one big fan. And if you want to draw even more attention to the Twitter accounts in question, there is no better supporter than the President himself. Donald Trump and Devin Nunes always seem to have each other&rsquo;s backs.</p>\n<p>While the @DevinNunesMom account has been suspended, the @DevinCow account has gone from 1000 to 135,000 followers in just one day (and it&rsquo;s still growing). The lawsuit also reportedly sparked countless other Nunes parody accounts.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some reaction from the Twittersphere.</p>\n<p>As for @DevinCow, whomever is behind that account isn&rsquo;t backing down.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://lockerdome.com/lad/11037904822832998?pubid=ld-4512-3586&pubo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsandguts.com&rid=&width=640\"></iframe></figure>",

The California Republican must have known when he filed this lawsuit that it would backfire and actually result in a lot more criticism of the Congressman. The Washington Post writes:\nNunes is suing @DevinCow, along with another parody account called @DevinNunesMom, Republican strategist Liz Mair and Twitter as an organization, alleging a concerted effort to defame him and work against his 2018 reelection campaign. He\u2019s also accusing Twitter of unfairly targeting conservatives through a practice known as \u201cshadow banning.\u201d He\u2019s asking for $250 million.\nWhat might be most notable about Nunes\u2019s suit is that this is the first battle he chose. Nunes said on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show Monday night that this is \u201cthe first of many\u201d lawsuits to come. Does he really think his most obvious and airtight case involved \u2026 @DevinCow and @DevinNunesMom?\nNot surprising it looks like Nunes may not have had access to the cream of the crop when it comes to attorneys who would take this lawsuit.\nMeanwhile, the lawsuit does have one big fan. And if you want to draw even more attention to the Twitter accounts in question, there is no better supporter than the President himself. Donald Trump and Devin Nunes always seem to have each other\u2019s backs.\nWhile the @DevinNunesMom account has been suspended, the @DevinCow account has gone from 1000 to 135,000 followers in just one day (and it\u2019s still growing). The lawsuit also reportedly sparked countless other Nunes parody accounts.\nHere\u2019s some reaction from the Twittersphere.\nAs for @DevinCow, whomever is behind that account isn\u2019t backing down.",

From The New York Times:\n\u201cHouse Republican leaders kept defections low after feverishly working to assuage concerns among rank-and-file members about protecting congressional powers and about the precedent that Mr. Trump could be setting for Democratic presidents to use national emergencies for their own purposes. Ultimately, 13 Republicans defected from the party line to vote for the one-page resolution.\u201d\nThe question is will there be enough votes to overturn a certain presidential veto. The answer at the moment is probably not.",

And for those who say he isn&rsquo;t credible, Cohen has brought documents he says will back up many of his claims. Here are some of the more significant things he is expected to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;A lot of people have asked&hellip;whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. &hellip;Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;He told me black people would never vote for him because they are too stupid.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.&rdquo; </em></p><p><em>&ldquo;The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>&ldquo;Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Read the full statement below.</p>\n<figure><iframe data-secret=\"MIy8W1mey7\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5752909-2019-02-26.html?embed=true&responsive=false&sidebar=false\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://lockerdome.com/lad/11037904822832998?pubid=ld-4512-3586&pubo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsandguts.com&rid=&width=640\"></iframe></figure>",

And for those who say he isn\u2019t credible, Cohen has brought documents he says will back up many of his claims. Here are some of the more significant things he is expected to say:\n\u201cA lot of people have asked\u2026whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. \u2026Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails.\u201d\n\u201cHe told me black people would never vote for him because they are too stupid.\u201d\n\u201cHe asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did.\u201d\n\u201cThe President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie.\u201d\nRead the full statement below.",

And the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the electoral college.\u201d\nPolitico writes:\nProposals to eliminate the Electoral College have gained steam in the years since President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, when Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote by nearly three million votes but lost the Electoral College by a wide margin thanks to close defeats in a handful of key states.\nTrump\u2019s victory has given way to momentum for a national popular vote, but the Electoral College\u2019s enshrinement in the Constitution has prompted renewed interest in workarounds to spring up like the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, in which member states pledge their state\u2019s electoral college votes to the winner of the national popular vote.\nWatch Warren\u2019s response above.",

                "text": "President Donald Trump's budget is dead on arrival and, my conservatism notwithstanding, that is a good thing.\nU.S. economy is beset by negative structural forces beyond our borders. Growth is slowing, a recession is becoming a real risk, and the totality of the president's budget cuts is ill-advised. Instead, he should articulate an agenda that challenges the Congress to keep the recovery on track.\nChina's flagging economy won't be resurrected by any trade deal hatched by Presidents Trump and Xi. The communist leader has imposed more state controls that breed corruption and waste, and burden provincial governments and private businesses with a mountain of debt.\nRepeated injections of credit and fiscal stimulus won't solve that mess.\nEurope remains obsessed with preserving dysfunctional macroeconomic policies required to sustain a euro that promotes German exports but is overvalued for less dynamic southern European economies.\nItaly is slipping into recession, and growth elsewhere remains perilously close to zero. Brussels' obsession with punishing Britain for Brexit and Theresa May's unimaginative leadership leaves the island nation struggling.\nMore European Central Bank stimulus is like an opioid for a cancer patient. It relieves pain but will not reverse the inevitable-the ultimate collapse of the EU as a global force.\nNo surprise, U.S. imports are growing more rapidly than exports, and the trade deficit jumped 10% last year. That taxes U.S. growth, and armistices pausing Trump's trade wars won't significantly alter the reality that revving up U.S. growth requires boosting domestic demand and addressing skilled labor shortages.\nDemocratic senators running for president see all this and are promoting socialist solutions. Each has embraced the Green New Deal, which requires de facto government takeovers of the automotive, banking, health care, education and energy sectors and a Maoist iron rice bowl-a guaranteed basic income for all.\nAmericans are not that radical.\nDemocrats won the House with moderate candidates promising to work for practical solutions to improve health care and transportation and to reform immigration. The latter touches a cultural nerve in ways Washington's aging political class and Northeast liberals simply don't grasp.\nU.S. prescription drugs are rising at nearly double the rate of inflation-even after all the discounts to pharmacy-benefit-managers that the drug companies like to blame. The White House should challenge Congress with pre-drafted bills; for example, one that explicitly links U.S. drug prices to those charged in Germany.\nSimilarly, the administration should offer a bill ending Big Pharma's penchant for suing generic manufactures and forcing agreements that delay generics and limit competition. And perhaps investigate a few CEOs for outright price fixing.\nTrump's $1.5 trillion dollar infrastructure plan got little traction because it is full of questionable right-wing ideas-for example, private toll roads too often fail. And it didn't specify how the $200 billion federal contribution would be funded.\nAfter 25 years at 18.4 cents per gallon, it's time to raise the gas tax 25 cents and offer the proceeds to the states on a per capita basis to do as they please if they match with new money and spend what they receive within 12 months. Each dollar of tax collected, if spent immediately, would boost gross domestic product by the same amount and create good-paying middle-class jobs.\nTrump should de-emphasize the border wall. He doesn't have the votes in Congress and the courts will decide if his national emergency is legitimate.\nInstead, offer a grand deal on legal immigration-permanent status for DACAs if the Democrats will agree to reform family reunification rules and replace the visa lottery with a system that emphasizes badly needed STEM skills.\nTrump needs to move to the center on those issues with simple understandable proposals in ready drafted bills. Then challenge Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell to put those to up or down votes and hammer them relentlessly when they delay.\nThese are hard swallows for many in Congress but all would help lift wages right away and make Trump the pragmatist in the face of a do-nothing Congress that only bickers, investigates and complains.\nAll should be pitched as initiatives to improve the conditions for working Americans-the folks who will ultimately determine the occupant of the Oval Office in 2021.\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Who drove Amazon to walk away from a deal, that included over $2 billion in tax credits and zoning exemptions, to build a massive headquarters in Long Island City (LIC)? Progressive ideologues.</p>\n<p>Governor Cuomo got it right when he admitted during a radio interview on February 22, that &ldquo;progressives do not know how to govern.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Yes, <em>all</em> the New York progressives are guilty of that charge.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s review:</p>\n<p>Governor Cuomo, who calls himself a &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; progressive (a label his father, Mario, invented in 1982), made the first mistake: negotiating the pact in secret.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s classic Cuomo. He is a one-man band who trusts no one and doesn&rsquo;t like to be questioned.</p>\n<p>Cuomo&rsquo;s other mistake: he believed that if the City&rsquo;s progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed on, they could jam the Amazon deal through.</p>\n<p>As for Amazon&rsquo;s CEO, progressive Jeff Bezos, and his team that hammered out the deal: they were naive. A &quot;Firewall&quot; essay titled &ldquo;What can other companies learn from Amazon&rsquo;s N.Y.C.

                "text": "Who drove Amazon to walk away from a deal, that included over $2 billion in tax credits and zoning exemptions, to build a massive headquarters in Long Island City (LIC)? Progressive ideologues.\nGovernor Cuomo got it right when he admitted during a radio interview on February 22, that \u201cprogressives do not know how to govern.\u201d\nYes, all the New York progressives are guilty of that charge.\nLet\u2019s review:\nGovernor Cuomo, who calls himself a \u201cpragmatic\u201d progressive (a label his father, Mario, invented in 1982), made the first mistake: negotiating the pact in secret.\nThat\u2019s classic Cuomo. He is a one-man band who trusts no one and doesn\u2019t like to be questioned.\nCuomo\u2019s other mistake: he believed that if the City\u2019s progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, signed on, they could jam the Amazon deal through.\nAs for Amazon\u2019s CEO, progressive Jeff Bezos, and his team that hammered out the deal: they were naive. A \"Firewall\" essay titled \u201cWhat can other companies learn from Amazon\u2019s N.Y.C. Debacle?\u201d concluded, \u201cAmazon\u2019s mistake was taking Cuomo\u2019s word for it that everyone would be supportive rather than finding out for themselves.\u201d\nAlso, Cuomo, de Blasio, and Amazon underestimated the political sway of freshman progressive Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) who represents LIC.\nA flagrant violator of Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s political rule, \u201cyou are entitled to your own opinions but not your own facts,\u201d AOC made up some pretty ludicrous \u201cfacts.\u201d Amazon had to be stopped, she declared, because it\u2019s \u201cnot just about any jobs, it\u2019s about dignified jobs in New York.\u201d\nInsisting \u201csomeone\u2019s got to look out for the people our system is leaving behind,\u201d she wanted to \u201ceffectively organize against creeping overreach of one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations.\u201d\nLet\u2019s see; AOC thinks tens of thousands of new well-paying white-collar jobs and blue-collar construction jobs that would have been created in LIC are not \u201cdignified.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous.\nAnd what about the scores of local entrepreneurs \u2014 shopkeepers and restauranteurs \u2014 and the folks they employ that would have benefited financially from 25,000 new workers and residents who would have patronized those businesses? Shouldn\u2019t AOC be concerned that they \u201cbe looked out for\u201d?\nDespite AOC\u2019s vacuous statements, she did frighten State Senator Mike Gianaris whose district includes LIC.\nDreading a 2020 Democratic Primary challenge from one of AOC\u2019s confreres, Gianaris cast his lot with radical progressives and came out against Amazon.\nEven though polls indicated 80 percent of his constituents wanted Amazon in LIC, Gianaris not only deemed the deal \u201cunacceptable,\u201d his senate office sent out fliers that demanded Amazon \u201cstay in Seattle.\u201d\nTo further prove his loyalty to the new progressive order, Gianaris persuaded Senate Majority Leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, to nominate him to the Public Authorities Board where he would be empowered to scuttle the Amazon project.\nThe deal, however, would never get to that board because Amazon had had enough and scrapped their plan citing that too many local pols \u201cmade it clear that they oppose our presence.\u201d\nProgressives were jubilant all over the nation. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders praised New Yorkers \u201cfor standing up to the power of Amazon.\u201d\nThe clueless AOC, the Post reported, \u201cincorrectly stated that $3 billion in subsidies that would have gone to Amazon could be used to hire teachers, fix the subways and \u2018put a lot of people to work.\u2019\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t understand that there is no bag of money. The subsidies consisted mostly of future tax incentives.\nOpining on the Amazon disaster, Mayor de Blasio actually made a lucid observation: \u201cI came up watching the mistakes of progressives of the past, unfortunately what happened in this city when it almost went to bankruptcy in the 1970s. I saw all the times progressives did not show people effective governance and all the times progressives made the kinds of mistakes that alienated working people.\u201d\nFor once, the mayor gets it.

The legislation would revoke Trump's executive order declaring an emergency so he could use other federal funding to pay for his wall.</p>\n<p>With three Senate Republicans saying they will support the legislation, only one more was needed to vote with all the Democrats to pass the measure and send it to Trump.</p>\n<p>Trump is sure to prevail in the end since he could use his first-ever veto to kill the measure, but the White House is seeking to minimize defections among the president's GOP allies to avoid embarrassment.</p>\n<p>&quot;When you see the vote today there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto,&quot; said House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.</p>\n<p>Even many GOP lawmakers who view themselves as protectors of Congress' power of the purse say they are deferring to Trump in this case, saying he has the authority under a mid-1970s statute.</p>\n<p>&quot;They love Trump in my district,&quot; said Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo. &quot;I'm for Trump.&quot;</p>\n<p>Democratic leaders say the vote is not about the merits of Trump's wall but how Trump is trampling on the Constitution by grabbing money that he can't obtain through normal means.</p>\n<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump's action &quot;steals billions of dollars&quot; from the military construction projects&mdash; including possibly family housing and child care centers &mdash; to build the wall with Mexico.</p>\n<p>Republicans counter that problems with drug runners and human trafficking give merit to Trump's maneuver.</p>\n<p>&quot;I went down there neutral on this question. Didn't know whether or not I'd support a national emergency,&quot; said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who recently returned from a National Guard deployment along the border in Arizona. &quot;And I came back more convinced than probably anybody that this is the right thing to do.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;If Republicans vote their beliefs, we'll get a lot. If they vote their party, we won't get a lot,&quot; said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.</p>\n<p>Trump took to Twitter on Monday to urge Senate Republicans to stick with him.</p>\n<p>&quot;I hope our great Republican Senators don't get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,&quot; Trump wrote. &quot;Without strong Borders, we don't have a Country &mdash; and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, don't fall into the Democrats 'trap' of Open Borders and Crime!&quot;</p>\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence is expected to discuss the issue with GOP senators during their weekly private lunch. A Justice Department official is also expected to attend.</p>\n<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump is trying to &quot;bend the law&quot; with his declaration of a national emergency on the southern border. He called on lawmakers to &quot;speak up with one bipartisan voice&quot; to put a check on the executive branch as the founding founders envisioned.</p>\n<p>&quot;What would stop a future president from claiming an emergency every week?&quot; he asked.</p>\n<p>On Monday, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would vote to block the order, joining Maine's Susan Collins and Alaska's Lisa Murkowski as Republicans supporting the resolution. Congress must defend its power of the purse and warned that a future Democratic president might abuse the power to advance &quot;radical policies,&quot; Tillis said.</p>\n<p>Another Republican, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, called Trump's order &quot;unnecessary, unwise, and inconsistent with the United States Constitution and I'll decide how to vote when I'm presented with something to vote on.&quot;</p>\n<p>Senate voting on Trump's emergency order could drag under a rarely used procedure, which an aide said is possibly a first for the chamber. The law allows for up to 15 days of committee review&mdash; in this case, at the Armed Services panel &mdash; with a full Senate vote three days later. Senators, though, said the process could be expedited.</p>\n<p>At issue is Trump's longstanding vow to build a wall along the 1,900-mile southwest border, perhaps his top campaign promise. He has long since dropped any pretense that money for the wall would come from Mexico, which he once claimed would be the source of funding.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month Congress approved a huge spending bill providing nearly $1.4 billion to build 55 miles (89 kilometers) of border barriers in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, ending a dispute that had led to a record 35-day partial shutdown of the government. Trump had demanded $5.7 billion to construct more than 200 miles (322 kilometers).</p>\n<p>Trump's declaration of a national emergency gives him access to about $3.6 billion in funding for military construction projects to divert to border fencing. Lawmakers in both parties are recoiling at the politically toxic prospect of losing cherished projects at back-home military bases.

In addition, it is considering shifting more than $2 billion from Defense Department accounts into a Pentagon counter-drug fund to be tapped for wall construction.</p>\n<p>Trump's edict is also being challenged in the federal courts, where a host of Democratic-led states such as California are among those that have sued to overturn the order.

(Minoru Iwasaki/Kyodo News via AP)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Whatever emerges from the summit this week between President Donald Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, it is highly unlikely that the international spotlight on host nation Vietnam is going to change with it having one of the world&rsquo;s most abysmal records on human rights.</p>\n<p>A 2019 annual report, &ldquo;Human Rights Watch&rdquo; concludes that Vietnam&rsquo;s appalling human rights record actually &ldquo;worsened in 2018 as the government imprisoned dissidents for longer prison terms, sanctioned thugs to attack rights defenders, and passed draconian laws that further threaten freedom of expression.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In what could easily be an historical assessment of Russia under Stalin or a contemporaneous review of Kim&rsquo;s North Korea, the report points out that &ldquo;the Communist Party of Vietnam monopolizes power through the government, controls all major political and social organizations, and punishes people who dare to criticize or challenge its rule.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Human Rights Watch&rdquo; notes there is no independent media and the government &ldquo;controls TV, radio, newspapers, and other publications.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are no labor unions, or political organizations and, according to the report, &ldquo;police subject dissidents to lengthy and bullying interrogations, and detain them incommunicado for months without access to family members or legal counsel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>An independent judiciary is non-existent in Vietnam. The courts are, &ldquo;Human Rights Watch&rdquo; points out, &ldquo;Communist Party-controlled&rdquo; and &ldquo;receive instructions on how to rule in criminal cases.&rdquo; The same courts &ldquo;have issued increasingly harsh prison sentences for activists convicted on bogus national security charges.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As a recent example, &ldquo;Watch&rdquo; cites the trial last year of twelve people for &ldquo;conducting propaganda against the state.&rdquo; Sentences ranged from 4 to 12 years.</p>\n<p>Where bloggers have used the internet to advance freedom and challenge autocratic leaders in Egypt and Tunisia during the &ldquo;Arab Spring,&rdquo; they don&rsquo;t get a chance to start in Vietnam.</p>\n<p>Bloggers, &ldquo;Human Rights Watch&rdquo; points out, &ldquo;face frequent physical assaults by officials or government connected thugs, who are not punished for these attacks. In June and July of 2018 in Lam Dong province, unidentified men threw rocks and a handmade incendiary device into the house of a labor activist and former political prisoner, Do Thi Minh Hanh. In August, security agents brutally beat rights activists Pham Doan Trang, Nguyen Tin, and Nguyen Dang Cao Dai after a raid on a concert in Ho Chi Minh City.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Perhaps aware of the role the Internet has played in political upheaval elsewhere, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed a law which went into effect last month requiring service providers to take down offending material within 24 hours of receiving a request from the Minister of Public Security or the Ministry of Information and Communications.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Internet companies also are required to store data locally, verify user information, and disclose user data to authorities on demand without a court order,&rdquo; concludes &ldquo;Human Rights Watch,&rdquo; underscoring that all &ldquo;threaten the right to privacy and could facilitate further suppression of online dissent or activism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>John Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

                "text": "Whatever emerges from the summit this week between President Donald Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un, it is highly unlikely that the international spotlight on host nation Vietnam is going to change with it having one of the world\u2019s most abysmal records on human rights.\nA 2019 annual report, \u201cHuman Rights Watch\u201d concludes that Vietnam\u2019s appalling human rights record actually \u201cworsened in 2018 as the government imprisoned dissidents for longer prison terms, sanctioned thugs to attack rights defenders, and passed draconian laws that further threaten freedom of expression.\u201d\nIn what could easily be an historical assessment of Russia under Stalin or a contemporaneous review of Kim\u2019s North Korea, the report points out that \u201cthe Communist Party of Vietnam monopolizes power through the government, controls all major political and social organizations, and punishes people who dare to criticize or challenge its rule.\u201d\n\u201cHuman Rights Watch\u201d notes there is no independent media and the government \u201ccontrols TV, radio, newspapers, and other publications.\u201d\nThere are no labor unions, or political organizations and, according to the report, \u201cpolice subject dissidents to lengthy and bullying interrogations, and detain them incommunicado for months without access to family members or legal counsel.\u201d\nAn independent judiciary is non-existent in Vietnam. The courts are, \u201cHuman Rights Watch\u201d points out, \u201cCommunist Party-controlled\u201d and \u201creceive instructions on how to rule in criminal cases.\u201d The same courts \u201chave issued increasingly harsh prison sentences for activists convicted on bogus national security charges.\u201d\nAs a recent example, \u201cWatch\u201d cites the trial last year of twelve people for \u201cconducting propaganda against the state.\u201d Sentences ranged from 4 to 12 years.\nWhere bloggers have used the internet to advance freedom and challenge autocratic leaders in Egypt and Tunisia during the \u201cArab Spring,\u201d they don\u2019t get a chance to start in Vietnam.\nBloggers, \u201cHuman Rights Watch\u201d points out, \u201cface frequent physical assaults by officials or government connected thugs, who are not punished for these attacks. In June and July of 2018 in Lam Dong province, unidentified men threw rocks and a handmade incendiary device into the house of a labor activist and former political prisoner, Do Thi Minh Hanh. In August, security agents brutally beat rights activists Pham Doan Trang, Nguyen Tin, and Nguyen Dang Cao Dai after a raid on a concert in Ho Chi Minh City.\u201d\nPerhaps aware of the role the Internet has played in political upheaval elsewhere, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed a law which went into effect last month requiring service providers to take down offending material within 24 hours of receiving a request from the Minister of Public Security or the Ministry of Information and Communications.\n\u201cInternet companies also are required to store data locally, verify user information, and disclose user data to authorities on demand without a court order,\u201d concludes \u201cHuman Rights Watch,\u201d underscoring that all \u201cthreaten the right to privacy and could facilitate further suppression of online dissent or activism.\u201d\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.

The bipartisan group also endorsed changes to an agreement that generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days.</p>\n<p>The report comes as border officials say they are struggling to cope with an influx of Central American families, with U.S. Border Patrol apprehending a record-setting 53,000 families in March.</p>\n<p>&quot;There is a real crisis at our border,&quot; say the authors, who include immigration experts, lawyers, former federal officials and a medical doctor. &quot;An unprecedented surge in family unit migration from Central America is overwhelming our border agencies and our immigration system. This crisis is endangering children.&quot;</p>\n<p>The report calls for the establishment of new centers where migrant families would be processed by immigration officials, receive medical care and have their asylum cases heard by immigration judges. And they want to see a similar processing center established in Guatemala, near that country's border with Mexico, so migrants can make asylum claims without having to make the dangerous trek to the U.S.</p>\n<p>The report also calls for changes to a court settlement that would allow authorities to hold minor children who enter the country with guardians for longer than 20 days and changes that would allow border agents to take photographs and collect the biometric data of children under 14 &quot;in order to stem the recycling of children at the border and to rapidly determine the legitimacy of parentage claims,&quot; among other measures.</p>\n<p>It is unclear whether the Trump administration will consider any of the changes it is not already pushing Congress to undertake. The administration supports asylum changes and other steps to slow the influx of migrants at the border as President Donald Trump tries to make good on his 2016 campaign promises and energize his base going into 2020.</p>\n<p>But Katharina Obser of the Women's Refugee Commission said many of the ideas in the report would only exacerbate the problem.</p>\n<p>&quot;It is long overdue for the government to invest its existing funds in a comprehensive, legal and humane approach to protection at our borders,&quot; she said, but many of the report's recommendations &quot;would do little to better care for vulnerable families and children seeking protection in the United States.&quot;</p>\n<p>If implemented, the recommendations could &quot;exacerbate the situation at the border, further traumatize and endanger families and children and betray our legal and moral obligations to ensure access to a safe and fair asylum process,&quot; she said.</p>\n<p>&copy; Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

                "text": "A federal advisory group is calling for significant changes to how the federal government deals with the surge of migrant families that officials say is overwhelming the southern border.\nIn a draft report unveiled Tuesday, a committee of the Homeland Security Advisory Council called on the Trump administration to immediately establish three to four regional migrant processing centers along the southwest border with Mexico. The bipartisan group also endorsed changes to an agreement that generally bars the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days.\nThe report comes as border officials say they are struggling to cope with an influx of Central American families, with U.S. Border Patrol apprehending a record-setting 53,000 families in March.\n\"There is a real crisis at our border,\" say the authors, who include immigration experts, lawyers, former federal officials and a medical doctor. \"An unprecedented surge in family unit migration from Central America is overwhelming our border agencies and our immigration system. This crisis is endangering children.\"\nThe report calls for the establishment of new centers where migrant families would be processed by immigration officials, receive medical care and have their asylum cases heard by immigration judges. And they want to see a similar processing center established in Guatemala, near that country's border with Mexico, so migrants can make asylum claims without having to make the dangerous trek to the U.S.\nThe report also calls for changes to a court settlement that would allow authorities to hold minor children who enter the country with guardians for longer than 20 days and changes that would allow border agents to take photographs and collect the biometric data of children under 14 \"in order to stem the recycling of children at the border and to rapidly determine the legitimacy of parentage claims,\" among other measures.\nIt is unclear whether the Trump administration will consider any of the changes it is not already pushing Congress to undertake. The administration supports asylum changes and other steps to slow the influx of migrants at the border as President Donald Trump tries to make good on his 2016 campaign promises and energize his base going into 2020.\nBut Katharina Obser of the Women's Refugee Commission said many of the ideas in the report would only exacerbate the problem.\n\"It is long overdue for the government to invest its existing funds in a comprehensive, legal and humane approach to protection at our borders,\" she said, but many of the report's recommendations \"would do little to better care for vulnerable families and children seeking protection in the United States.\"\nIf implemented, the recommendations could \"exacerbate the situation at the border, further traumatize and endanger families and children and betray our legal and moral obligations to ensure access to a safe and fair asylum process,\" she said.\n\u00a9 Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Carey was president and chief operating officer at Twenty-First Century Fox from 2009 to 2015.\nThe newly spun-off media company, which will house assets including Fox News Channel and Fox Broadcast Network, is expected to bring in around $10 billion in annual revenue.\nBrokerage MoffettNathanson had started covering Fox with \"buy\" rating last week ahead of the debut, saying Fox Broadcasting Network and Fox News are \"an unrivaled pair of must-have\" content that will drive strong, industry-leading revenue growth for years.\nMeanwhile, Disney's deal got the last approval from Mexico's telecoms regulator last week, subject to conditions including the sale of Fox Sports channels.\nThe U.S. Justice Department too has asked Disney, which owns cable sports network ESPN, to divest Fox's 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets.\nDisney won a bidding war last year against cable company Comcast Corp to acquire Twenty-First Century's film and TV assets.\nShare of the company was trading marginally down 0.9 percent at $41.29 on Tuesday.",

Col. Ralph Peters trashed President Donald Trump during a TV appearance Tuesday night, calling him a &quot;draft dodger,&quot; &quot;physical coward,&quot; and &quot;disgraceful.&quot;</p>\n<p>Peters was on CNN's &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/shows/ac-360\">Anderson Cooper 360</a>&quot; and was asked about Trump's <a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/trump-attack-mccain-obamacare/2019/03/19/id/907684/\">most recent disparaging remarks</a> about the late Sen. John McCain, who died last August after a battle with brain cancer. The comments have resulted in a firestorm of pushback and <a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/john-mccain-war-hero-senator-never-trump/2019/03/19/id/907760/\">defense of McCain</a> from all sides.</p>\n<p>&quot;John McCain was, and in our hearts remains, the man Trump could never be. And Trump knows it. It's a classic case of male fears of an inadequacy,&quot; Peters said. &quot;It goes along perfectly with his lifelong obsession with having a woman on his arm to look like teenage boys' fantasies. He wants to show us all how tough he is. But he's not tough. He's a draft dodger and he appears to be a fiscal coward with a big mouth.&quot;</p>\n<p>Peters continued later during the interview, &quot;Look, Trump is just shameful. He is obscene. He is disgraceful. Pick your adjective.&quot;</p>\n<p>He added that Trump &quot;never did anything for this country&quot; and alleged that he &quot;was elected apparently with the help of a hostile power.&quot;</p>\n<p>Peters concluded his remarks on the Trump-McCain feud by saying Trump's &quot;jealousy&quot; toward the late senator, war hero, and POW could result in the United States getting into an unnecessary war.</p>\n<p>&quot;If there is a quality, an emotion, that will ruin lives and start wars, it is jealousy. And Trump appears to me to be consumed by it.&quot;</p>\n<p>&copy; 2020 Newsmax. All rights reserved.</p>",

Ralph Peters trashed President Donald Trump during a TV appearance Tuesday night, calling him a \"draft dodger,\" \"physical coward,\" and \"disgraceful.\"\nPeters was on CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" and was asked about Trump's most recent disparaging remarks about the late Sen. John McCain, who died last August after a battle with brain cancer. The comments have resulted in a firestorm of pushback and defense of McCain from all sides.\n\"John McCain was, and in our hearts remains, the man Trump could never be. And Trump knows it. It's a classic case of male fears of an inadequacy,\" Peters said. \"It goes along perfectly with his lifelong obsession with having a woman on his arm to look like teenage boys' fantasies. He wants to show us all how tough he is. But he's not tough. He's a draft dodger and he appears to be a fiscal coward with a big mouth.\"\nPeters continued later during the interview, \"Look, Trump is just shameful. He is obscene. He is disgraceful. Pick your adjective.\"\nHe added that Trump \"never did anything for this country\" and alleged that he \"was elected apparently with the help of a hostile power.\"\nPeters concluded his remarks on the Trump-McCain feud by saying Trump's \"jealousy\" toward the late senator, war hero, and POW could result in the United States getting into an unnecessary war.\n\"If there is a quality, an emotion, that will ruin lives and start wars, it is jealousy. And Trump appears to me to be consumed by it.\"\n\u00a9 2020 Newsmax. All rights reserved.",

Its people enjoy comprehensive health care under a national insurance program. Only Denmark, Belgium and Sweden spend a larger percentage of their economies on social welfare programs for working-age citizens, according to an <a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/income-redistribution-through-taxes-and-transfers-across-oecd-countries_bc7569c6-en#page11\">analysis</a> by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>\n<p>Even so, France is consumed by a ferocious and sustained outpouring of social unrest. The tumultuous, intermittently violent protests of the so-called Yellow Vest movement have shaken the country since they began in November, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/world/europe/yellow-vest-protests-france.html\">intensifying in recent weeks.</a></p>\n<p>President Emmanuel Macron had been preparing to address the nation last Monday to detail new measures in response to the demonstrations. But as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-fire.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer\"> Notre-Dame cathedral went up in flames</a> that evening, Mr. Macron scrapped his address, and used the devastation of a beloved and iconic monument to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation.html\">call for national unity</a>.</p>\n<p>It may be a hard sell. The anger drawing people to the barricades has been fueled by a sense that the national interest has long been undermined by Mr. Macron&rsquo;s own economic class, the globe-trotting financiers who have turned France into a sanctuary for the rich. That grievance was amplified by concerns that France&rsquo;s wealthiest would be able to benefit from tax breaks for their sizable donations to rebuild the cathedral.</p>\n<p>In part, the anger drawing people to the barricades reflects forces at work in much of the developed world, as the bounty of economic expansion flows disproportionately to the wealthy. But the demonstrations have also drawn fuel from more narrowly French laments: The traditionally generous social welfare system is increasingly neglecting key slices of the populace, especially young people, tripping deep-seated notions about fairness that date back to the French Revolution.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The government promotes equality very strongly,&rdquo; says Louis Maurin, director of French Inequality Watch, a research institution in the city of Tours. &ldquo;In every school in France, it&rsquo;s written on the walls: libert&eacute;, &eacute;galit&eacute;, fraternit&eacute;. Yet everyone thinks people are gaming the tax system. The feeling of being cheated can make you really angry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though France may seem a bastion of egalitarianism compared with conspicuously unequal societies like the United States, it has seen a widening of the gap separating the affluent from the rest of the nation. Average incomes for the richest 1 percent of French households doubled between 1983 and 2015, while the bottom 99 percent saw incomes rise by only one-fourth, according to the French economist Thomas Piketty.</p>\n<p>Beneath these broad indicators, France is cleaved by profound forms of inequality: between urban and rural communities; full-time employees and temporary workers; graduates of prestigious universities and the plebeian masses. And not least, between retirees, who maintain the divine right of pensions, and younger people excluded from social welfare programs.</p>\n<p>The Yellow Vests reverberate as a primal scream from working-class France at the tax-avoiding, wealth-hogging Parisian glitterati enabled by a government now headed by one of its own, Mr. Macron, a former investment banker. But the movement is also consumed with a historical French aspiration: protecting and even expanding national welfare programs in the face of worries over mounting debts and stagnant economic growth.</p>\n<p>Such tensions were already active when Mr. Macron assumed the presidency two years ago.</p>\n<p>He prescribed reforms aimed at rejuvenating the economy. In his telling, outdated strictures on business and institutionalized hostility toward the wealthy hindered entrepreneurialism. A labor code forged over centuries to protect workers discouraged investment, yielding an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macron vowed to make France hospitable to global capital, trading worker protections for economic revival. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/business/france-labor-reform-economy-macron.html\">He made it easier for employers to fire workers</a> on the assumption that this would enhance their inclination to hire. He cut taxes on the wealthiest French households.</p>\n<p>Outside France, financiers celebrated the young, charismatic new president who had replaced the narrative of decline with vibrancy. Yet inside France, and especially outside Paris, Mr. Macron&rsquo;s agenda resonated as class warfare.</p>\n<p>Eager to avoid perilously unpopular cuts to social welfare programs, he increased a range of taxes on the middle class and working poor. He was cutting taxes for people in designer suits, his fellow members of the Davos set, while sticking the bill on those donning work boots for a living.</p>\n<p>Such policies would probably produce anger anywhere. In France, where equality is more than a word engraved on monuments, but a moral code, it yielded rage.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Macron is out for the rich people,&rdquo; says Nadia Benkmis, 36, a mother of six here in Bourges, a modest town 130 miles south of Paris. &ldquo;He wants to exterminate poor people, like the way the Jews were exterminated.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She says this while standing in the parking lot of a local food bank, bearing two shopping bags full of donated groceries. The shelves inside offer a cornucopia befitting France: gleaming leeks, beefsteaks, Camembert cheese. For Ms. Benkmis, her weekly visits are a mortifying reminder of her lost station.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My family was rich when I was growing up,&rdquo; she says. Her own life has traced the arc of downward mobility. She used to clean houses, but gave that up when the youngest of her six children was born a year ago. She does not qualify for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>Her husband does not work, either. If he did, they would surrender the government benefits that now sustain them: some 1,200 euros ($1,350) a month in cash assistance for their children, plus a monthly housing subsidy of &euro;500.</p>\n<p>These sorts of calculations are enmeshed in the daily life of Bourges. Once a hub of munitions factories, the town has lost jobs in recent decades. Remaining operations are inclined to hire temporary workers, mirroring a national trend.</p>\n<p>Over the last 18 years, open-ended labor contracts in France have remained flat at about one million, while the number of contracts lasting less than a month exploded to 4.5 million from 1.6 million, according to Philippe Askenazy, a labor economist at the French National Center for Scientific Research. Only about half of those on short contracts are eligible for unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bosses prefer taking on temporary workers,&rdquo; says Virginie Bonnin, 40, who works in local auto parts plants. &ldquo;We are disposable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A single mother of three girls, Ms. Bonnin earns &euro;1,900 a month. She learns on Thursday nights what her hours will be for the coming week. When her jobs end, she is sustained by unemployment benefits of about &euro;1,400 a month.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the worst off,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s tricky. In those times, I will not eat meat so that the kids can eat meat.&rdquo; Her last summer vacation, a sacred French institution, was two years ago.</p>\n<p>Ms. Bonnin was provoked into joining the Yellow Vests by the same measure that mobilized much of the country, a tax on gasoline that was to take effect in January.</p>\n<p>Mr. Macron promoted it as a means of adapting to climate change. Outside major cities, where people rely on cars to get nearly everywhere, it supplied proof that the president was indifferent to the working class. &ldquo;Macron is concerned with the end of the world,&rdquo; one Yellow Vest slogan put it. &ldquo;We are concerned with the end of the month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That accusation endured even after Mr. Macron <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/world/europe/france-fuel-tax-yellow-vests.html\">suspended the gas tax</a> in the face of Yellow Vest furor.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Having to make sacrifices while rich people aren&rsquo;t paying taxes anymore,&rdquo; Ms. Bonnin says, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a sense of despair, as well as a sense of social injustice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This notion animates many of the Yellow Vest participants. More than a threat to livelihoods, Mr. Macron&rsquo;s reforms constitute a breach of the French social order, an attack on the understanding that the state looks out for struggling people.</p>\n<p>Such thinking holds special currency among white people born in France, who dominate the ranks of the Yellow Vests. Many echo sentiments heard across Europe amid an influx of Muslim migrants, and in the United States, where President Trump has fomented fear of immigrants. They claim that outsiders are capturing benefits that should be going to French-born working people.</p>\n<p>Coralie Annovazzi, 20, still lives with her parents as she works temporary waitressing jobs. She gets no cash assistance from the government, because people under 25 are not eligible.</p>\n<p>Poverty among French people 18 to 25 years old leapt to 14 percent in 2015 from 8.8 percent in 1984 after factoring in taxes and grants from the government, by Mr. Askenazy&rsquo;s reckoning. Over the same period, poverty among those age 51 to 65 dropped to 7 percent from 11 percent.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not enough for young people,&rdquo; Ms. Annovazzi says, as she sits inside a tent at a Yellow Vest camp.</p>\n<p>But her harshest words are reserved for the migrants living in a nearby motel, alongside a lifeless stretch of highway.</p>\n<p>Nearly 100 young men from Afghanistan, Sudan and other war-torn countries sit listlessly in their rooms, unable to work while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. They subsist on state grants of about &euro;200 a month.</p>\n<p>To Ms. Annovazzi, their presence reveals how native-born French people have seen their status usurped.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These migrants, they have gotten the latest sneakers, the latest smartphones,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;All of that is paid for by the state.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Claudine Malardie, 53, nods excitedly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re French, you don&rsquo;t get any assistance,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Give me a pot of black paint and I&rsquo;ll paint my face black, and then I will get benefits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In fact, Ms. Malardie does receives benefits, an &euro;860-a-month disability payment. She pays &euro;300 a month in rent for a state-subsidized apartment.</p>\n<p>Such attitudes have distanced the Yellow Vests from minority communities.</p>\n<p>In Grigny, a remote suburb south of Paris, African and Arab immigrant families fill dilapidated 15-story apartment towers. Elevators are frequently out of service, forcing even pregnant women to climb stairs. People complain that they cannot secure jobs, because a Grigny address is a mark of ill repute.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are treated like foreigners,&rdquo; says Checkene Sacko, 18, who was born in France, the son of immigrants from Mali.</p>\n<p>He and others in Grigny applaud the Yellow Vests for demanding better wages. But they recall how local protests over police brutality in 2005 were largely dismissed by the French public as the work of thugs, in contrast to the lionizing of the Yellow Vests. A tax on gas, they note, is a problem only for people who can afford cars.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Those are people who have jobs,&rdquo; Mr. Sacko says. &ldquo;They are mostly white people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If black people had thronged the demonstrations, he adds, the police &ldquo;would already have given themselves permission to shoot them all.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Racist tropes notwithstanding, the Yellow Vests have divined a decisive truth: Working poor people can no longer take for granted the succor of the French state.</p>\n<p>For most of the 20th century, France was ruled by the notion that progressive taxation and publicly financed social insurance programs were the best way to preserve amity.</p>\n<p>But in the early 1980s, the government began cutting support for low-income people. By 2014, barely 20 percent of government cash benefits were going to households in the bottom fifth of French incomes, according to <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/income-redistribution-through-taxes-and-transfers-across-oecd-countries_bc7569c6-en\">research</a> by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That was less than Finland (42 percent), Britain (33 percent) and even the United States (22 percent).</p>\n<p>Reversing that trend confronts difficult arithmetic. French government debt amounts to 97 percent of the nation&rsquo;s annual economic output, according to the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/GGXWDG_NGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD\">International Monetary Fund</a>. As one of 19 nations that share the euro currency, France is severely constrained in its ability to run further deficits, limiting social spending.</p>\n<p>In the face of the Yellow Vest demonstrations, President Macron <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/world/europe/yellow-vests-france-macron.html\">dropped some tax increases and lifted the minimum wage</a>. But that failed to mollify the protesters, leaving France in a familiar place: unable to jolt a stalled economy with spending, and unable to bolster aid for poor people. Unless, that is, Mr. Macron suddenly gained a proclivity for taxing rich people.</p>\n<p>In Bourges on a recent Saturday, Ms. Bonnin and other activists dawdle in a crosswalk, blocking cars in a show of dismay for the trajectory of French life. Three police officers ask them to allow traffic to flow, bringing a feint of compliance.</p>\n<p>One demonstrator carries a speaker blasting a protest song. &ldquo;Macron, shut your mouth,&rdquo; the chorus resounds. &ldquo;That will be good for France.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The demonstrators shout the lyrics in unison, and one of the policemen laughs.</p>",

                "text": "Alain Jocard/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nBOURGES, France \u2014 In a world seething with anger over the widening gap between the rich and everyone else, France stands out as a country elaborately engineered to protect social peace.\nIt has less economic inequality than the United States, Canada and Britain, according to the World Bank. Its people enjoy comprehensive health care under a national insurance program. Only Denmark, Belgium and Sweden spend a larger percentage of their economies on social welfare programs for working-age citizens, according to an analysis by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nEven so, France is consumed by a ferocious and sustained outpouring of social unrest. The tumultuous, intermittently violent protests of the so-called Yellow Vest movement have shaken the country since they began in November, intensifying in recent weeks.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron had been preparing to address the nation last Monday to detail new measures in response to the demonstrations. But as the Notre-Dame cathedral went up in flames that evening, Mr. Macron scrapped his address, and used the devastation of a beloved and iconic monument to call for national unity.\nIt may be a hard sell. The anger drawing people to the barricades has been fueled by a sense that the national interest has long been undermined by Mr. Macron\u2019s own economic class, the globe-trotting financiers who have turned France into a sanctuary for the rich. That grievance was amplified by concerns that France\u2019s wealthiest would be able to benefit from tax breaks for their sizable donations to rebuild the cathedral.\nIn part, the anger drawing people to the barricades reflects forces at work in much of the developed world, as the bounty of economic expansion flows disproportionately to the wealthy. But the demonstrations have also drawn fuel from more narrowly French laments: The traditionally generous social welfare system is increasingly neglecting key slices of the populace, especially young people, tripping deep-seated notions about fairness that date back to the French Revolution.\n\u201cThe government promotes equality very strongly,\u201d says Louis Maurin, director of French Inequality Watch, a research institution in the city of Tours. \u201cIn every school in France, it\u2019s written on the walls: libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9. Yet everyone thinks people are gaming the tax system. The feeling of being cheated can make you really angry.\u201d\nThough France may seem a bastion of egalitarianism compared with conspicuously unequal societies like the United States, it has seen a widening of the gap separating the affluent from the rest of the nation. Average incomes for the richest 1 percent of French households doubled between 1983 and 2015, while the bottom 99 percent saw incomes rise by only one-fourth, according to the French economist Thomas Piketty.\nBeneath these broad indicators, France is cleaved by profound forms of inequality: between urban and rural communities; full-time employees and temporary workers; graduates of prestigious universities and the plebeian masses. And not least, between retirees, who maintain the divine right of pensions, and younger people excluded from social welfare programs.\nThe Yellow Vests reverberate as a primal scream from working-class France at the tax-avoiding, wealth-hogging Parisian glitterati enabled by a government now headed by one of its own, Mr. Macron, a former investment banker. But the movement is also consumed with a historical French aspiration: protecting and even expanding national welfare programs in the face of worries over mounting debts and stagnant economic growth.\nSuch tensions were already active when Mr. Macron assumed the presidency two years ago.\nHe prescribed reforms aimed at rejuvenating the economy. In his telling, outdated strictures on business and institutionalized hostility toward the wealthy hindered entrepreneurialism. A labor code forged over centuries to protect workers discouraged investment, yielding an unemployment rate stuck above 9 percent.\nMr. Macron vowed to make France hospitable to global capital, trading worker protections for economic revival. He made it easier for employers to fire workers on the assumption that this would enhance their inclination to hire. He cut taxes on the wealthiest French households.\nOutside France, financiers celebrated the young, charismatic new president who had replaced the narrative of decline with vibrancy. Yet inside France, and especially outside Paris, Mr. Macron\u2019s agenda resonated as class warfare.\nEager to avoid perilously unpopular cuts to social welfare programs, he increased a range of taxes on the middle class and working poor. He was cutting taxes for people in designer suits, his fellow members of the Davos set, while sticking the bill on those donning work boots for a living.\nSuch policies would probably produce anger anywhere. In France, where equality is more than a word engraved on monuments, but a moral code, it yielded rage.\n\u201cMacron is out for the rich people,\u201d says Nadia Benkmis, 36, a mother of six here in Bourges, a modest town 130 miles south of Paris. \u201cHe wants to exterminate poor people, like the way the Jews were exterminated.\u201d\nShe says this while standing in the parking lot of a local food bank, bearing two shopping bags full of donated groceries. The shelves inside offer a cornucopia befitting France: gleaming leeks, beefsteaks, Camembert cheese. For Ms. Benkmis, her weekly visits are a mortifying reminder of her lost station.\n\u201cMy family was rich when I was growing up,\u201d she says. Her own life has traced the arc of downward mobility. She used to clean houses, but gave that up when the youngest of her six children was born a year ago. She does not qualify for unemployment benefits.\nHer husband does not work, either. If he did, they would surrender the government benefits that now sustain them: some 1,200 euros ($1,350) a month in cash assistance for their children, plus a monthly housing subsidy of \u20ac500.\nThese sorts of calculations are enmeshed in the daily life of Bourges. Once a hub of munitions factories, the town has lost jobs in recent decades. Remaining operations are inclined to hire temporary workers, mirroring a national trend.\nOver the last 18 years, open-ended labor contracts in France have remained flat at about one million, while the number of contracts lasting less than a month exploded to 4.5 million from 1.6 million, according to Philippe Askenazy, a labor economist at the French National Center for Scientific Research. Only about half of those on short contracts are eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\u201cBosses prefer taking on temporary workers,\u201d says Virginie Bonnin, 40, who works in local auto parts plants. \u201cWe are disposable.\u201d\nA single mother of three girls, Ms. Bonnin earns \u20ac1,900 a month. She learns on Thursday nights what her hours will be for the coming week. When her jobs end, she is sustained by unemployment benefits of about \u20ac1,400 a month.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the worst off,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s tricky. In those times, I will not eat meat so that the kids can eat meat.\u201d Her last summer vacation, a sacred French institution, was two years ago.\nMs. Bonnin was provoked into joining the Yellow Vests by the same measure that mobilized much of the country, a tax on gasoline that was to take effect in January.\nMr. Macron promoted it as a means of adapting to climate change. Outside major cities, where people rely on cars to get nearly everywhere, it supplied proof that the president was indifferent to the working class. \u201cMacron is concerned with the end of the world,\u201d one Yellow Vest slogan put it. \u201cWe are concerned with the end of the month.\u201d\nThat accusation endured even after Mr. Macron suspended the gas tax in the face of Yellow Vest furor.\n\u201cHaving to make sacrifices while rich people aren\u2019t paying taxes anymore,\u201d Ms. Bonnin says, \u201cthere\u2019s a sense of despair, as well as a sense of social injustice.\u201d\nThis notion animates many of the Yellow Vest participants. More than a threat to livelihoods, Mr. Macron\u2019s reforms constitute a breach of the French social order, an attack on the understanding that the state looks out for struggling people.\nSuch thinking holds special currency among white people born in France, who dominate the ranks of the Yellow Vests. Many echo sentiments heard across Europe amid an influx of Muslim migrants, and in the United States, where President Trump has fomented fear of immigrants. They claim that outsiders are capturing benefits that should be going to French-born working people.\nCoralie Annovazzi, 20, still lives with her parents as she works temporary waitressing jobs. She gets no cash assistance from the government, because people under 25 are not eligible.\nPoverty among French people 18 to 25 years old leapt to 14 percent in 2015 from 8.8 percent in 1984 after factoring in taxes and grants from the government, by Mr. Askenazy\u2019s reckoning. Over the same period, poverty among those age 51 to 65 dropped to 7 percent from 11 percent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough for young people,\u201d Ms. Annovazzi says, as she sits inside a tent at a Yellow Vest camp.\nBut her harshest words are reserved for the migrants living in a nearby motel, alongside a lifeless stretch of highway.\nNearly 100 young men from Afghanistan, Sudan and other war-torn countries sit listlessly in their rooms, unable to work while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed. They subsist on state grants of about \u20ac200 a month.\nTo Ms. Annovazzi, their presence reveals how native-born French people have seen their status usurped.\n\u201cThese migrants, they have gotten the latest sneakers, the latest smartphones,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of that is paid for by the state.\u201d\nClaudine Malardie, 53, nods excitedly.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re French, you don\u2019t get any assistance,\u201d she says. \u201cGive me a pot of black paint and I\u2019ll paint my face black, and then I will get benefits.\u201d\nIn fact, Ms. Malardie does receives benefits, an \u20ac860-a-month disability payment. She pays \u20ac300 a month in rent for a state-subsidized apartment.\nSuch attitudes have distanced the Yellow Vests from minority communities.\nIn Grigny, a remote suburb south of Paris, African and Arab immigrant families fill dilapidated 15-story apartment towers. Elevators are frequently out of service, forcing even pregnant women to climb stairs. People complain that they cannot secure jobs, because a Grigny address is a mark of ill repute.\n\u201cWe are treated like foreigners,\u201d says Checkene Sacko, 18, who was born in France, the son of immigrants from Mali.\nHe and others in Grigny applaud the Yellow Vests for demanding better wages. But they recall how local protests over police brutality in 2005 were largely dismissed by the French public as the work of thugs, in contrast to the lionizing of the Yellow Vests. A tax on gas, they note, is a problem only for people who can afford cars.\n\u201cThose are people who have jobs,\u201d Mr. Sacko says. \u201cThey are mostly white people.\u201d\nIf black people had thronged the demonstrations, he adds, the police \u201cwould already have given themselves permission to shoot them all.\u201d\nRacist tropes notwithstanding, the Yellow Vests have divined a decisive truth: Working poor people can no longer take for granted the succor of the French state.\nFor most of the 20th century, France was ruled by the notion that progressive taxation and publicly financed social insurance programs were the best way to preserve amity.\nBut in the early 1980s, the government began cutting support for low-income people. By 2014, barely 20 percent of government cash benefits were going to households in the bottom fifth of French incomes, according to research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That was less than Finland (42 percent), Britain (33 percent) and even the United States (22 percent).\nReversing that trend confronts difficult arithmetic. French government debt amounts to 97 percent of the nation\u2019s annual economic output, according to the International Monetary Fund. As one of 19 nations that share the euro currency, France is severely constrained in its ability to run further deficits, limiting social spending.\nIn the face of the Yellow Vest demonstrations, President Macron dropped some tax increases and lifted the minimum wage. But that failed to mollify the protesters, leaving France in a familiar place: unable to jolt a stalled economy with spending, and unable to bolster aid for poor people. Unless, that is, Mr. Macron suddenly gained a proclivity for taxing rich people.\nIn Bourges on a recent Saturday, Ms. Bonnin and other activists dawdle in a crosswalk, blocking cars in a show of dismay for the trajectory of French life. Three police officers ask them to allow traffic to flow, bringing a feint of compliance.\nOne demonstrator carries a speaker blasting a protest song. \u201cMacron, shut your mouth,\u201d the chorus resounds. \u201cThat will be good for France.\u201d\nThe demonstrators shout the lyrics in unison, and one of the policemen laughs.",

                "text": "Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin plans to hire Monica Crowley, a longtime Fox News commentator, as his top communications official, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMs. Crowley would succeed Tony Sayegh, who has been planning for several months to leave the Treasury in May. Her hiring would be another sign of the symbiosis between the Trump administration and Fox News, a launching pad for current White House officials and a place to land for those who leave. Mr. Sayegh is a former Fox News contributor.\nWhile the Treasury position is primarily a platform for promoting President Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, including his tax and trade policies, Ms. Crowley\u2019s appointment is almost certain to raise questions.\nShe was considered for a high-ranking National Security Council job in 2017 and was also mentioned as a candidate to become the White House press secretary. But she dropped out of contention after the emergence of allegations that she plagiarized key passages in her 2012 book, \u201cWhat the (Bleep) Just Happened?,\u201d from Wikipedia and newspaper articles.\nAfter CNN found evidence of plagiarism, HarperCollins withdrew the digital edition of the book. Separately, Politico found more than a dozen examples of passages in Ms. Crowley\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation that had been taken from scholarly works.\nAt the time, Mr. Trump\u2019s transition team portrayed the allegations as a political attack on Ms. Crowley.\nMs. Crowley could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. Fox News declined to comment, beyond saying she had not been formally affiliated with the network since 2016.\nSpeaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News in 2017, Ms. Crowley sought to rebut the accusations against her.\n\u201cWhat happened to me was a despicable, straight-up political hit job,\u201d she said, claiming without presenting evidence that the allegations about her had been \u201cdebunked.\u201d\nIn the interview with Mr. Hannity, Ms. Crowley said members of the Washington establishment were trying to destroy Mr. Trump. \u201cThey want him in prison,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a war.\u201d\nThe choice of Ms. Crowley is a surprising one for Mr. Mnuchin, who has been seen as a voice of moderation in the Trump administration. In recent years, Ms. Crowley has emerged as a conservative firebrand, assailing Democrats and amplifying conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama\u2019s heritage.\nIn a collection of videos unearthed by the liberal group Media Matters, Ms. Crowley described Mr. Obama\u2019s policies as \u201cun-American\u201d and said questions about his birth certificate were \u201cvery legitimate.\u201d Mr. Trump was a leading voice of the so-called birther movement, which was built on questioning, without factual basis, where Mr. Obama was born.\n\u201cIt all feeds into this idea that somehow, fair or not, Obama is not one of us,\u201d Ms. Crowley told the Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, who said she was being unfair to Mr. Obama.\nMs. Crowley has been a fixture on Fox News and in conservative media for decades, having joined the network as an international affairs analyst in 1998. Before that, she worked as a foreign policy assistant and research consultant to former President Richard M. Nixon. She received her Ph.D. from Columbia University.\nThe Treasury appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, is ultimately Mr. Trump\u2019s to make. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA second person familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking about the decision said the White House wanted to add staff members who, like Ms. Crowley, could be counted on to fiercely defend Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on television as the 2020 election season gets into full swing. It was not clear how much airtime Ms. Crowley would get, however, as Mr. Mnuchin likes to keep close control over the Treasury\u2019s public communications.\nCredible allegations of plagiarism would normally be problematic for securing a senior role in an administration, especially a job that entailed providing potentially market-moving information to the public. But Mr. Trump has not been deterred from picking others with tarnished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for high-profile positions, recently standing behind Stephen Moore and Herman Cain as his choices to be governors of the Federal Reserve despite questions about their qualifications and personal lives.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s communications team has been in transition since Bill Shine, a former Fox News co-president, resigned last month as deputy chief of staff for communications.\nMr. Mnuchin\u2019s staff has also been in flux. Eli Miller, his chief of staff, departed this month to join the Blackstone Group, the giant investment firm. David Malpass, the under secretary for international affairs, left to become president of the World Bank.\nMr. Mnuchin is girding for what will probably to be a long and intense battle with Congress as House Democrats, using a provision of the tax code, have formally requested six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns. Mr. Mnuchin, who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal aides and who oversees the Internal Revenue Service, has resisted turning over the returns, citing taxpayer privacy.\nMs. Crowley will have a formidable task in succeeding Mr. Sayegh.

During a single week in February, BuzzFeed reported that her company was running advertisements alongside anti-vaccine content; there was a nationwide panic over the platform abetting child suicide; and a viral video showed how pedophiles were flourishing on the site.</p>\n<p>And then there was the bestiality.</p>\n<p>Thumbnail images implying human-animal sex were discovered next to children&rsquo;s videos, and after an uproar, Ms. Wojcicki was obliged to call a staff meeting to address it. The topic, she allowed during a recent interview, was one &ldquo;I never thought I would be handling.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki, 50, was sitting in a conference room at YouTube headquarters in suburban San Bruno, Calif., wearing jeans, a cardigan and an expression of pure stoicism. In an industry that celebrates eccentricity, Ms. Wojcicki presents as exceedingly normal, bordering on boring, even as elements of her digital realm burst into the real world in forms that are increasingly grotesque and sometimes dangerous.</p>\n<p>Several months earlier, not far from where we sat, Ms. Wojcicki had spent 40 minutes hiding from an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/youtube-shooting.html\">active shooter</a>: a YouTube user furious about new ad standards, who shot three employees before taking her own life. Ms. Wojcicki said she knew that her policy changes could &ldquo;upset some people,&rdquo; but &ldquo;seeing that someone could be so angry that they would come here is really hard.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her tenure as C.E.O. wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be dominated by pedophilia and attempted mass murder. When she got the job, in 2014, Ms. Wojcicki was hailed straightforwardly as the most powerful woman in advertising, someone who&rsquo;d helped turn on the cash spigots in her time at Google and would presumably repeat the trick at YouTube. In the five years since, Ms. Wojcicki has introduced new forms of ads as well as subscription offerings for music, original content and the cord-cutting service YouTube TV. But somewhere along the line, her job became less about growth and more about toxic containment.</p>\n<p>Political figures and tech luminaries alike are castigating YouTube for not doing enough to rein in the crooks, crackpots, racists, Russian agents and charlatans who call the platform home. New horrors are ceaseless &mdash; last month, just before a terrorist in New Zealand massacred 50 people, he urged people to subscribe to a popular YouTuber &mdash; and reinforce the view that the platform is corroding society.</p>\n<p>Remarkably, for a person who oversees a website with more daily visitors than Facebook, Ms. Wojcicki has managed to keep a low profile and avoid much of the blame. Last year, when other social media executives were summoned to Congress for a scolding, she was not invited. She stayed home and campaigned against a new European Union law that could hold services like YouTube liable if their users upload copyrighted content.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html\">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/technology/lean-in-sheryl-sandberg-problem.html\">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/world/asia/twitter-jack-dorsey-myanmar-rohingya.html\">Jack Dorsey</a> and others have gotten their share of public scrutiny, Ms. Wojcicki largely has not. I wanted to get a better sense of what she was like as a C.E.O., how she was trying to tame YouTube&rsquo;s hydra of issues and whether there was any sense of urgency within YouTube. And so over the last several months, I spoke to more than a dozen current and former YouTube and Google employees and interviewed Ms. Wojcicki three times.</p>\n<p>What I found was both reassuring and alarming. At the top of the world&rsquo;s largest and most volatile video platform is a calm, levelheaded person. But her deliberate style may be at odds with the pace and scale of horrors and just plain stupidity that relentlessly arises on YouTube.</p>\n<p>On April 2, Bloomberg News published an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-02/youtube-executives-ignored-warnings-letting-toxic-videos-run-rampant\">article</a> that painted a damning portrait of her and other YouTube brass &mdash; so focused on maximizing usage statistics that they looked the other way when employees raised concerns about the company&rsquo;s recommendation system. Ms. Wojcicki seemed taken aback. In an April 7 interview, she said YouTube has not ignored its problem with hosting extreme and conspiracy-minded content. She said it was a large and complex issue and the company was starting to make a dent. She wasn&rsquo;t defensive, but defiant and &mdash; most surprising for someone usually so measured &mdash; a little angry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like there is one lever we can pull and say, &lsquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s make all these changes,&rsquo; and everything would be solved,&rdquo; Ms. Wojcicki said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how it works.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At one policy review meeting I observed in San Bruno, her methodical approach was on full display. In a narrow conference room lined with whiteboards and TV screens, she sat quietly with a dozen YouTube employees, watching a video called &ldquo;Condom Challenge,&rdquo; in which <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aDMd6BeReAI?t=95\">water-filled prophylactics fell onto people&rsquo;s heads in extreme slow motion</a>. Rather than bursting, the condoms inverted and engulfed their faces like a fishbowl. Ms. Wojcicki pondered whether the clip, which has nearly 15 million views, was merely juvenile or crossed the line to life-threatening. Like so much on YouTube, such &ldquo;challenges&rdquo; &mdash; when creators perform stunts and call out a friend to do the same &mdash; often begin as harmless memes, but morph into something more problematic.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki and her staff considered their thicket of policies. A &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; (risk of bodily harm) activity could stay on YouTube as long as no minors were involved. But &ldquo;ultrahazardous&rdquo; (risk of death) challenges would be removed. One staffer ventured that the condom challenge seemed to belong in the former category. Ms. Wojcicki disagreed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason we want people putting any kind of plastic over their head,&rdquo; she said, peering over the screen of her open laptop. But the video stayed up. For every minute Ms. Wojcicki spent discussing it, users uploaded to the site an additional 500 hours of footage.</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;The first cousin of the Google royal family&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>Unlike many of her tech-C.E.O. peers, Ms. Wojcicki (pronounced &ldquo;Woe-jisky&rdquo;) does not have a tidy origin story to tell reporters; there was no aha! moment in a dorm room that has been polished and embellished over the years. She didn&rsquo;t drop out of Harvard; she graduated. But in 1998, Ms. Wojcicki and her husband rented <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SusanWojcicki/status/1045492035380105216\">part of their Menlo Park, Calif., home</a> for $1,700 a month to a pair of Stanford University graduate students named Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They had just started a search engine called Google.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki was working for Intel at the time, and one day, she wasn&rsquo;t able to find an important piece of information because Google was down. She realized that she had become dependent on &ldquo;the site developed by<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqOdhRW6HE\"> those two dudes in my garage</a>.&rdquo; Ms. Wojcicki joined Google as its 16th employee and its first marketing manager.</p>\n<p>With a baby on the way, she was going to work for a company with no revenue. She helped turn Google into a juggernaut, developing its signature advertising product, AdWords, and overseeing its first foray into content sharing, called Google Video. In 2006, swallowing her pride, she encouraged Google to acquire a rival service called YouTube for $1.65 billion. (Morgan Stanley recently estimated that the division is now worth $160 billion.)</p>\n<p>Over the years, Ms. Wojcicki built a personal fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions, and she remains a close confidant of Mr. Page, who is now the chief executive of Google&rsquo;s parent, Alphabet. One former executive told me, &ldquo;Susan is the first cousin of the Google royal family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki&rsquo;s biological family is remarkably accomplished. She is the oldest of three sisters; the middle one, Janet, is an anthropologist, epidemiologist and former Fulbright scholar; and the youngest, Anne, co-founded 23andMe, the DNA testing company. (Anne was also married to Mr. Brin until 2015.)</p>\n<p>Being part of a high-profile clan can cause confusion. Chris Dale, a YouTube spokesman, once learned that People magazine planned to run a story that Susan Wojcicki was dating Alex Rodriguez, the former New York Yankees slugger. Mr. Dale recalls sheepishly calling his boss &mdash; who had been married for more than 20 years &mdash; in the middle of a parent-teacher meeting to ask if she was having an affair. She was not. Anne, not Susan, had been seeing Mr. Rodriguez.</p>\n<p>Since taking over YouTube, fame has been something Ms. Wojcicki has tried to avoid. But she is warm and approachable in person, and for one recent interview, she arrived at the office dressed like any other Google employee, with black cowboy boots and a backpack slung over one shoulder, ready to discuss her track record. &ldquo;One way I think about some of the decisions is putting myself in the future and thinking: in five or 10 years, what will they say?&rdquo; Ms. Wojcicki said. &ldquo;If someone were to look back on the decisions that we&rsquo;re making, would they feel we were on the right side of history? Would I feel proud? Will my children feel like I made good decisions?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Whether vacuous or violent, YouTube troubles arise at a dumbfounding pace. Last year, YouTube banned both the<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/01/13/teens-are-daring-each-other-to-eat-tide-pods-we-dont-need-to-tell-you-thats-a-bad-idea/?utm_term=.73651bf0ef37\"> &ldquo;Tide Pod&rdquo; challenge</a>, which involved biting into laundry detergent pods, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ny-news-lackin-challenge-guns-shooting-death-craze-20190103-story.html\">No lackin</a>&rdquo; videos, in which participants aim guns at each other. Confronted by one crisis after another, Ms. Wojcicki has introduced policies to curb the spread of problematic videos and raised the bar on which videos can carry advertising. The challenge is cleaning up the mess while keeping her various constituencies &mdash; users, creators, advertisers, parents, lawmakers &mdash; happy, or at least not irate.</p>\n<p>When she became C.E.O., Ms. Wojcicki inherited an audacious goal: Get users to watch more than one billion hours of videos every day, a tenfold increase from 2012. She kept the target in place and made some changes at the margins. In 2016, YouTube scaled back recommendations of sensational and clickbait-y videos, because it found users were drawn to watching them but later regretted it &mdash; a lot like eating junk food.</p>\n<p>Two of Ms. Wojcicki&rsquo;s inflection points came in spring 2017. That March, major advertisers, including AT&amp;T and Johnson &amp; Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/business/media/youtube-advertisers-offensive-content.html\">boycotted</a> the service after reports that their messages appeared on offensive content. Then, in June, three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge. Media reports said one of the attackers had watched the inflammatory YouTube sermons of an Islamic cleric. Ms. Wojcicki said the attack clarified for her that her company could no longer keep content at arm&rsquo;s length and hide behind a broadly articulated set of community guidelines.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We needed to have a deeper understanding of the issues, we needed to have much deeper enforcement and we needed to have much more precision in our policies,&rdquo; Ms. Wojcicki said. In the months that followed, she added thousands of human reviewers to examine controversial videos and created an &ldquo;intelligence desk&rdquo; to identify percolating issues on the internet more quickly. Her staff also deployed Google&rsquo;s machine-learning systems to flag extremist content.</p>\n<p>These days, YouTube says it is pursuing what the company calls &ldquo;responsible growth.&rdquo; When asked what that means, Ms. Wojcicki said an easy explanation was a challenge.</p>\n<p>To boil it down: YouTube wants to remove the content that violates its policies more quickly and effectively; promote better, more authoritative material and limit the spread of videos that are potentially harmful but do not break the rules.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki said the third category, so-called borderline content, has been the most challenging. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was changing its algorithm to stop recommending material like conspiracy videos that can become a gateway to the unsavory.</p>\n<p>Starting with the United States, YouTube said it would employ human raters from across the country to evaluate certain content. Those judgments will help inform what the recommendation engine flags. (Clearly, the algorithms need attention. This week, they mistakenly added information about the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/04/as-notre-dame-burned-an-algorithmic-error-at-youtube-put-information-about-9-11-under-news-videos/\">footage of the Notre Dame fire</a>.) YouTube said it plans to introduce the change to another 20 countries this year, deploying raters in each market to understand the preferences of local users.</p>\n<p>When asked why she didn&rsquo;t act sooner, Ms. Wojcicki said she wished she had. &ldquo;If I were to go back in time, I certainly would have accelerated all of these features, and I would have accelerated all of this work because now I&rsquo;ve realized how important it is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I realized at the time, too. We always thought it was important, but I can&rsquo;t emphasize the number of people and systems that it is taking for us to implement it.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;Everybody is angry at you all the time&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>At the YouTube policy meeting I observed, Ms. Wojcicki asked 37 questions in one hour. They were short. And direct. In one exchange, a YouTube staffer (I agreed to not use their names) briefed her on an uptick in users uploading soft-core pornography.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki: &ldquo;You feel good about the changes we made, and that that group has been managed?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Staffer: &ldquo;Yes. I mean, they&rsquo;ll keep evolving.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki: &ldquo;How did we find it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The staffer described an anomaly-detection system.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki: &ldquo;And then you terminated those accounts?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Staffer: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>YouTube&rsquo;s mammoth video corpus and flow of new kinds of content present a challenge that simply never ends. Another test is always around the corner, whether it be the 2020 presidential elections or A.I.-generated &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=nytimes+deepfakes&oq=nytimes+deepf&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2j69i64.4273j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\">deepfake</a>&rdquo; technology. In the meantime, it&rsquo;s hard to declare progress, much less victory, when the failures are so notable.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki said that seeing harmful videos and the hateful behavior of people online is the worst part of her job. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably not even rewarding, because everybody is angry at you all the time,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I think it&rsquo;s probably some of the most important work that I will do in my career, because it&rsquo;s setting a standard of responsibility for the internet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She has become a pariah among a vocal minority of YouTube enthusiasts who think she has gone too far to alter what made YouTube popular in the first place. When Ms. Wojcicki started her own YouTube channel in fall 2017, her videos were overrun by negative comments, including anti-Semitic remarks and insults about her looks and manner of speaking. Her first post &mdash; a slick montage with YouTube stars offering advice on making videos &mdash; received five times as many thumbs-down votes as thumbs-up. When YouTube published a year-in-review compilation, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/technology/youtube-rewind-video.html\">which excluded reference to its troubles</a>, it became the most disliked video in the site&rsquo;s history. Even Ms. Wojcicki&rsquo;s kids, she said, told her that it was &ldquo;cringey.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The growing backlash against YouTube has complicated some personal relationships. Marc Benioff, the chairman of Salesforce, said last year that social media was potentially as harmful as cigarettes and needed to be regulated. Ms. Wojcicki has been a Salesforce board director since 2014, and Mr. Benioff is a longtime acquaintance. For this article, YouTube arranged for an interview with Mr. Benioff to provide insight about her. But on the morning of a scheduled call, Mr. Benioff was feuding on Twitter with its C.E.O. about a proposed tax to pay for services for the homeless in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>He joined the call 40 minutes late, saying he only had five minutes to spare. When I asked how Ms. Wojcicki reacted to his comments about social media, Mr. Benioff became upset. He said he wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;prepared to answer&rdquo; the question and had expected to speak about her leadership style. Then he ended the call.</p>\n<p>In a written statement sent a week later, Mr. Benioff said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re living in a crisis of trust, and as I&rsquo;ve said before that if our industry doesn&rsquo;t self-regulate, the government will do it for us. But I don&rsquo;t think that reality fazes someone like Susan because she knows, no matter what, the power of trust and transparency far outweighs whatever regulation that may come our way.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;She is not going anywhere&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to judge a C.E.O.&rsquo;s performance, of course, is to study their company&rsquo;s financial results. In the case of YouTube, that&rsquo;s a matter of guesswork. The company is a few layers deep within Alphabet and its financial results are not disclosed. YouTube reveals data points in drips and drabs, but the numbers are too absent of context to be of much use. On the last earnings call with analysts, for example, Google said that the number of YouTube channels with more than one million subscribers nearly doubled last year, and that the number of creators making more than $10,000 annually grew more than 40 percent. But investors do not know YouTube&rsquo;s profit or costs, or how Ms. Wojcicki has affected them over time.</p>\n<p>From what we can glean, though, YouTube&rsquo;s business appears to be thriving. Alphabet cited its &ldquo;strong contribution&rdquo; as a key factor for the company&rsquo;s record profits in the fourth quarter. Analysts estimate that YouTube&rsquo;s annual revenue has surpassed $15 billion and is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year.</p>\n<p>If building a business with Netflix-size revenue inside Alphabet wasn&rsquo;t enough to gain Ms. Wojcicki job security from YouTube&rsquo;s policing struggles, there&rsquo;s also the Larry factor. She technically reports to Sundar Pichai, Google&rsquo;s chief executive, but she answers to Mr. Page. She remains one of the few people at the company with &ldquo;walk-in access&rdquo; to the reclusive co-founder, one Google executive told me. &ldquo;She is not going anywhere,&rdquo; this person said.</p>\n<p>One reason Ms. Wojcicki defies easy characterization is that her core function keeps changing. Today, her job is to be something like the standards czar of an anarchic civilization. Before that, when YouTube started home-growing celebrity icons, she was a budding media mogul. But in whatever role YouTube has needed her to assume, Ms. Wojcicki has not lost sight of the skill she learned early on at Google: how to keep advertisers happy.</p>\n<p>Marc S. Pritchard, Procter &amp; Gamble&rsquo;s chief brand officer, who is responsible for one of the biggest advertising budgets in the world, said his company has had some rocky moments with YouTube in the last few years, and that Ms. Wojcicki has been a steadying presence.</p>\n<p>Like other major marketers, P.&amp;G. stopped spending on YouTube in early 2017 when it found its advertisements running next to videos with violence, extreme language and other consumer-unfriendly qualities. When Mr. Pritchard called Ms. Wojcicki with the bad news, he said, the conversation was not contentious. She told him: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re an important partner. We&rsquo;re going to work together to get this fixed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Almost a year after P.&amp;G. put its wallet away, the &ldquo;Tide Pod challenge&rdquo; started to spread across YouTube. Tide is one of P.&amp;G.&rsquo;s flagship brands, and Mr. Pritchard said that late one Friday night, Ms. Wojcicki called him with reassurances that her company was on top of the problem. She added a metaphor about the scale of the challenge: YouTube had started out as a small city, but it had grown into a metropolis.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve grown well beyond a metropolis,&rdquo; Mr. Pritchard recalled telling her. &ldquo;You grew into a galaxy. That has implications beyond anything you would have ever known.&rdquo; Within a few hours, the worst Tide Pod videos were scrubbed from YouTube, and the platform changed its algorithm so anyone searching for them would be shown a safety video.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;No debate, just action,&rdquo; said Mr. Pritchard. A few months later, P.&amp;G. announced that it would resume advertising on YouTube.</p>\n<p>Over Presidents&rsquo; Day weekend, Ms. Wojcicki was traveling with her family when another ad disaster struck. A YouTuber named Matt Watson posted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O13G5A5w5P0\">a video</a> with the title &ldquo;YouTube is Facilitating the Sexual Exploitation of Children, and It&rsquo;s Being Monetized.&rdquo; It demonstrated how pedophiles were coordinating their behavior on the site, including on some videos sponsored by big brands, and those companies <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/technology/youtube-pedophiles.html\">started to pull their advertising</a>.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki asked her staff to do a &ldquo;content review&rdquo; to remove any problematic videos and comments. She coordinated with senior executives and the &ldquo;incident commander,&rdquo; a rotating position she had created to ensure that every &ldquo;escalation&rdquo; &mdash; that&rsquo;s corporate-speak for &ldquo;a terrible thing found on our platform&rdquo; &mdash; had a point person overseeing the response. Eventually, YouTube said it removed inappropriate comments from thousands of videos and would disable comments permanently on most content featuring children under 13.</p>\n<p>Ms. Wojcicki said while the situation was regrettable, it also demonstrated that some of YouTube&rsquo;s new policies are helping. YouTube was able to turn off comments on millions of videos over a holiday weekend, something it would have struggled to do in the past.</p>\n<p>A month later, when YouTube&rsquo;s human reviewers were overwhelmed by a deluge of videos of the mass shooting in New Zealand &mdash; at one point, footage of the shooting was being uploaded every second &mdash; Ms. Wojcicki said the company intentionally disabled search functions. It also bypassed human reviewers and let its computers immediately take down any videos that were automatically flagged.</p>\n<p>She said each horrible incident helps the company be better prepared for the next one. And there will always be a next one, as long as YouTube remains open to allowing anyone with an internet connection to upload a video.</p>\n<p>After a long conversation, Ms. Wojcicki became introspective. She said she joined Google because she wanted to do something meaningful with her life, and saw the company&rsquo;s mission of helping people find the right information as inspiring. But now she recognizes that her ultimate legacy will be whether YouTube can get a handle on its problems.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I know we can do better, but we&rsquo;re going to get there. We&rsquo;ll get to a point where we have solved a lot of these issues, and I feel like we&rsquo;ve already made significant progress,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I own this problem, and I&rsquo;m going to fix it.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Illustration by Minh Uong; Photograph by Peter Prato for The New York Times\nEven by the nightmarish standards of the empire she oversees, Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive officer of YouTube, has had a dreadful start to 2019. During a single week in February, BuzzFeed reported that her company was running advertisements alongside anti-vaccine content; there was a nationwide panic over the platform abetting child suicide; and a viral video showed how pedophiles were flourishing on the site.\nAnd then there was the bestiality.\nThumbnail images implying human-animal sex were discovered next to children\u2019s videos, and after an uproar, Ms. Wojcicki was obliged to call a staff meeting to address it. The topic, she allowed during a recent interview, was one \u201cI never thought I would be handling.\u201d\nMs. Wojcicki, 50, was sitting in a conference room at YouTube headquarters in suburban San Bruno, Calif., wearing jeans, a cardigan and an expression of pure stoicism. In an industry that celebrates eccentricity, Ms. Wojcicki presents as exceedingly normal, bordering on boring, even as elements of her digital realm burst into the real world in forms that are increasingly grotesque and sometimes dangerous.\nSeveral months earlier, not far from where we sat, Ms. Wojcicki had spent 40 minutes hiding from an active shooter: a YouTube user furious about new ad standards, who shot three employees before taking her own life. Ms. Wojcicki said she knew that her policy changes could \u201cupset some people,\u201d but \u201cseeing that someone could be so angry that they would come here is really hard.\u201d\nHer tenure as C.E.O. wasn\u2019t supposed to be dominated by pedophilia and attempted mass murder. When she got the job, in 2014, Ms. Wojcicki was hailed straightforwardly as the most powerful woman in advertising, someone who\u2019d helped turn on the cash spigots in her time at Google and would presumably repeat the trick at YouTube. In the five years since, Ms. Wojcicki has introduced new forms of ads as well as subscription offerings for music, original content and the cord-cutting service YouTube TV. But somewhere along the line, her job became less about growth and more about toxic containment.\nPolitical figures and tech luminaries alike are castigating YouTube for not doing enough to rein in the crooks, crackpots, racists, Russian agents and charlatans who call the platform home. New horrors are ceaseless \u2014 last month, just before a terrorist in New Zealand massacred 50 people, he urged people to subscribe to a popular YouTuber \u2014 and reinforce the view that the platform is corroding society.\nRemarkably, for a person who oversees a website with more daily visitors than Facebook, Ms. Wojcicki has managed to keep a low profile and avoid much of the blame. Last year, when other social media executives were summoned to Congress for a scolding, she was not invited. She stayed home and campaigned against a new European Union law that could hold services like YouTube liable if their users upload copyrighted content.\nWhile Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and others have gotten their share of public scrutiny, Ms. Wojcicki largely has not. I wanted to get a better sense of what she was like as a C.E.O., how she was trying to tame YouTube\u2019s hydra of issues and whether there was any sense of urgency within YouTube. And so over the last several months, I spoke to more than a dozen current and former YouTube and Google employees and interviewed Ms. Wojcicki three times.\nWhat I found was both reassuring and alarming. At the top of the world\u2019s largest and most volatile video platform is a calm, levelheaded person. But her deliberate style may be at odds with the pace and scale of horrors and just plain stupidity that relentlessly arises on YouTube.\nOn April 2, Bloomberg News published an article that painted a damning portrait of her and other YouTube brass \u2014 so focused on maximizing usage statistics that they looked the other way when employees raised concerns about the company\u2019s recommendation system. Ms. Wojcicki seemed taken aback. In an April 7 interview, she said YouTube has not ignored its problem with hosting extreme and conspiracy-minded content. She said it was a large and complex issue and the company was starting to make a dent. She wasn\u2019t defensive, but defiant and \u2014 most surprising for someone usually so measured \u2014 a little angry.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there is one lever we can pull and say, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make all these changes,\u2019 and everything would be solved,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works.\u201d\nAt one policy review meeting I observed in San Bruno, her methodical approach was on full display. In a narrow conference room lined with whiteboards and TV screens, she sat quietly with a dozen YouTube employees, watching a video called \u201cCondom Challenge,\u201d in which water-filled prophylactics fell onto people\u2019s heads in extreme slow motion. Rather than bursting, the condoms inverted and engulfed their faces like a fishbowl. Ms. Wojcicki pondered whether the clip, which has nearly 15 million views, was merely juvenile or crossed the line to life-threatening. Like so much on YouTube, such \u201cchallenges\u201d \u2014 when creators perform stunts and call out a friend to do the same \u2014 often begin as harmless memes, but morph into something more problematic.\nMs. Wojcicki and her staff considered their thicket of policies. A \u201cdangerous\u201d (risk of bodily harm) activity could stay on YouTube as long as no minors were involved. But \u201cultrahazardous\u201d (risk of death) challenges would be removed. One staffer ventured that the condom challenge seemed to belong in the former category. Ms. Wojcicki disagreed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason we want people putting any kind of plastic over their head,\u201d she said, peering over the screen of her open laptop. But the video stayed up. For every minute Ms. Wojcicki spent discussing it, users uploaded to the site an additional 500 hours of footage.\n\u2018The first cousin of the Google royal family\u2019\nUnlike many of her tech-C.E.O. peers, Ms. Wojcicki (pronounced \u201cWoe-jisky\u201d) does not have a tidy origin story to tell reporters; there was no aha! moment in a dorm room that has been polished and embellished over the years. She didn\u2019t drop out of Harvard; she graduated. But in 1998, Ms. Wojcicki and her husband rented part of their Menlo Park, Calif., home for $1,700 a month to a pair of Stanford University graduate students named Larry Page and Sergey Brin. They had just started a search engine called Google.\nMs. Wojcicki was working for Intel at the time, and one day, she wasn\u2019t able to find an important piece of information because Google was down. She realized that she had become dependent on \u201cthe site developed by those two dudes in my garage.\u201d Ms. Wojcicki joined Google as its 16th employee and its first marketing manager.\nWith a baby on the way, she was going to work for a company with no revenue. She helped turn Google into a juggernaut, developing its signature advertising product, AdWords, and overseeing its first foray into content sharing, called Google Video. In 2006, swallowing her pride, she encouraged Google to acquire a rival service called YouTube for $1.65 billion. (Morgan Stanley recently estimated that the division is now worth $160 billion.)\nOver the years, Ms. Wojcicki built a personal fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions, and she remains a close confidant of Mr. Page, who is now the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet. One former executive told me, \u201cSusan is the first cousin of the Google royal family.\u201d\nMs. Wojcicki\u2019s biological family is remarkably accomplished. She is the oldest of three sisters; the middle one, Janet, is an anthropologist, epidemiologist and former Fulbright scholar; and the youngest, Anne, co-founded 23andMe, the DNA testing company. (Anne was also married to Mr. Brin until 2015.)\nBeing part of a high-profile clan can cause confusion. Chris Dale, a YouTube spokesman, once learned that People magazine planned to run a story that Susan Wojcicki was dating Alex Rodriguez, the former New York Yankees slugger. Mr. Dale recalls sheepishly calling his boss \u2014 who had been married for more than 20 years \u2014 in the middle of a parent-teacher meeting to ask if she was having an affair. She was not. Anne, not Susan, had been seeing Mr. Rodriguez.\nSince taking over YouTube, fame has been something Ms. Wojcicki has tried to avoid. But she is warm and approachable in person, and for one recent interview, she arrived at the office dressed like any other Google employee, with black cowboy boots and a backpack slung over one shoulder, ready to discuss her track record. \u201cOne way I think about some of the decisions is putting myself in the future and thinking: in five or 10 years, what will they say?\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cIf someone were to look back on the decisions that we\u2019re making, would they feel we were on the right side of history? Would I feel proud? Will my children feel like I made good decisions?\u201d\nWhether vacuous or violent, YouTube troubles arise at a dumbfounding pace. Last year, YouTube banned both the \u201cTide Pod\u201d challenge, which involved biting into laundry detergent pods, and \u201cNo lackin\u201d videos, in which participants aim guns at each other. Confronted by one crisis after another, Ms. Wojcicki has introduced policies to curb the spread of problematic videos and raised the bar on which videos can carry advertising. The challenge is cleaning up the mess while keeping her various constituencies \u2014 users, creators, advertisers, parents, lawmakers \u2014 happy, or at least not irate.\nWhen she became C.E.O., Ms. Wojcicki inherited an audacious goal: Get users to watch more than one billion hours of videos every day, a tenfold increase from 2012. She kept the target in place and made some changes at the margins. In 2016, YouTube scaled back recommendations of sensational and clickbait-y videos, because it found users were drawn to watching them but later regretted it \u2014 a lot like eating junk food.\nTwo of Ms. Wojcicki\u2019s inflection points came in spring 2017. That March, major advertisers, including AT&T and Johnson & Johnson, boycotted the service after reports that their messages appeared on offensive content. Then, in June, three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge. Media reports said one of the attackers had watched the inflammatory YouTube sermons of an Islamic cleric. Ms. Wojcicki said the attack clarified for her that her company could no longer keep content at arm\u2019s length and hide behind a broadly articulated set of community guidelines.\n\u201cWe needed to have a deeper understanding of the issues, we needed to have much deeper enforcement and we needed to have much more precision in our policies,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. In the months that followed, she added thousands of human reviewers to examine controversial videos and created an \u201cintelligence desk\u201d to identify percolating issues on the internet more quickly. Her staff also deployed Google\u2019s machine-learning systems to flag extremist content.\nThese days, YouTube says it is pursuing what the company calls \u201cresponsible growth.\u201d When asked what that means, Ms. Wojcicki said an easy explanation was a challenge.\nTo boil it down: YouTube wants to remove the content that violates its policies more quickly and effectively; promote better, more authoritative material and limit the spread of videos that are potentially harmful but do not break the rules.\nMs. Wojcicki said the third category, so-called borderline content, has been the most challenging. Earlier this year, the company announced that it was changing its algorithm to stop recommending material like conspiracy videos that can become a gateway to the unsavory.\nStarting with the United States, YouTube said it would employ human raters from across the country to evaluate certain content. Those judgments will help inform what the recommendation engine flags. (Clearly, the algorithms need attention. This week, they mistakenly added information about the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to footage of the Notre Dame fire.) YouTube said it plans to introduce the change to another 20 countries this year, deploying raters in each market to understand the preferences of local users.\nWhen asked why she didn\u2019t act sooner, Ms. Wojcicki said she wished she had. \u201cIf I were to go back in time, I certainly would have accelerated all of these features, and I would have accelerated all of this work because now I\u2019ve realized how important it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized at the time, too. We always thought it was important, but I can\u2019t emphasize the number of people and systems that it is taking for us to implement it.\u201d\n\u2018Everybody is angry at you all the time\u2019\nAt the YouTube policy meeting I observed, Ms. Wojcicki asked 37 questions in one hour. They were short. And direct. In one exchange, a YouTube staffer (I agreed to not use their names) briefed her on an uptick in users uploading soft-core pornography.\nMs. Wojcicki: \u201cYou feel good about the changes we made, and that that group has been managed?\u201d\nStaffer: \u201cYes. I mean, they\u2019ll keep evolving.\u201d\nMs. Wojcicki: \u201cHow did we find it?\u201d\nThe staffer described an anomaly-detection system.\nMs. Wojcicki: \u201cAnd then you terminated those accounts?\u201d\nStaffer: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\nYouTube\u2019s mammoth video corpus and flow of new kinds of content present a challenge that simply never ends. Another test is always around the corner, whether it be the 2020 presidential elections or A.I.-generated \u201cdeepfake\u201d technology. In the meantime, it\u2019s hard to declare progress, much less victory, when the failures are so notable.\nMs. Wojcicki said that seeing harmful videos and the hateful behavior of people online is the worst part of her job. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not even rewarding, because everybody is angry at you all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s probably some of the most important work that I will do in my career, because it\u2019s setting a standard of responsibility for the internet.\u201d\nShe has become a pariah among a vocal minority of YouTube enthusiasts who think she has gone too far to alter what made YouTube popular in the first place. When Ms. Wojcicki started her own YouTube channel in fall 2017, her videos were overrun by negative comments, including anti-Semitic remarks and insults about her looks and manner of speaking. Her first post \u2014 a slick montage with YouTube stars offering advice on making videos \u2014 received five times as many thumbs-down votes as thumbs-up. When YouTube published a year-in-review compilation, which excluded reference to its troubles, it became the most disliked video in the site\u2019s history. Even Ms. Wojcicki\u2019s kids, she said, told her that it was \u201ccringey.\u201d\nThe growing backlash against YouTube has complicated some personal relationships. Marc Benioff, the chairman of Salesforce, said last year that social media was potentially as harmful as cigarettes and needed to be regulated. Ms. Wojcicki has been a Salesforce board director since 2014, and Mr. Benioff is a longtime acquaintance. For this article, YouTube arranged for an interview with Mr. Benioff to provide insight about her. But on the morning of a scheduled call, Mr. Benioff was feuding on Twitter with its C.E.O. about a proposed tax to pay for services for the homeless in San Francisco.\nHe joined the call 40 minutes late, saying he only had five minutes to spare. When I asked how Ms. Wojcicki reacted to his comments about social media, Mr. Benioff became upset. He said he wasn\u2019t \u201cprepared to answer\u201d the question and had expected to speak about her leadership style. Then he ended the call.\nIn a written statement sent a week later, Mr. Benioff said: \u201cWe\u2019re living in a crisis of trust, and as I\u2019ve said before that if our industry doesn\u2019t self-regulate, the government will do it for us. But I don\u2019t think that reality fazes someone like Susan because she knows, no matter what, the power of trust and transparency far outweighs whatever regulation that may come our way.\u201d\n\u2018She is not going anywhere\u2019\nThe easiest way to judge a C.E.O.\u2019s performance, of course, is to study their company\u2019s financial results. In the case of YouTube, that\u2019s a matter of guesswork. The company is a few layers deep within Alphabet and its financial results are not disclosed. YouTube reveals data points in drips and drabs, but the numbers are too absent of context to be of much use. On the last earnings call with analysts, for example, Google said that the number of YouTube channels with more than one million subscribers nearly doubled last year, and that the number of creators making more than $10,000 annually grew more than 40 percent. But investors do not know YouTube\u2019s profit or costs, or how Ms. Wojcicki has affected them over time.\nFrom what we can glean, though, YouTube\u2019s business appears to be thriving. Alphabet cited its \u201cstrong contribution\u201d as a key factor for the company\u2019s record profits in the fourth quarter. Analysts estimate that YouTube\u2019s annual revenue has surpassed $15 billion and is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year.\nIf building a business with Netflix-size revenue inside Alphabet wasn\u2019t enough to gain Ms. Wojcicki job security from YouTube\u2019s policing struggles, there\u2019s also the Larry factor. She technically reports to Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, but she answers to Mr. Page. She remains one of the few people at the company with \u201cwalk-in access\u201d to the reclusive co-founder, one Google executive told me. \u201cShe is not going anywhere,\u201d this person said.\nOne reason Ms. Wojcicki defies easy characterization is that her core function keeps changing. Today, her job is to be something like the standards czar of an anarchic civilization. Before that, when YouTube started home-growing celebrity icons, she was a budding media mogul. But in whatever role YouTube has needed her to assume, Ms. Wojcicki has not lost sight of the skill she learned early on at Google: how to keep advertisers happy.\nMarc S. Pritchard, Procter & Gamble\u2019s chief brand officer, who is responsible for one of the biggest advertising budgets in the world, said his company has had some rocky moments with YouTube in the last few years, and that Ms. Wojcicki has been a steadying presence.\nLike other major marketers, P.&G. stopped spending on YouTube in early 2017 when it found its advertisements running next to videos with violence, extreme language and other consumer-unfriendly qualities. When Mr. Pritchard called Ms. Wojcicki with the bad news, he said, the conversation was not contentious. She told him: \u201cYou\u2019re an important partner. We\u2019re going to work together to get this fixed.\u201d\nAlmost a year after P.&G. put its wallet away, the \u201cTide Pod challenge\u201d started to spread across YouTube. Tide is one of P.&G.\u2019s flagship brands, and Mr. Pritchard said that late one Friday night, Ms. Wojcicki called him with reassurances that her company was on top of the problem. She added a metaphor about the scale of the challenge: YouTube had started out as a small city, but it had grown into a metropolis.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve grown well beyond a metropolis,\u201d Mr. Pritchard recalled telling her. \u201cYou grew into a galaxy. That has implications beyond anything you would have ever known.\u201d Within a few hours, the worst Tide Pod videos were scrubbed from YouTube, and the platform changed its algorithm so anyone searching for them would be shown a safety video.\n\u201cNo debate, just action,\u201d said Mr. Pritchard. A few months later, P.&G. announced that it would resume advertising on YouTube.\nOver Presidents\u2019 Day weekend, Ms. Wojcicki was traveling with her family when another ad disaster struck. A YouTuber named Matt Watson posted a video with the title \u201cYouTube is Facilitating the Sexual Exploitation of Children, and It\u2019s Being Monetized.\u201d It demonstrated how pedophiles were coordinating their behavior on the site, including on some videos sponsored by big brands, and those companies started to pull their advertising.\nMs. Wojcicki asked her staff to do a \u201ccontent review\u201d to remove any problematic videos and comments. She coordinated with senior executives and the \u201cincident commander,\u201d a rotating position she had created to ensure that every \u201cescalation\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s corporate-speak for \u201ca terrible thing found on our platform\u201d \u2014 had a point person overseeing the response. Eventually, YouTube said it removed inappropriate comments from thousands of videos and would disable comments permanently on most content featuring children under 13.\nMs. Wojcicki said while the situation was regrettable, it also demonstrated that some of YouTube\u2019s new policies are helping. YouTube was able to turn off comments on millions of videos over a holiday weekend, something it would have struggled to do in the past.\nA month later, when YouTube\u2019s human reviewers were overwhelmed by a deluge of videos of the mass shooting in New Zealand \u2014 at one point, footage of the shooting was being uploaded every second \u2014 Ms. Wojcicki said the company intentionally disabled search functions. It also bypassed human reviewers and let its computers immediately take down any videos that were automatically flagged.\nShe said each horrible incident helps the company be better prepared for the next one. And there will always be a next one, as long as YouTube remains open to allowing anyone with an internet connection to upload a video.\nAfter a long conversation, Ms. Wojcicki became introspective. She said she joined Google because she wanted to do something meaningful with her life, and saw the company\u2019s mission of helping people find the right information as inspiring. But now she recognizes that her ultimate legacy will be whether YouTube can get a handle on its problems.\n\u201cI know we can do better, but we\u2019re going to get there. We\u2019ll get to a point where we have solved a lot of these issues, and I feel like we\u2019ve already made significant progress,\u201d she said. \u201cI own this problem, and I\u2019m going to fix it.\u201d",

And for decades the field suffered from neglect: low funding and a corresponding limited interest in academia.</p>\n<p>Then came a series of high-profile mass shootings. And donations from billionaires. A result has been a recent surge in state and private funding for gun research, and a revival in interest among journal editors and young academics beginning their careers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just the availability of money for research,&rdquo; said Jeremy Travis, the executive vice president for criminal justice at Arnold Ventures. &ldquo;The zeitgeist has changed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Last year, Arnold Ventures, a foundation established by John and Laura Arnold, announced a splashy investment: It would be spending $20 million to fund research grants in the field, administering the grants through the nonpartisan RAND Corporation. And Kaiser Permanente, the health care provider, has set aside $2 million for its own research program.</p>\n<p>Michael Bloomberg, the media executive and former New York mayor, has been spending on gun research for years. His sponsorship of endowed faculty positions at Johns Hopkins in the Center for Gun Policy and Research has helped several scholars.</p>\n<p>States have begun making investments in gun research, too. A $5 million investment from California has led to the formation of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. New Jersey&rsquo;s legislature approved $2 million to establish a center at Rutgers University. Several more states and the District of Columbia are considering similar programs.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;All these new people are coming,&rdquo; said Garen Wintemute, a professor who directs the program at Davis. &ldquo;It used to be a dozen people in the country &mdash; now there are a dozen people in my building.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Wintemute has made gun violence the central topic of his work. But for much of his career, funding was scarce, and he often dipped into his salary to subsidize the costs of his research. He said he expected the new investments to result in significant new advances; he described a big folder of study ideas in his office that might finally be realized.</p>\n<p>In Washington, research funding on this divisive topic remains anemic.<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2595514\"> A recent analysis found</a> that gun research receives substantially less funding from the federal government than research for other major causes of death &mdash; only 1.6 percent of the funding the researchers would have predicted based on spending on comparable health problems.</p>\n<p>Gun deaths, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/upshot/gun-deaths-are-mostly-suicides.html\">majority of which are from suicide</a>, are roughly the same in number as deaths from sepsis, for example. But federal research funding for gun violence is only about 0.7 percent of that for sepsis.</p>\n<p>Shani Buggs is part of the new generation of gun researchers. When she went to school for public health seven years ago, she didn&rsquo;t even know that violence was a subject she could pursue. She&rsquo;s now a postdoctoral fellow at the gun violence center at U.C. Davis, studying interactions between drug markets, policing and urban gun violence.</p>\n<p>Ms. Buggs said that the new money had not been her only motivator, but that it did make her feel more secure about her future. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s most exciting about it is that the increase in dollars will bring more researchers to the field.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In an Upshot <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/upshot/how-to-reduce-mass-shooting-deaths-experts-say-these-gun-laws-could-help.html\">survey</a> last year, researchers <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/02/upshot/what-should-government-study-gun-research-funding.html\">expressed interest</a> in knowing more about many subjects, including the factors that lead individuals to commit gun violence &mdash; Ms. Buggs&rsquo;s focus. They also sought research into how criminals obtain their guns and the effects of various gun policies, such as new state laws that allow courts to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/red-flag-laws-guns.html\">temporarily confiscate guns</a> from people who are deemed a risk to commit violence. Such legislation has passed in <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Extreme_risk_protection_orders_in_state_legislatures\">14 states</a> &mdash; 11 since 2016.</p>\n<p>Research publications on gun violence also appear to be rising, reflecting an enhanced interest by journal editors, not just scholars. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s new names on a lot of these publications,&rdquo; said Ted Alcorn, an instructor at Columbia whose analysis of gun-related science publications over the past few decades was published <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2582987\">in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>. His study found that gun research had declined as a share of science research since the mid-1990s, but that it began to rise sharply in 2012, the year of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.</p>\n<p>The C.D.C. effectively stopped funding original research on gun violence after the passage of legislation in 1996 (the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993413/\">Dickey Amendment</a>) that barred the use of C.D.C. funds to &ldquo;advocate or promote gun control.&rdquo; Republican legislators had objected to government-funded research concluding that having a gun in the home increased the risk of harm. But even before the Dickey amendment, the C.D.C. spent just $2.6 million a year on gun violence research. The National Institutes of Health <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2513131\">funds some gun-related research,</a> but not much.</p>\n<p>Many major players in the field continue to lobby for a larger federal role, despite the new infusions of outside funding. At a recent hearing before a House appropriation subcommittee, Andrew Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at RAND, said there were some research tasks, like collecting and disseminating national statistics on gun injuries, that required government involvement.</p>\n<p>He pointed to other public health crises &mdash; like car crashes, H.I.V. and cigarette smoking &mdash; in which research led the way to big reductions in mortality.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you think of firearms deaths along the lines of traffic crashes and smoking, you think about a really big project,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think of this as a large effort of a magnitude that only the federal government would be able to support.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel, via Associated Press\nIn 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped funding research into the causes of gun violence. And for decades the field suffered from neglect: low funding and a corresponding limited interest in academia.\nThen came a series of high-profile mass shootings. And donations from billionaires. A result has been a recent surge in state and private funding for gun research, and a revival in interest among journal editors and young academics beginning their careers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the availability of money for research,\u201d said Jeremy Travis, the executive vice president for criminal justice at Arnold Ventures. \u201cThe zeitgeist has changed.\u201d\nLast year, Arnold Ventures, a foundation established by John and Laura Arnold, announced a splashy investment: It would be spending $20 million to fund research grants in the field, administering the grants through the nonpartisan RAND Corporation. And Kaiser Permanente, the health care provider, has set aside $2 million for its own research program.\nMichael Bloomberg, the media executive and former New York mayor, has been spending on gun research for years. His sponsorship of endowed faculty positions at Johns Hopkins in the Center for Gun Policy and Research has helped several scholars.\nStates have begun making investments in gun research, too. A $5 million investment from California has led to the formation of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. New Jersey\u2019s legislature approved $2 million to establish a center at Rutgers University. Several more states and the District of Columbia are considering similar programs.\n\u201cAll these new people are coming,\u201d said Garen Wintemute, a professor who directs the program at Davis. \u201cIt used to be a dozen people in the country \u2014 now there are a dozen people in my building.\u201d\nMr. Wintemute has made gun violence the central topic of his work. But for much of his career, funding was scarce, and he often dipped into his salary to subsidize the costs of his research. He said he expected the new investments to result in significant new advances; he described a big folder of study ideas in his office that might finally be realized.\nIn Washington, research funding on this divisive topic remains anemic. A recent analysis found that gun research receives substantially less funding from the federal government than research for other major causes of death \u2014 only 1.6 percent of the funding the researchers would have predicted based on spending on comparable health problems.\nGun deaths, the majority of which are from suicide, are roughly the same in number as deaths from sepsis, for example. But federal research funding for gun violence is only about 0.7 percent of that for sepsis.\nShani Buggs is part of the new generation of gun researchers. When she went to school for public health seven years ago, she didn\u2019t even know that violence was a subject she could pursue. She\u2019s now a postdoctoral fellow at the gun violence center at U.C. Davis, studying interactions between drug markets, policing and urban gun violence.\nMs. Buggs said that the new money had not been her only motivator, but that it did make her feel more secure about her future. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s most exciting about it is that the increase in dollars will bring more researchers to the field.\u201d\nIn an Upshot survey last year, researchers expressed interest in knowing more about many subjects, including the factors that lead individuals to commit gun violence \u2014 Ms. Buggs\u2019s focus. They also sought research into how criminals obtain their guns and the effects of various gun policies, such as new state laws that allow courts to temporarily confiscate guns from people who are deemed a risk to commit violence. Such legislation has passed in 14 states \u2014 11 since 2016.\nResearch publications on gun violence also appear to be rising, reflecting an enhanced interest by journal editors, not just scholars. \u201cThere\u2019s new names on a lot of these publications,\u201d said Ted Alcorn, an instructor at Columbia whose analysis of gun-related science publications over the past few decades was published in JAMA Internal Medicine. His study found that gun research had declined as a share of science research since the mid-1990s, but that it began to rise sharply in 2012, the year of the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut.\nThe C.D.C. effectively stopped funding original research on gun violence after the passage of legislation in 1996 (the Dickey Amendment) that barred the use of C.D.C. funds to \u201cadvocate or promote gun control.\u201d Republican legislators had objected to government-funded research concluding that having a gun in the home increased the risk of harm. But even before the Dickey amendment, the C.D.C. spent just $2.6 million a year on gun violence research. The National Institutes of Health funds some gun-related research, but not much.\nMany major players in the field continue to lobby for a larger federal role, despite the new infusions of outside funding. At a recent hearing before a House appropriation subcommittee, Andrew Morral, a senior behavioral scientist at RAND, said there were some research tasks, like collecting and disseminating national statistics on gun injuries, that required government involvement.\nHe pointed to other public health crises \u2014 like car crashes, H.I.V. and cigarette smoking \u2014 in which research led the way to big reductions in mortality.\n\u201cIf you think of firearms deaths along the lines of traffic crashes and smoking, you think about a really big project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think of this as a large effort of a magnitude that only the federal government would be able to support.\u201d",

Once considered a rising star in the Democratic Party &mdash; he was the first Latino to give a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention &mdash; he has been outshined in the ever-expanding field by brighter stars and nonstars alike. While he has many fans in his hometown, San Antonio, where he once served as mayor, he is not well known on the national stage. And with the sudden rise of the former El Paso congressman <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/us/politics/beto-orourke-iowa-president.html\">Beto O&rsquo;Rourke</a>, Mr. Castro is not even the most well-known candidate in his own state.</p>\n<p>Still, during an interview at one of his favorite Tex-Mex restaurants, Mr. Castro seemed relatively unfazed, and maybe for good reason: At age 44, and as the only Latino candidate in the race, he would seem to satisfy the Democratic Party&rsquo;s desire for youth and diversity, to say nothing of strategists who view Hispanic turnout as an important factor in winning back the White House.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>Sign up for our politics newsletter</em></a><em> and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.</em>]</p>\n<p>A former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, he is the sole candidate with cabinet experience. And he is from a border state that Democrats hope they can one day flip into their column.</p>\n<p>Mr. Castro also seems well situated in another way: With President Trump eager to make <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/politics/trump-asylum-seekers-federal-judge.html\">his hard-line immigration stance</a> a central part of the 2020 campaign, Mr. Castro, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, has already made immigration his signature issue.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, he was the first candidate to introduce an immigration plan, with detailed proposals that included decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and establishing a &ldquo;21st-Century Marshall Plan&rdquo; to aid Central American countries that have a high number of migrants.</p>\n<p>Last week, with Mr. Trump swinging through Texas to talk up his anti-immigrant message, Mr. Castro held a rally of his own in San Antonio that was billed as an opportunity for the city, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanantoniocitytexas\">whose population</a> is more than 60 percent Hispanic, to voice its opposition.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the issue that the president has put front and center, so I wanted to put my own vision for immigration up against his,&rdquo; he said, hours before he told a crowd of several hundred that &ldquo;this is personal for me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It was Mr. Castro&rsquo;s boldest attempt yet to position himself as a formidable candidate and challenger to Mr. Trump, as images of migrants at the border &mdash; in whom he sees the face of his grandmother, he has said &mdash; continue to jolt many Americans.</p>\n<p>He seized on the issue again Tuesday night, denouncing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/barr-asylum-bail.html\">a move by the Justice Department</a> to deny some immigrants seeking asylum the chance to post bail. &ldquo;This administration&rsquo;s bottomless cruelty has failed time and time again,&rsquo;&rsquo; he wrote on Twitter.</p>\n<p>But if this should be a defining time for Mr. Castro, so far it is not.</p>\n<p>Though he has drawn some recent notice, including for being among the first of the candidates to support a congressional bill to study reparations, he is in many ways a 2020 afterthought: In <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/politics/iowa-democrats-poll-biden.html?searchResultPosition=3\">a Monmouth University poll</a> of Iowa Democrats conducted April 4-9, Mr. Castro came in ninth in a field of 24 announced and potential candidates, with 2 percent support.</p>\n<p>[<em>Who&rsquo;s in? Who&rsquo;s out? </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Some Democrats believe that Mr. Castro&rsquo;s moment has, if anything, already passed &mdash; that his best shot at national success occurred after he gave his electrifying speech at the 2012 convention. Some wonder whether he is too quiet, too inexperienced and too careful to compete in such a crowded, high-powered primary field.</p>\n<p>While Mr. Castro tries to brush off the inevitable comparisons to Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke, whose challenge to Senator Ted Cruz last year turned him into a national celebrity, the attention drawn by Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke &mdash; who speaks fluent Spanish, and whose hometown is on the border with Mexico &mdash; has cast something of a shadow over Mr. Castro&rsquo;s candidacy.</p>\n<p>When he left Washington at the end of the Obama administration, Mr. Castro returned to Texas but resisted entreaties to run for statewide office. He finished writing a book, did some teaching and spent time with his family, but some Texas Democrats believe he missed an opportunity to advance his career and gain the kind of political profile that could have fortified his presidential run.</p>\n<p>Because Mr. Castro never ran for statewide office, he has not built up a big email list of supporters, and he still has not met the 65,000-donor threshold to qualify for the first Democratic primary debates. In the first three months of the year, he raised only $1.1 million (though his campaign said it had raised over half a million more by mid-April).</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/campaign-finance-2020-fundraising.html\"><em>Here&rsquo;s a look at the early fund-raising numbers for the whole 2020 field.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that from the presidential perspective, it was a mistake,&rdquo; Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said about Mr. Castro&rsquo;s decision not to run statewide. &ldquo;But I do believe that, like Beto, had he run for one of those offices, that he would have done really well even if he wouldn&rsquo;t have won.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Castro is more circumspect, betting that voters will come to appreciate his background and executive experience, eventually.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People are going to have their moments,&rdquo; he said, without naming names but perhaps alluding to Pete Buttigieg, another 2020 candidate and the mayor of South Bend, Ind., whose popularity has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/buttigieg-2020-president.html\">grown substantially in the past month</a>. &ldquo;I would rather have my moment closer to the actual election than right now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He ticked off former Republican candidates who surged early, then flamed out, naming Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t just want two weeks in the sun.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Castro was born and raised in San Antonio. His grandmother emigrated from Mexico when she was seven. His mother, Rosie Castro, was a prominent civil rights activist in the 1970s.</p>\n<p>He went to Stanford, then Harvard Law School, and was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001, when he was 26. He ran for mayor of San Antonio in 2005 and lost. Four years later, he ran again and won.</p>\n<p>Allies of Mr. Castro praise him for implementing a full-day pre-K program when he was mayor that was funded by increasing the sales tax by an eighth of a cent. They also credit him with helping to revitalize parts of the city, including its downtown district.</p>\n<p>His keynote address at the 2012 convention immediately rocketed him into the national political conversation. When Mr. Obama approached him about serving in his cabinet, he demurred, saying he preferred to stay in San Antonio, but he relented in 2014 when he was asked again.</p>\n<p>Youthful and soft-spoken, with hair parted on the side, Mr. Castro describes himself as a progressive &mdash; he supports agenda items like &ldquo;Medicare for all&rdquo; and universal higher education &mdash; but is not blazingly so. Friends describe him as methodical and disciplined.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not his fallback position &mdash; to be this extrovert, light-up-any-room kind of guy,&rdquo; said Jaime Castillo, who worked for Mr. Castro both in the mayor&rsquo;s office and in Washington.</p>\n<p>Mr. Castro is also not his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a United States congressman, though it is hard to tell them apart. (Joaquin <a href=\"https://www.chron.com/news/bizarre/article/San-Antonio-candidate-s-twin-a-parade-stand-in-1953987.php\">once stood in</a> for Juli&aacute;n at a parade; it did not go over well.) Joaquin&rsquo;s name has recently been floated as a possible challenger to Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, a rumor Juli&aacute;n did not dispel.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They carry the hopes and dreams of the Latino community on their shoulders,&rdquo; said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who represented a district that stretches from San Antonio to El Paso.</p>\n<p>Even if Joaquin does not decide to run, Democrats across the country hope that Juli&aacute;n&rsquo;s presence in the race will inspire Hispanic voters, a group that the <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/\">Pew Research Center predicts</a> will be the biggest minority voting bloc in 2020.</p>\n<p>Mr. Castro hopes so, too, but he also does not want to be pigeonholed as a Latino candidate, and he has taken pains to try and appeal to a broad swath of voters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a significance there,&rdquo; Mr. Castro said about being the only Latino candidate for president. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not the totality of who I am or what I&rsquo;m pitching to America.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What he is pitching, in broad strokes, is that he is someone with a track record in public service who is &ldquo;trying to bring Americans together instead of tear them apart.&rdquo; And while some Democrats have suggested that Mr. Castro is in the presidential race simply to get on the ticket &mdash; Hillary Clinton had strongly considered him as a possible running mate in 2016 &mdash; it is a notion he dismisses outright. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m running for president,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>If Mr. Castro is the nominee, he believes that he would carry Texas, Arizona and Florida.</p>\n<p>At his anti-Trump rally last week, however, some voters in the modest crowd expressed skepticism that Mr. Castro could break through nationally.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not too sure he has that in him,&rdquo; said Samantha Mata, 22, who was born and raised in San Antonio. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hope that he could get that light.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Later that night, Mr. Castro sat at an outside table at a restaurant nearby. As he ate, the local news began showing clips from his rally.</p>\n<p>For a moment, before other diners realized the man on TV was in their midst, he looked up and caught a glimpse of himself.</p>",

                "text": "Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times\nSAN ANTONIO \u2014 Juli\u00e1n Castro, in a baseball cap and zip-up hoodie, sipped an iced tea and considered how he could win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\u201cIf everybody would just get out of the way,\u201d he said on a recent afternoon, \u201cI\u2019d have a clear path.\u201d\nHe was only half-kidding.\nMr. Castro is in need of a breakthrough moment. Once considered a rising star in the Democratic Party \u2014 he was the first Latino to give a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 he has been outshined in the ever-expanding field by brighter stars and nonstars alike. While he has many fans in his hometown, San Antonio, where he once served as mayor, he is not well known on the national stage. And with the sudden rise of the former El Paso congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke, Mr. Castro is not even the most well-known candidate in his own state.\nStill, during an interview at one of his favorite Tex-Mex restaurants, Mr. Castro seemed relatively unfazed, and maybe for good reason: At age 44, and as the only Latino candidate in the race, he would seem to satisfy the Democratic Party\u2019s desire for youth and diversity, to say nothing of strategists who view Hispanic turnout as an important factor in winning back the White House.\n[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]\nA former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, he is the sole candidate with cabinet experience. And he is from a border state that Democrats hope they can one day flip into their column.\nMr. Castro also seems well situated in another way: With President Trump eager to make his hard-line immigration stance a central part of the 2020 campaign, Mr. Castro, the grandson of a Mexican immigrant, has already made immigration his signature issue.\nEarlier this month, he was the first candidate to introduce an immigration plan, with detailed proposals that included decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and establishing a \u201c21st-Century Marshall Plan\u201d to aid Central American countries that have a high number of migrants.\nLast week, with Mr. Trump swinging through Texas to talk up his anti-immigrant message, Mr. Castro held a rally of his own in San Antonio that was billed as an opportunity for the city, whose population is more than 60 percent Hispanic, to voice its opposition.\n\u201cThis is the issue that the president has put front and center, so I wanted to put my own vision for immigration up against his,\u201d he said, hours before he told a crowd of several hundred that \u201cthis is personal for me.\u201d\nIt was Mr. Castro\u2019s boldest attempt yet to position himself as a formidable candidate and challenger to Mr. Trump, as images of migrants at the border \u2014 in whom he sees the face of his grandmother, he has said \u2014 continue to jolt many Americans.\nHe seized on the issue again Tuesday night, denouncing a move by the Justice Department to deny some immigrants seeking asylum the chance to post bail. \u201cThis administration\u2019s bottomless cruelty has failed time and time again,\u2019\u2019 he wrote on Twitter.\nBut if this should be a defining time for Mr. Castro, so far it is not.\nThough he has drawn some recent notice, including for being among the first of the candidates to support a congressional bill to study reparations, he is in many ways a 2020 afterthought: In a Monmouth University poll of Iowa Democrats conducted April 4-9, Mr. Castro came in ninth in a field of 24 announced and potential candidates, with 2 percent support.\n[Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.]\nSome Democrats believe that Mr. Castro\u2019s moment has, if anything, already passed \u2014 that his best shot at national success occurred after he gave his electrifying speech at the 2012 convention. Some wonder whether he is too quiet, too inexperienced and too careful to compete in such a crowded, high-powered primary field.\nWhile Mr. Castro tries to brush off the inevitable comparisons to Mr. O\u2019Rourke, whose challenge to Senator Ted Cruz last year turned him into a national celebrity, the attention drawn by Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 who speaks fluent Spanish, and whose hometown is on the border with Mexico \u2014 has cast something of a shadow over Mr. Castro\u2019s candidacy.\nWhen he left Washington at the end of the Obama administration, Mr. Castro returned to Texas but resisted entreaties to run for statewide office. He finished writing a book, did some teaching and spent time with his family, but some Texas Democrats believe he missed an opportunity to advance his career and gain the kind of political profile that could have fortified his presidential run.\nBecause Mr. Castro never ran for statewide office, he has not built up a big email list of supporters, and he still has not met the 65,000-donor threshold to qualify for the first Democratic primary debates. In the first three months of the year, he raised only $1.1 million (though his campaign said it had raised over half a million more by mid-April).\n[Here\u2019s a look at the early fund-raising numbers for the whole 2020 field.]\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that from the presidential perspective, it was a mistake,\u201d Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said about Mr. Castro\u2019s decision not to run statewide. \u201cBut I do believe that, like Beto, had he run for one of those offices, that he would have done really well even if he wouldn\u2019t have won.\u201d\nMr. Castro is more circumspect, betting that voters will come to appreciate his background and executive experience, eventually.\n\u201cPeople are going to have their moments,\u201d he said, without naming names but perhaps alluding to Pete Buttigieg, another 2020 candidate and the mayor of South Bend, Ind., whose popularity has grown substantially in the past month. \u201cI would rather have my moment closer to the actual election than right now.\u201d\nHe ticked off former Republican candidates who surged early, then flamed out, naming Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll come,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t just want two weeks in the sun.\u201d\nMr. Castro was born and raised in San Antonio. His grandmother emigrated from Mexico when she was seven. His mother, Rosie Castro, was a prominent civil rights activist in the 1970s.\nHe went to Stanford, then Harvard Law School, and was elected to the San Antonio City Council in 2001, when he was 26. He ran for mayor of San Antonio in 2005 and lost. Four years later, he ran again and won.\nAllies of Mr. Castro praise him for implementing a full-day pre-K program when he was mayor that was funded by increasing the sales tax by an eighth of a cent. They also credit him with helping to revitalize parts of the city, including its downtown district.\nHis keynote address at the 2012 convention immediately rocketed him into the national political conversation. When Mr. Obama approached him about serving in his cabinet, he demurred, saying he preferred to stay in San Antonio, but he relented in 2014 when he was asked again.\nYouthful and soft-spoken, with hair parted on the side, Mr. Castro describes himself as a progressive \u2014 he supports agenda items like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and universal higher education \u2014 but is not blazingly so. Friends describe him as methodical and disciplined.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not his fallback position \u2014 to be this extrovert, light-up-any-room kind of guy,\u201d said Jaime Castillo, who worked for Mr. Castro both in the mayor\u2019s office and in Washington.\nMr. Castro is also not his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a United States congressman, though it is hard to tell them apart. (Joaquin once stood in for Juli\u00e1n at a parade; it did not go over well.) Joaquin\u2019s name has recently been floated as a possible challenger to Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, a rumor Juli\u00e1n did not dispel.\n\u201cThey carry the hopes and dreams of the Latino community on their shoulders,\u201d said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who represented a district that stretches from San Antonio to El Paso.\nEven if Joaquin does not decide to run, Democrats across the country hope that Juli\u00e1n\u2019s presence in the race will inspire Hispanic voters, a group that the Pew Research Center predicts will be the biggest minority voting bloc in 2020.\nMr. Castro hopes so, too, but he also does not want to be pigeonholed as a Latino candidate, and he has taken pains to try and appeal to a broad swath of voters.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significance there,\u201d Mr. Castro said about being the only Latino candidate for president. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the totality of who I am or what I\u2019m pitching to America.\u201d\nWhat he is pitching, in broad strokes, is that he is someone with a track record in public service who is \u201ctrying to bring Americans together instead of tear them apart.\u201d And while some Democrats have suggested that Mr. Castro is in the presidential race simply to get on the ticket \u2014 Hillary Clinton had strongly considered him as a possible running mate in 2016 \u2014 it is a notion he dismisses outright. \u201cI\u2019m running for president,\u201d he said.\nIf Mr. Castro is the nominee, he believes that he would carry Texas, Arizona and Florida.\nAt his anti-Trump rally last week, however, some voters in the modest crowd expressed skepticism that Mr. Castro could break through nationally.\n\u201cI\u2019m not too sure he has that in him,\u201d said Samantha Mata, 22, who was born and raised in San Antonio. \u201cI\u2019d like to hope that he could get that light.\u201d\nLater that night, Mr. Castro sat at an outside table at a restaurant nearby. As he ate, the local news began showing clips from his rally.\nFor a moment, before other diners realized the man on TV was in their midst, he looked up and caught a glimpse of himself.",

Kirkpatrick for The New York Times</p>\n<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; A strange dynamic has gripped the Federal Trade Commission: President Trump&rsquo;s biggest allies are the Democrats.</p>\n<p>In a vote made public Wednesday, the commission&rsquo;s two Democratic appointees voted to impose financial penalties on companies the agency found violated federal law by falsely marketing their products as &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; when, in fact, most of their merchandise was manufactured in China.</p>\n<p>But the three Republican commissioners &mdash; all appointed by Mr. Trump &mdash; overruled them and voted against imposing any fines or penalties at all. They said the companies should not be required to admit any wrongdoing or notify customers of their false marketing, arguing that the threat of future penalties served as a strong enough deterrent to prevent a repeat offense.</p>\n<p>The vote, which took place on Tuesday, broke along party lines &mdash; just not necessarily the expected ones.</p>\n<p>Since the 2016 election, Mr. Trump has promoted himself as the man who will resuscitate American manufacturing and jobs. In April 2017, he signed a &ldquo;Buy American and Hire American&rdquo; executive order, with the goal of promoting American-made goods &ldquo;to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But on the F.T.C., Mr. Trump&rsquo;s own appointees appeared to be out of step with the trade policy espoused by the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Republican commissioners didn&rsquo;t get the memo from President Trump about the &lsquo;Buy America, Hire America&rsquo; administration,&rdquo; said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.</p>\n<p>White House officials declined to comment.</p>\n<p>The case at hand involves three <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/us/politics/made-in-the-usa-ftc.html\">companies that the trade commission found violated the law</a>. One was a New Jersey-based hockey puck manufacturer, Patriot Puck, which wrapped its China-made hockey pucks in American flags and falsely declared them &ldquo;The Only American Made Hockey Puck!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Two more companies, Sandpiper and PiperGear, manufacturers of deployment bags and tactical gear, marketed their wears to active and retired American military personnel, branded themselves online as #MadeInUSA, and put &ldquo;American Made&rdquo; tags in some of their products.

                "text": "T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A strange dynamic has gripped the Federal Trade Commission: President Trump\u2019s biggest allies are the Democrats.\nIn a vote made public Wednesday, the commission\u2019s two Democratic appointees voted to impose financial penalties on companies the agency found violated federal law by falsely marketing their products as \u201cMade in America\u201d when, in fact, most of their merchandise was manufactured in China.\nBut the three Republican commissioners \u2014 all appointed by Mr. Trump \u2014 overruled them and voted against imposing any fines or penalties at all. They said the companies should not be required to admit any wrongdoing or notify customers of their false marketing, arguing that the threat of future penalties served as a strong enough deterrent to prevent a repeat offense.\nThe vote, which took place on Tuesday, broke along party lines \u2014 just not necessarily the expected ones.\nSince the 2016 election, Mr. Trump has promoted himself as the man who will resuscitate American manufacturing and jobs. In April 2017, he signed a \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order, with the goal of promoting American-made goods \u201cto ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.\u201d\nBut on the F.T.C., Mr. Trump\u2019s own appointees appeared to be out of step with the trade policy espoused by the president.\n\u201cThe Republican commissioners didn\u2019t get the memo from President Trump about the \u2018Buy America, Hire America\u2019 administration,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group.\nWhite House officials declined to comment.\nThe case at hand involves three companies that the trade commission found violated the law. One was a New Jersey-based hockey puck manufacturer, Patriot Puck, which wrapped its China-made hockey pucks in American flags and falsely declared them \u201cThe Only American Made Hockey Puck!\u201d\nTwo more companies, Sandpiper and PiperGear, manufacturers of deployment bags and tactical gear, marketed their wears to active and retired American military personnel, branded themselves online as #MadeInUSA, and put \u201cAmerican Made\u201d tags in some of their products. In reality, most of those goods were also manufactured in China, according to the commission.\nMr. Trump\u2019s handpicked chairman of the commission, Joseph J. Simons, defended the decision not to impose penalties on the companies. In a statement, Mr. Simons said \u201cthe threat of significant penalties\u201d going forward had \u201cbeen largely successful in keeping companies under order from making deceptive \u2018Made in U.S.A.\u2019 claims.\u201d He argued that the decision was consistent with how the commission had dealt with similar cases in the past, and said it was a \u201cstrategic choice\u201d to use the commission\u2019s \u201climited resources\u201d simply to make sure the companies did not break the law in the future.\nBut on Wednesday, one of the Democratic commissioners who had previously sided with Mr. Simons changed her position. \u201cI am persuaded that we should seek disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and an admission of liability in these cases,\u201d Rebecca Kelly Slaughter wrote in a dissenting statement. \u201cAnd I understand that, if the companies refuse to agree to such terms, we would have to expend substantial resources for, and take on the risk associated with, litigation.\u201d\nThe more stringent penalties, Ms. Slaughter said, \u201cwould send an unmistakable message that there will be meaningful consequences for brazenly mislabeling wholly imported products as American-made \u2014 even the first time that a fraudster gets caught.\u201d\nThe agency\u2019s other Democratic commissioner, Rohit Chopra, is taking the crusade against violators a step further, attempting to change the agency\u2019s entire approach to handling \u201cMade in America\u201d violations.\nMr. Chopra, in a dissenting statement, argued that the F.T.C. was given the authority to activate steep penalties on first-time violators since the North American Free Trade Agreement was passed in 1994 but has simply never used it. Mr. Chopra said he wanted the trade commission to activate a legal switch to \u201cturn on\u201d penalties that would make violators pay $42,530 in fines per violation, starting on the first offense.\nIn many cases over the past two decades, settlements with companies that violated \u201cMade in America\u201d rules were subject only to record-keeping and reporting requirements to make sure they did not violate the law again.\n\u201cWe cannot effectively protect honest businesses and promote fair competition if there are no consequences for violating the law,\u201d Mr. Chopra said in his dissenting opinion. \u201cGiven troubling trends in today\u2019s economy, I intend to make a motion to pursue a Made in U.S.A. rule that would allow the commission to seek meaningful penalties against those that harm law-abiding companies that make goods in America.\u201d",
