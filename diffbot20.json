Kate McCue. The announcement continues, like the woman who makes it, friendly and lighthearted, but also sharp and direct.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t have a tendency to call men captains by their first name,&rdquo; Captain McCue said on a recent phone call from her home in Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>Captain McCue became the first American woman to captain a cruise ship in 2015, and commands the Celebrity Equinox &mdash; a 122,000-ton, 1041-foot ship in the Celebrity Cruises fleet. Starting in September she will be at the helm of the <a href=\"https://www.celebritycruises.com/edge/\">Celebrity Edge</a>, a billion-dollar ship that was designed by women and overseen by Lisa Lutoff-Perlo, Celebrity Cruises&rsquo; chief executive.</p>\n<h2>What sparked your interest in sailing?</h2>\n<p>My interest in sailing started when I was 12. I went on a four-day cruise with my parents and brother over Thanksgiving. When we got back, I told my dad that I was going to work on cruise ships. I wanted to be the cruise director. My dad said I could be a cruise director or a captain or whatever I wanted.</p>\n<h2>Do you have to join the Navy to become a captain?</h2>\n<p>It depends on the country you come from. Being American, I could have gone through an academy, which is what I did, or I could have started sailing without a license and then put in the time at sea and taken the exams when I could. The academy was a lot more organized and structured with schooling and exams as part of the curriculum. I also could have gone the military route and joined the Navy.</p>\n<h2>Can you walk me through the process of how you became a captain?</h2>\n<p>As a cadet I worked on banana boats, taking boats between California and Ecuador. I was unhappy doing [this] because I knew I wanted to be on a cruise ship. I applied to every cruise ship and didn&rsquo;t hear back from anyone. I ended up applying to Disney as a bartender and was too qualified for that, probably because I had never been a bartender before, so they passed my C.V. along and I was hired as a third mate on a Disney cruise. That was great, but Disney only had two ships and not much room for growth. From 2003 to 2015 I worked my way up, from the entry level position of second officer, progressing through first officer deck, first officer navigation, first officer safety, chief officer safety and staff captain.</p>\n<h2>What challenges did you encounter on the path to getting where you are now?</h2>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t have war stories. I know that&rsquo;s not the case for everyone, but I&rsquo;ve been really blessed in my career. I have only worked on international flagships where everyone is a minority of some sort. Most of us have a different religion, sexual orientation, nationality. When I was promoted I never got negative judgment from the crew, and I think the secret is that I was always surrounded by diversity.</p>\n<h2>Is being a captain in 2018 and 2019 very different than it was, say a decade ago? </h2>\n<p>There used to be the wrath of the captain. Those captains were older, stricter men and they ran the ships very differently. I&rsquo;m part of a generation called the new age captains. We&rsquo;re in our late 30s and early 40s. There&rsquo;s an interesting gap between the captains who are retiring and the younger people replacing them. I love my job so much I&rsquo;m not going anywhere for another 40 years, God willing.</p>\n<h2>Why did you want to be involved with the Celebrity Edge?</h2>\n<p>I wanted to be part of Edge because since joining Celebrity Cruises in 2015, I&rsquo;d heard about this incredible ship that will change the way we see cruising and evolve the industry. I love change and wanted to be part of a something that was bringing such innovation and a new level to the cruising industry. Everything about this ship is revolutionary. It is the first ship to be designed using a 3-D virtual-reality lab.</p>\n<h2>Is there a big wheel on the ship like you see in the movies?</h2>\n<p>The &ldquo;Christopher Columbus&rdquo; dial is no longer. People expect to see that, but on new ships what you see is a wheel smaller than the wheel in your car. On one ship we brought the big wheel from a show and would have people and have them steer. It was a fantastic prop.</p>\n<h2>Does your cat, Bug Naked, come aboard?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bugnaked/?hl=en\">Bug Naked</a> comes when I&rsquo;m the captain, not when I&rsquo;m a guest on a trip. She&rsquo;s got her routine on the ship and I&rsquo;ve got mine. The guests love having her.</p>\n<p>This interview took place in December, following the Edge&rsquo;s first trip with passengers.

Europe is willing to constrain potentially harmful corporate behavior on a precautionary basis, while the United States requires stronger evidence of danger.</p>\n<p>The difference was on display this week as the European Union moved more quickly than the United States to ground a popular airplane, the Boeing 737 Max 8, after a pair of fatal crashes.</p>\n<p>The European Union Aviation Safety Agency acted Tuesday &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.easa.europa.eu/newsroom-and-events/news/easa-suspends-all-boeing-737-max-operations-europe\">as a precautionary measure</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Britain, which acted separately, and slightly before the Pan-European regulator, offered an even more explicit account of its reasoning, explaining that it was grounding the Boeing planes <a href=\"https://www.caa.co.uk/News/Boeing-737-MAX-Aircraft/\">because authorities did not know the cause of the most recent crash</a>, of an Ethiopian Airlines plane on Sunday.</p>\n<p>The Federal Aviation Administration, by contrast, said until Wednesday that the absence of information was the reason it was letting domestic airlines keep the planes in the air.</p>\n<p>And on Wednesday, when the F.A.A. joined other nations in grounding the planes, the agency insisted that it was acting <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=93206\">because it had obtained new evidence</a>. Daniel Elwell, the agency&rsquo;s acting administrator, defended the pace of its decision-making, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/03/14/703298739/faa-acting-head-dan-elwell-on-boeing-decision\">telling NPR on Thursday</a>, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a data-driven organization. &hellip; We make safety decisions based on what we know.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There were no crashes between the two decisions, but the difference remains significant. Both regulators had the same information in hand and, for roughly 24 hours, the F.A.A. decided to subject American airline employees and passengers to a greater degree of risk.</p>\n<p>The difference in risk tolerance is only part of the story. The Trump administration has openly discouraged the enforcement of a wide range of existing federal regulations. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-737-max-the-latest-example-of-a-passive-dot-11552409944\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> the total value of fines imposed on commercial airlines by the F.A.A. in 2018 was 88 percent lower than the total value of fines in 2016. The White House last year proposed to reduce funding and staffing for the F.A.A.&rsquo;s Aviation Safety Office.</p>\n<p>Also, nations often are more reluctant to crack down on domestic companies. Mr. Elwell has insisted that the F.A.A. made its decisions solely on the basis of safety. But if safety was the only consideration, then any risk would have warranted action. The F.A.A. is necessarily in the business of balancing the economic benefits of aviation against the safety of passengers. And the economic benefits include Boeing&rsquo;s role as a major employer and exporter.</p>\n<p>But the calibration of regulation still plays an important role.</p>\n<p>The 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which started the project of creating a single set of European regulations, enshrined a &ldquo;precautionary principle,&rdquo; meaning that government can impose restrictions even when there is not clear evidence of harm. &ldquo;Those in public office have a duty not to wait until their worst fears are realized,&rdquo; Robert Coleman, then the European Commission&rsquo;s director general for health and consumer protection, said in 2002.</p>\n<p>The United States, meanwhile, has moved in the other direction. &ldquo;As European policymakers have grown more willing to regulate risks on precautionary grounds, increasingly skeptical American policymakers have called for higher levels of scientific certainty before imposing additional regulatory controls on business,&rdquo; David Vogel, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in a 2012 book on the divide, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9752.html\">The Politics of Precaution</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>European nations initially lagged behind the United States in protecting the health and safety of their citizens, which created a popular backlash that gained strength after a series of disasters, including the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. The political environment also has been more supportive in Europe. Right-wing parties in Europe generally are neither as skeptical of science nor as devoted to business as the Republican Party in the United States can be.</p>\n<p>The consequences are wide-ranging. In 2010, for example, the European Union banned bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical used in the formulation of hard, clear plastics, from plastic baby bottles. John Dalli, then the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, cited &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo; about the health effects of ingesting BPA by way of explanation.</p>\n<p>The United States Food and Drug Administration insisted there was no evidence of danger. It did not remove the chemical from its list of approved substances in baby bottles <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/science/fda-bans-bpa-from-baby-bottles-and-sippy-cups.html\">until after</a> manufacturers of baby bottles, concerned about a consumer backlash, stopped using BPA voluntarily.</p>\n<p>Other recent examples of Europe&rsquo;s more aggressive approach include a ban on the use of pesticides that appeared to be killing bees, prohibitions on the inclusion of some antibiotics in animal feed and restrictions on waste incinerators.</p>\n<p>Precautionary regulation imposes real economic costs. In some cases, the more permissive stance of the United States may well be justified. The case of the Boeing 737 Max 8, however, should not have been a close call. Though the risk of another crash was unknown, the F.A.A. should have recognized that the potential for another loss of human life was an unbearable expense. The rapidity of the agency&rsquo;s reversal &mdash; while information about the Ethiopia crash was still quite limited &mdash; suggests in this case, at least, that regulators accepted the wisdom of a little more caution.</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

And the economic benefits include Boeing\u2019s role as a major employer and exporter.\nBut the calibration of regulation still plays an important role.\nThe 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which started the project of creating a single set of European regulations, enshrined a \u201cprecautionary principle,\u201d meaning that government can impose restrictions even when there is not clear evidence of harm. \u201cThose in public office have a duty not to wait until their worst fears are realized,\u201d Robert Coleman, then the European Commission\u2019s director general for health and consumer protection, said in 2002.\nThe United States, meanwhile, has moved in the other direction. \u201cAs European policymakers have grown more willing to regulate risks on precautionary grounds, increasingly skeptical American policymakers have called for higher levels of scientific certainty before imposing additional regulatory controls on business,\u201d David Vogel, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in a 2012 book on the divide, \u201cThe Politics of Precaution.\u201d\nEuropean nations initially lagged behind the United States in protecting the health and safety of their citizens, which created a popular backlash that gained strength after a series of disasters, including the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in 1986. The political environment also has been more supportive in Europe. Right-wing parties in Europe generally are neither as skeptical of science nor as devoted to business as the Republican Party in the United States can be.\nThe consequences are wide-ranging. In 2010, for example, the European Union banned bisphenol-A (BPA), a chemical used in the formulation of hard, clear plastics, from plastic baby bottles. John Dalli, then the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, cited \u201cuncertainty\u201d about the health effects of ingesting BPA by way of explanation.\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration insisted there was no evidence of danger. It did not remove the chemical from its list of approved substances in baby bottles until after manufacturers of baby bottles, concerned about a consumer backlash, stopped using BPA voluntarily.\nOther recent examples of Europe\u2019s more aggressive approach include a ban on the use of pesticides that appeared to be killing bees, prohibitions on the inclusion of some antibiotics in animal feed and restrictions on waste incinerators.\nPrecautionary regulation imposes real economic costs. In some cases, the more permissive stance of the United States may well be justified. The case of the Boeing 737 Max 8, however, should not have been a close call. Though the risk of another crash was unknown, the F.A.A. should have recognized that the potential for another loss of human life was an unbearable expense. The rapidity of the agency\u2019s reversal \u2014 while information about the Ethiopia crash was still quite limited \u2014 suggests in this case, at least, that regulators accepted the wisdom of a little more caution.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

In both cases, judges have rejected the argument that the presidency insulates Mr. Trump from the reach of state courts hearing cases unrelated to his official duties.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said they would appeal the ruling in the Zervos matter.\nIf past is prologue, these lawsuits could be a minefield for Mr. Trump, who so far has avoided, on his lawyers\u2019 advice, a face-to-face interview with the special counsel, Robert Mueller \u2014 in no small part because of the president\u2019s tenuous relationship with the truth.\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled for Ms. Jones in 1997, President Clinton, like a regular citizen, was questioned under oath by her lawyers, and in the process denied that he had ever had a sexual encounter with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. The rest, as they say, is history.\nGeorge Conway, husband of the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, played a not insignificant role, both publicly and behind the scenes, in getting the public and the justice system to accept the premise that Mr. Clinton \u2014 or any other president, for that matter \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be beyond the reach of the courts. Mr. Conway, who was one of the lawyers who represented Ms. Jones in her suit against the president, was among a cadre of conservatives who used a variety of means \u2014 including the courts \u2014 to hound the Clintons. He was part of what Hillary Clinton termed at the time a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d\nOn Thursday, after learning of the New York ruling, Mr. Conway took a victory lap of sorts. He shared on Twitter a Supreme Court brief he helped ghostwrite in the Jones case. \u201cI stand by these arguments, as applied to any president, of any party,\u201d he wrote.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

As far back as 2008, health officials had advised the state to implement needle exchange programs in light of growing injection drug use. Those calls went unheeded. By 2011, it was clear that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/us/rural-indiana-struggles-to-contend-with-hiv-outbreak.html\">an H.I.V. outbreak</a> was brewing in the region, but elected officials did not change course. Nor did they take other basic steps &mdash; like expanding access to evidence-based treatment programs for opioid use disorder, or increasing government funding for H.I.V. testing &mdash; that might have brought the problem under control.</p>\n<p>Then, in 2013, state budget cuts forced the region&rsquo;s lone H.I.V. testing provider (a Planned Parenthood clinic) to close its doors.</p>\n<p>By early 2015, scores of residents were newly infected with the virus, and even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/08/us/politics/mike-pence-needle-exchanges-indiana.html\">the local sheriff</a> was pushing the state to lift its ban on needle exchange programs. Mike Pence, then Indiana&rsquo;s governor, balked. Despite scientific consensus to the contrary, Mr. Pence worried that such a program would only encourage more injection drug use.</p>\n<p>By the time the governor finally relented, federal health officials were estimating that more than 100 people in Scott County had already been infected with the virus. Mr. Pence&rsquo;s response was tepid: He signed a bill <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/us/indiana-declares-health-emergency-after-hiv-outbreak.html?_r=0\">temporarily allowing needle exchanges</a> in the outbreak&rsquo;s epicenter, but he provided no state funding for that program and made the requirements for participation strict and burdensome. For good measure, he also upgraded needle possession without a prescription from a misdemeanor to a felony.</p>\n<p>According to a study published in September in the scientific journal <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(18)30176-0/fulltext\">The </a><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(18)30176-0/fulltext\">Lancet </a><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(18)30176-0/fulltext\">H.I.V.</a>, nearly all of the 215 H.I.V. infections that resulted from the outbreak could have been prevented &mdash; if the state&rsquo;s elected officials had more quickly heeded the advice of public health experts.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pence&rsquo;s slow, own-foot-shooting response to the H.I.V. crisis in his home state bears many lessons for his current boss, President Trump, who recently announced a plan to eradicate H.I.V. in the United States by 2030.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s plan has some promising features. Developed by career civil servants with decades of experience combating H.I.V., it would provide the first new funding for the domestic fight against this disease in many years. And it would deploy a majority of those dollars to communities where the virus is most prevalent and resources most urgently needed.</p>\n<p>But as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/health/trump-hiv-aids-costs.html\">The Times</a> reported this week, the president&rsquo;s proposed budget for the initiative &mdash; $291 million for the first year &mdash; falls far short of what&rsquo;s needed to reach the stated goal. And like Mr. Pence&rsquo;s efforts in Indiana, many of the Trump administration&rsquo;s other policies stand to undermine this initiative.</p>\n<p>Roughly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/statistics.html\">one million</a> Americans live with H.I.V. today; one million more are at risk of contracting it. A vast majority of those who are infected live in marginalized communities, and 15 percent of them have not been diagnosed. Conquering the disease will require making health care as widely accessible as possible. But the same budget proposal that would offer new money for fighting H.I.V. seeks to cut funds for Medicaid, a program that health officials say is a bedrock for people living with the virus. (It&rsquo;s no surprise that the region of the country with the highest <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/geographicdistribution.html\">H.I.V.</a> burden &mdash; the South &mdash; also has the lowest participation in <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/\">Medicaid expansion</a> under the Affordable Care Act.)</p>\n<p>Stopping the infection from spreading &mdash; as it still does to some 40,000 previously uninfected Americans each year &mdash; will require evidence-based sex education and a large, concerted effort to test everyone who is at risk of contracting the virus. But the administration has worked aggressively to undermine <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/health/trump-defunds-planned-parenthood.html\">Planned Parenthood</a>, one of the few organizations to provide easily accessible H.I.V. testing in low-income communities around the country. And the Department of Health and Human Services has pushed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/health/trump-teen-pregnancy-abstinence.html\">abstinence-only</a> programs that experts say severely undermine disease-prevention efforts.</p>\n<p>Nudging those who are infected into treatment, and helping them stay the course, will require active campaigns to help remove the stigma, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/magazine/americas-hidden-hiv-epidemic.html\">shame and fear</a> of a diagnosis. Instead, the Trump administration has repeatedly supported or enacted policies that result in further marginalization of L.G.B.T.Q. communities, which still suffer a disproportionate burden of H.I.V. infection.</p>\n<p>To eliminate H.I.V., the cost of medications capable of treating and preventing the disease will have to be sharply reduced (they currently cost tens of thousands of dollars a year per person). But so far, the administration has shown no appetite for using existing laws to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/opinion/prescription-drug-costs-naloxone-opioids.html\">override the patents</a> of these drugs and produce them at cost &mdash; a move that may offer the best chance of getting these lifesaving medications to the two million or so people who need them.</p>\n<p>More than two decades have passed since scientists first developed these medications. The latest plan might enable the United States to finally realize their full potential, but only if elected officials resolve the incongruities in their own policies.</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

Mr. Pence\u2019s response was tepid: He signed a bill temporarily allowing needle exchanges in the outbreak\u2019s epicenter, but he provided no state funding for that program and made the requirements for participation strict and burdensome. For good measure, he also upgraded needle possession without a prescription from a misdemeanor to a felony.\nAccording to a study published in September in the scientific journal The Lancet H.I.V., nearly all of the 215 H.I.V. infections that resulted from the outbreak could have been prevented \u2014 if the state\u2019s elected officials had more quickly heeded the advice of public health experts.\nMr. Pence\u2019s slow, own-foot-shooting response to the H.I.V. crisis in his home state bears many lessons for his current boss, President Trump, who recently announced a plan to eradicate H.I.V. in the United States by 2030.\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan has some promising features. Developed by career civil servants with decades of experience combating H.I.V., it would provide the first new funding for the domestic fight against this disease in many years. And it would deploy a majority of those dollars to communities where the virus is most prevalent and resources most urgently needed.\nBut as The Times reported this week, the president\u2019s proposed budget for the initiative \u2014 $291 million for the first year \u2014 falls far short of what\u2019s needed to reach the stated goal. And like Mr. Pence\u2019s efforts in Indiana, many of the Trump administration\u2019s other policies stand to undermine this initiative.\nRoughly one million Americans live with H.I.V. today; one million more are at risk of contracting it. A vast majority of those who are infected live in marginalized communities, and 15 percent of them have not been diagnosed. Conquering the disease will require making health care as widely accessible as possible. But the same budget proposal that would offer new money for fighting H.I.V. seeks to cut funds for Medicaid, a program that health officials say is a bedrock for people living with the virus. (It\u2019s no surprise that the region of the country with the highest H.I.V. burden \u2014 the South \u2014 also has the lowest participation in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.)\nStopping the infection from spreading \u2014 as it still does to some 40,000 previously uninfected Americans each year \u2014 will require evidence-based sex education and a large, concerted effort to test everyone who is at risk of contracting the virus. But the administration has worked aggressively to undermine Planned Parenthood, one of the few organizations to provide easily accessible H.I.V. testing in low-income communities around the country. And the Department of Health and Human Services has pushed abstinence-only programs that experts say severely undermine disease-prevention efforts.\nNudging those who are infected into treatment, and helping them stay the course, will require active campaigns to help remove the stigma, shame and fear of a diagnosis. Instead, the Trump administration has repeatedly supported or enacted policies that result in further marginalization of L.G.B.T.Q. communities, which still suffer a disproportionate burden of H.I.V. infection.\nTo eliminate H.I.V., the cost of medications capable of treating and preventing the disease will have to be sharply reduced (they currently cost tens of thousands of dollars a year per person). But so far, the administration has shown no appetite for using existing laws to override the patents of these drugs and produce them at cost \u2014 a move that may offer the best chance of getting these lifesaving medications to the two million or so people who need them.\nMore than two decades have passed since scientists first developed these medications. The latest plan might enable the United States to finally realize their full potential, but only if elected officials resolve the incongruities in their own policies.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Her name was Rosemary T. Vrablic. She was a managing director at Deutsche Bank and one of the reasons Mr. Trump had just taken the oath of office.</p>\n<p>It was a moment of celebration &mdash; and a moment of worry for Ms. Vrablic&rsquo;s employer.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank were deeply entwined, their symbiotic bond born of necessity and ambition on both sides: a real estate mogul made toxic by polarizing rhetoric and a pattern of defaults, and a bank with intractable financial problems and a history of misconduct.</p>\n<p>The relationship had paid off. Mr. Trump used loans from Deutsche Bank to finance skyscrapers and other high-end properties, and repeatedly cited his relationship with the bank to deflect political attacks on his business acumen. Deutsche Bank used Mr. Trump&rsquo;s projects to build its investment-banking business, reaped fees from the assets he put in its custody and leveraged his celebrity to lure clients.</p>\n<p>Then Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, and the German bank shifted into damage-control mode, bracing for an onslaught of public scrutiny, according to several people involved in the internal response.</p>\n<p>In the weeks before Ms. Vrablic attended his swearing-in, the bank commissioned reports to figure out how it had gotten in so deep with Mr. Trump. It issued an unusual edict to its Wall Street employees: Do not publicly utter the word &ldquo;Trump.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>More than two years later, Mr. Trump&rsquo;s financial ties <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/business/big-german-bank-key-to-trumps-finances-faces-new-scrutiny.html\">with Deutsche Bank</a> are the subject of investigations by two congressional committees and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/nyregion/deutsche-bank-trump.html?module=inline\">the New York attorney general</a>. Investigators hope to use Deutsche Bank as a window into Mr. Trump&rsquo;s personal and business finances.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank officials have quietly argued to regulators, lawmakers and journalists that Mr. Trump was not a priority for the bank or its senior leaders and that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former Deutsche Bank executives and board members, most of them with direct knowledge of the Trump relationship, contradict the bank&rsquo;s narrative.</p>\n<p>Over nearly two decades, Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s leaders repeatedly saw red flags surrounding Mr. Trump. There was a disastrous bond sale, a promised loan that relied on a banker&rsquo;s forged signature, wild exaggerations of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s wealth, even a claim of an act of God.</p>\n<p>But Deutsche Bank <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/deutsche-bank-donald-trump.html\">had a ravenous appetite for risk and limited concern</a> about its clients&rsquo; reputations. Time after time, with the support of two different chief executives, the bank handed money &mdash; a total of well over $2 billion &mdash; to a man whom nearly all other banks had deemed untouchable.</p>\n<p>Kerrie McHugh, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, said: &ldquo;We remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A company spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, declined to comment.</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;A Great Son!&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>In the late 1990s, Deutsche Bank, which is based in Germany, was trying to make a name for itself on Wall Street. Its investment-banking division went on a hiring binge.</p>\n<p>The bank recruited a handful of Goldman Sachs traders to lead a push into commercial real estate. One was Justin Kennedy, the son of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Another was Mike Offit, whose father was the writer Sidney Offit.</p>\n<p>At Deutsche Bank, Mr. Offit&rsquo;s mandate was to lend money to big real estate developers, package the loans into securities and sell the resulting bonds to investors. He said in an interview that one way to stand out in a crowded market was to make loans that his rivals considered too risky.</p>\n<p>In 1998, a broker contacted him to see if he would consider lending to a Wall Street pariah: Mr. Trump, who was then a casino magnate whose bankruptcies had cost banks hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>Mr. Offit took the meeting.</p>\n<p>A few days later, Mr. Offit&rsquo;s secretary called him. &ldquo;Donald Trump is in the conference room,&rdquo; she whispered. Mr. Offit said he rushed in, expecting to find an entourage. Mr. Trump was alone.</p>\n<p>He was looking for a $125 million loan to pay for gut renovations of 40 Wall Street, his Art Deco tower in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Offit was impressed by the pitch, and the loan sailed through Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s approval process.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump seemed giddy with gratitude, Mr. Offit recalled. He took Mr. Offit golfing. He flew him by helicopter to Atlantic City for boxing matches. He wrote a grateful note to Sidney Offit for having &ldquo;a great son!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Offit commissioned a detailed model of 40 Wall Street. A golden plaque on its pedestal bore the names and logos of Deutsche Bank and the Trump Organization. Mr. Offit gave one to Mr. Trump and kept another in his office.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump soon came looking for $300 million for the construction of a skyscraper across from the United Nations headquarters. The loan was approved. He wanted hundreds of millions more for his Trump Marina casino in Atlantic City. Mr. Offit pledged to line up cash for that, too.</p>\n<p>Not long after, Edson Mitchell, a top bank executive, discovered that the signature of the credit officer who had approved the Trump Marina deal had been forged, Mr. Offit said. (Mr. Offit was never accused of forgery; the loan never went through.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Offit was fired months later. He said it was because Mr. Mitchell claimed that he was reckless, a charge Mr. Offit disputed.</p>\n<p>It was the first hiccup in the Trump relationship. It would not be the last.</p>\n<h2>The Mar-a-Lago Reward</h2>\n<p>Over the next few years, the commercial real estate group, with Mr. Kennedy now in a senior role, kept lending to Mr. Trump, including to buy the General Motors building in Manhattan. Occasionally, Justice Kennedy stopped by Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s offices to say hello to the team, executives recalled.</p>\n<p>At an annual pro-am golf tournament the bank hosted outside Boston in the early 2000s, Mr. Trump sat down for a recorded interview with the bank&rsquo;s public relations staff, who asked about his experience with Deutsche Bank.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Mr. Trump exclaimed, according to a person who witnessed the interview. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really fast!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2003, a Deutsche Bank team led by Richard Byrne &mdash; a former casino-industry analyst who had known Mr. Trump since the 1980s &mdash; was hired to sell bonds on behalf of Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts. Bank officials escorted Mr. Trump to meet institutional investors in New York and Boston, according to an executive who attended.</p>\n<p>The so-called roadshow seemed to go well. At every stop, Mr. Trump was greeted by large audiences of fund managers, executives and lower-level employees eager to see the famous mogul. The problem, as a Deutsche Bank executive would explain to Mr. Trump, was that few of them were willing to entrust money to him.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump requested an audience with the bank&rsquo;s bond salesmen.</p>\n<p>According to a Deutsche Bank executive who heard the remarks, Mr. Trump gave a pep talk. &ldquo;Fellas, I know this isn&rsquo;t the easiest thing you&rsquo;ve had to sell,&rdquo; the executive recalled Mr. Trump saying. &ldquo;But if you get this done, you&rsquo;ll all be my guests at Mar-a-Lago,&rdquo; his private club in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>\n<p>The sales team managed to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds. Mr. Trump was pleased with the results when a Deutsche Bank executive called, according to a person who heard the conversation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget what you promised our guys,&rdquo; the executive reminded him.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump said he did not remember and that he doubted the salesmen actually expected to be taken to Mar-a-Lago.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve talked about the past week,&rdquo; the executive replied.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump ultimately flew about 15 salesmen to Florida on his Boeing 727. They spent a weekend golfing with Mr. Trump, two participants said.</p>\n<p>A year later, in 2004, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts defaulted on the bonds. Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s clients suffered steep losses. This arm of the investment-banking division stopped doing business with Mr. Trump.</p>\n<h2>An Act of God</h2>\n<p>Around that time, Mr. Trump returned to Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s commercial real estate unit &mdash; which was housed in a separate part of the sprawling investment-banking division &mdash; for another loan. This one was to build a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower.</p>\n<p>Josef Ackermann, the bank&rsquo;s chief executive, had publicly promised soaring profits, and with many of the company&rsquo;s businesses sputtering, the investment-banking group was under intense pressure to grow.</p>\n<p>As Deutsche Bank considered making the loan, Mr. Trump wooed bankers with flights on his private plane, according to a person familiar with the pitch. In a Trump Tower meeting, he told Mr. Kennedy that his daughter Ivanka would be in charge of the Chicago project, a sign of the family&rsquo;s commitment to its success.</p>\n<p>But there were warning signs.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former New York Times journalist Timothy O&rsquo;Brien. And a senior investment-banking executive said in an interview that he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, Deutsche Bank agreed in 2005 to lend Mr. Trump more than $500 million for the project. He personally guaranteed $40 million of it, meaning the bank could come after his personal assets if he defaulted.</p>\n<p>By 2008, the riverside skyscraper, one of the tallest in America, was mostly built. But with the economy sagging, Mr. Trump struggled to sell hundreds of condominium units. The bulk of the loan was due that November.</p>\n<p>Then the financial crisis hit, and Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers sensed an opportunity.</p>\n<p>A provision in the loan let Mr. Trump partially off the hook in the event of a &ldquo;force majeure,&rdquo; essentially an act of God, like a natural disaster. The former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had called the financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/business/worldbusiness/23iht-gspan.4.17206624.html\">a tsunami</a>. And what was a tsunami if not a natural disaster?</p>\n<p>One of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s lawyers, Steven Schlesinger, told him the provision could be used against Deutsche Bank.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s brilliant!&rdquo; Mr. Schlesinger recalled Mr. Trump responding.</p>\n<p>Days before the loan was due, Mr. Trump sued Deutsche Bank, citing the force majeure language and seeking $3 billion in damages. Deutsche Bank countersued and demanded payment of the $40 million that Mr. Trump had personally guaranteed.</p>\n<p>With the suits in court, senior investment-banking executives severed ties with Mr. Trump.</p>\n<h2>Luring a Banker</h2>\n<p>Not long after Mr. Trump got the Chicago loan &mdash; but before it went south &mdash; Deutsche Bank was expanding its private-banking division, which served the superrich. Executives said they set out to hire Ms. Vrablic, whom they viewed as the best private banker in New York.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, private bankers discreetly manage customers&rsquo; wealth and act as high-end concierges. Ms. Vrablic, who started her career as a bank teller and then worked at Citigroup and Bank of America, did that and more. She also arranged large real estate and commercial loans for her best clients.</p>\n<p>To lure her, Deutsche Bank guaranteed that she would earn at least $3 million a year, unusually rich terms for a private banker, and would bypass a layer of management to report directly to Thomas Bowers, the head of the American wealth-management division, according to people familiar with her contract.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Rosemary is widely recognized as one of the top private bankers to the U.S. ultra high-net-worth community,&rdquo; Mr. Bowers said in <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060914006053/en/Deutsche-Bank-Expands-Private-Wealth-Management-Business\">a September 2006 news release</a>. Deutsche Bank took out an ad in The Times to celebrate the arrival of her and a few colleagues.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic&rsquo;s superiors encouraged her to make loans that rival banks dismissed as too large or complex. They saw it as a way to elbow into the hypercompetitive New York market.</p>\n<h2>&lsquo;There Is No Objection&rsquo;</h2>\n<p>In 2010, Deutsche Bank and Mr. Trump settled their litigation over the Chicago loan. Mr. Trump agreed to repay most of what he owed by 2012, Mr. Schlesinger said.</p>\n<p>One of Ms. Vrablic&rsquo;s clients was Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009. Mr. Kushner regarded Ms. Vrablic as the best banker he had ever worked with, according to a person familiar with his thinking.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the Chicago lawsuit was settled, Mr. Kushner was told that Mr. Trump was looking for a loan and introduced him to Ms. Vrablic, according to people familiar with the relationship.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump flew Ms. Vrablic to Miami to show her a property he wanted to buy: the Doral Golf Resort and Spa. He needed more than $100 million for the 72-hole property.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank dispatched a team to Trump Tower to inspect Mr. Trump&rsquo;s personal and corporate financial records. The bankers determined he was overvaluing some of his real estate assets by as much as 70 percent, according to two former executives.</p>\n<p>By then, though, Mr. Trump had become a reality-TV star, and he was swimming in cash from &ldquo;The Apprentice.&rdquo; Deutsche Bank officials also were impressed that Mr. Trump did not have much debt, according to people who reviewed his finances. Aside from his history of defaults, he was an attractive borrower.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump also expressed interest in another loan from the private-banking division: $48 million for the same Chicago property that had provoked the two-year court fight.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump told the bank he would use that loan to repay what he still owed the investment-banking division, the two former executives said. Even by Wall Street standards, borrowing money from one part of a bank to pay off a loan from another was an extraordinary act of financial chutzpah.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Bowers tentatively agreed to both loans.</p>\n<p>Because these would be the private bank&rsquo;s first transactions with Mr. Trump, they needed approval up the chain of command.</p>\n<p>Investment-banking executives, including Anshu Jain, who would soon become Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s co-chief executive, pushed back. Lending to Mr. Trump again would be foolish, they argued, and signal to clients that they could default and even sue the bank.</p>\n<p>Executives in the private bank countered that the proposed loans had Mr. Trump&rsquo;s personal guarantee and therefore were low risk. And the Chicago loan, they noted, would lead to the repayment of tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump still owed the investment-banking division.</p>\n<p>A top executive with responsibility for the private bank discussed the loans with Mr. Ackermann, the chief executive, who supported them, according to two officials. A powerful committee in Frankfurt, which evaluated loans based on risks to the bank&rsquo;s reputation, signed off.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no objection from the bank to proceed with this client,&rdquo; wrote Stuart Clarke, the chief operating officer for the Americas, in a Dec. 5, 2011, email, according to a recipient.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank wired the money to Mr. Trump. The loans carried relatively low interest rates, executives said, but the business promised to be profitable: As part of the deal, Mr. Trump would hold millions of dollars in a personal account, generating fees for the bank.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have no recollection of having been asked to approve that private-banking loan,&rdquo; Mr. Ackermann said in an interview. He added: &ldquo;I would have approved it, if it came to me, if it was commercially sound.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>The C.E.O. Meets Trump</h2>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic&rsquo;s relationship with the Trumps deepened.</p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank lent money to Donald Trump Jr. for a South Carolina manufacturing venture that would soon go bankrupt. It provided a $15 million credit line to Mr. Kushner and his mother, according to financial documents reviewed by The Times. The bank previously had an informal ban on business with the Kushners because Jared&rsquo;s father, Charles, was a felon.</p>\n<p>In 2012, Jared Kushner recommended that the editor of The Mortgage Observer, one of the publications he owned, write a profile of Ms. Vrablic. The editor, Carl Gaines, knew Mr. Kushner was her client and objected, according to a person familiar with the exchange.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just go meet with her,&rdquo; Mr. Kushner said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll figure something out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://commercialobserver.com/2013/02/deutsche-banks-rosemary-vrablic-and-private-bankings-link-to-cre-finance/\">gauzy profile</a> of Ms. Vrablic was published in February 2013.</p>\n<p>Shortly afterward, the private bank produced a promotional video featuring some of its marquee clients. The video was played at a retreat for Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s senior leadership in Barcelona. In it, Ivanka Trump extolled the private bank&rsquo;s work with her family and thanked their relationship manager, according to two people who saw the video.</p>\n<p>In early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans.</p>\n<p>The owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion.</p>\n<p>Mr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trump&rsquo;s wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/donald-trump-buffalo-bills-deutsche-bank.html\">reached a similar conclusion</a>. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trump&rsquo;s bid, according to an executive involved.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s bid did not win, but another lending opportunity soon arose.</p>\n<p>A federal agency had selected Mr. Trump to transform the Old Post Office Building in Washington into a luxury hotel. But his financial partner &mdash; the private equity firm Colony Capital, run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr. &mdash; pulled out. Mr. Trump needed nearly $200 million.</p>\n<p>Because of his decades-long pattern of defaults and his increasingly polarizing political rhetoric &mdash; among other things, he had been spreading a lie about President Barack Obama being born overseas &mdash; Mr. Trump remained untouchable for most banks.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic was willing to help.</p>\n<p>In a memo outlining the rationale for the Old Post Office loan, Ms. Vrablic said Mr. Trump was expected to add large sums to his brokerage account if he received the loan, according to an executive who read the document.</p>\n<p>This time, there was less internal opposition. One reason: Mr. Jain &mdash; by then the bank&rsquo;s co-chief executive &mdash; had a solid relationship with Ms. Vrablic. Mr. Jain accompanied her to meetings with high-profile clients, and he praised her work to colleagues, multiple executives said.</p>\n<p>On a foggy Wednesday in February 2013, Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Jain went to Trump Tower to meet with Mr. Trump, according to two executives with knowledge of the meeting. Ms. Vrablic&rsquo;s rapport with the client was immediately clear: Mr. Trump&rsquo;s assistant greeted her as an old friend, and she seemed relaxed with Mr. Trump and his daughter, one executive said.</p>\n<p>They discussed Mr. Trump&rsquo;s finances over lunch, and Mr. Jain said he was surprised by his low level of debt, the executives said. After lunch, Ms. Vrablic told her colleagues that Mr. Jain had sounded upbeat about Mr. Trump&rsquo;s finances.</p>\n<p>A $170 million loan to pay for the overhaul of the Old Post Office went through in 2015, and Mr. Trump added more money to his brokerage account. (In May 2016, <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2838696-Trump-2016-Financial-Disclosure.html\">he reported</a> up to $46 million of stocks and bonds in the account.)</p>\n<p>On Aug. 6, 2015, Mr. Trump participated in the first Republican presidential debate. He clashed with the Fox News moderator, Megyn Kelly. He flew back to New York early the next morning. That evening, he called in to a CNN talk show and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/us/megyn-kelly-says-she-wont-be-cowed-by-donald-trump.html\">said of Ms. Kelly</a> that there was &ldquo;blood coming out of her wherever.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the intervening hours, Mr. Trump had used a black Sharpie to sign documents for another loan from Deutsche Bank: $19 million for the Doral resort. That brought to more than $300 million the total lent under Ms. Vrablic.</p>\n<h2>Shock and Anger</h2>\n<p>On the campaign trail, rivals assailed Mr. Trump&rsquo;s financial history. In response, he pointed to Deutsche Bank-funded successes like the Old Post Office project, now a gleaming hotel a few blocks from the White House.</p>\n<p>In early 2016, Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic for one final loan, for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic said yes, but a fight soon erupted.</p>\n<p>Jacques Brand, who was in charge of Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s American businesses, angrily objected, partly because of Mr. Trump&rsquo;s divisive rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic appealed the decision. Senior executives in Frankfurt, including Christian Sewing, who would become chief executive in 2018, were shocked that the private bank would consider lending Mr. Trump money during the campaign, bank officials said.</p>\n<p>The bank&rsquo;s reputational risk committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/business/trump-deutsche-bank.html\">killed the transaction</a> in March 2016.</p>\n<p>That same month, as The Times was preparing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/business/dealbook/donald-trump-relationship-bankers.html\">an article about Mr. Trump&rsquo;s excommunication from Wall Street</a>, he cited his warm relationship with Deutsche Bank.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They are totally happy with me,&rdquo; he said to The Times. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic. She is the boss.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Demagogy and Defaults</h2>\n<p>After Mr. Trump won the election, Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s board of directors rushed to understand how the bank had become the biggest lender to the president-elect.</p>\n<p>A report prepared by the board&rsquo;s integrity committee concluded that executives in the private-banking division were so determined to win business from big-name clients that they had ignored Mr. Trump&rsquo;s reputation for demagogy and defaults, according to a person who read the report.</p>\n<p>The review also found that Deutsche Bank had produced a number of &ldquo;exposure reports&rdquo; that flagged the growing business with Mr. Trump, but that they had not been adequately reviewed by senior executives.</p>\n<p>On Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s trading floor, managers began warning employees not to use the word &ldquo;Trump&rdquo; in communications with people outside the bank. Salesmen who violated the edict were scolded by compliance officers who said the bank feared stoking public interest in its ties to the new president.</p>\n<p>One reason: If Mr. Trump were to default on his loans, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between seizing his assets or cutting him a lucrative break &mdash; a situation the bank would rather resolve in private.</p>\n<p>Two years after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The chamber&rsquo;s financial services and intelligence committees opened investigations into Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s relationship with Mr. Trump. Those inquiries, as well as the New York attorney general&rsquo;s investigation, come at a perilous time for Deutsche Bank, which is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/business/dealbook/deutsche-bank-commerzbank-merger-germany.html\">negotiating to merge</a> with another large German lender.</p>\n<p>Next month, Deutsche Bank is likely to start handing over extensive internal documents and communications about Mr. Trump to the congressional committees, according to people briefed on the process.</p>\n<p>Ms. Vrablic, who is intensely private and rarely discusses her personal life with colleagues, declined to comment. People familiar with her thinking said she expected to be called to testify publicly on Capitol Hill.</p>",

                "text": "Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters\nAs President Trump delivered his inaugural address in 2017, a slight woman with feathered gray hair sat listening, bundled in a hooded white parka in a fenced-off V.I.P. section. Her name was Rosemary T. Vrablic. She was a managing director at Deutsche Bank and one of the reasons Mr. Trump had just taken the oath of office.\nIt was a moment of celebration \u2014 and a moment of worry for Ms. Vrablic\u2019s employer.\nMr. Trump and Deutsche Bank were deeply entwined, their symbiotic bond born of necessity and ambition on both sides: a real estate mogul made toxic by polarizing rhetoric and a pattern of defaults, and a bank with intractable financial problems and a history of misconduct.\nThe relationship had paid off. Mr. Trump used loans from Deutsche Bank to finance skyscrapers and other high-end properties, and repeatedly cited his relationship with the bank to deflect political attacks on his business acumen. Deutsche Bank used Mr. Trump\u2019s projects to build its investment-banking business, reaped fees from the assets he put in its custody and leveraged his celebrity to lure clients.\nThen Mr. Trump won the 2016 election, and the German bank shifted into damage-control mode, bracing for an onslaught of public scrutiny, according to several people involved in the internal response.\nIn the weeks before Ms. Vrablic attended his swearing-in, the bank commissioned reports to figure out how it had gotten in so deep with Mr. Trump. It issued an unusual edict to its Wall Street employees: Do not publicly utter the word \u201cTrump.\u201d\nMore than two years later, Mr. Trump\u2019s financial ties with Deutsche Bank are the subject of investigations by two congressional committees and the New York attorney general. Investigators hope to use Deutsche Bank as a window into Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business finances.\nDeutsche Bank officials have quietly argued to regulators, lawmakers and journalists that Mr. Trump was not a priority for the bank or its senior leaders and that the lending was the work of a single, obscure division. But interviews with more than 20 current and former Deutsche Bank executives and board members, most of them with direct knowledge of the Trump relationship, contradict the bank\u2019s narrative.\nOver nearly two decades, Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders repeatedly saw red flags surrounding Mr. Trump. There was a disastrous bond sale, a promised loan that relied on a banker\u2019s forged signature, wild exaggerations of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth, even a claim of an act of God.\nBut Deutsche Bank had a ravenous appetite for risk and limited concern about its clients\u2019 reputations. Time after time, with the support of two different chief executives, the bank handed money \u2014 a total of well over $2 billion \u2014 to a man whom nearly all other banks had deemed untouchable.\nKerrie McHugh, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe remain committed to cooperating with authorized investigations.\u201d\nThe White House referred questions to the Trump Organization. A company spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, declined to comment.\n\u2018A Great Son!\u2019\nIn the late 1990s, Deutsche Bank, which is based in Germany, was trying to make a name for itself on Wall Street. Its investment-banking division went on a hiring binge.\nThe bank recruited a handful of Goldman Sachs traders to lead a push into commercial real estate. One was Justin Kennedy, the son of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Another was Mike Offit, whose father was the writer Sidney Offit.\nAt Deutsche Bank, Mr. Offit\u2019s mandate was to lend money to big real estate developers, package the loans into securities and sell the resulting bonds to investors. He said in an interview that one way to stand out in a crowded market was to make loans that his rivals considered too risky.\nIn 1998, a broker contacted him to see if he would consider lending to a Wall Street pariah: Mr. Trump, who was then a casino magnate whose bankruptcies had cost banks hundreds of millions of dollars.\nMr. Offit took the meeting.\nA few days later, Mr. Offit\u2019s secretary called him. \u201cDonald Trump is in the conference room,\u201d she whispered. Mr. Offit said he rushed in, expecting to find an entourage. Mr. Trump was alone.\nHe was looking for a $125 million loan to pay for gut renovations of 40 Wall Street, his Art Deco tower in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Offit was impressed by the pitch, and the loan sailed through Deutsche Bank\u2019s approval process.\nMr. Trump seemed giddy with gratitude, Mr. Offit recalled. He took Mr. Offit golfing. He flew him by helicopter to Atlantic City for boxing matches. He wrote a grateful note to Sidney Offit for having \u201ca great son!\u201d\nMr. Offit commissioned a detailed model of 40 Wall Street. A golden plaque on its pedestal bore the names and logos of Deutsche Bank and the Trump Organization. Mr. Offit gave one to Mr. Trump and kept another in his office.\nMr. Trump soon came looking for $300 million for the construction of a skyscraper across from the United Nations headquarters. The loan was approved. He wanted hundreds of millions more for his Trump Marina casino in Atlantic City. Mr. Offit pledged to line up cash for that, too.\nNot long after, Edson Mitchell, a top bank executive, discovered that the signature of the credit officer who had approved the Trump Marina deal had been forged, Mr. Offit said. (Mr. Offit was never accused of forgery; the loan never went through.)\nMr. Offit was fired months later. He said it was because Mr. Mitchell claimed that he was reckless, a charge Mr. Offit disputed.\nIt was the first hiccup in the Trump relationship. It would not be the last.\nThe Mar-a-Lago Reward\nOver the next few years, the commercial real estate group, with Mr. Kennedy now in a senior role, kept lending to Mr. Trump, including to buy the General Motors building in Manhattan. Occasionally, Justice Kennedy stopped by Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices to say hello to the team, executives recalled.\nAt an annual pro-am golf tournament the bank hosted outside Boston in the early 2000s, Mr. Trump sat down for a recorded interview with the bank\u2019s public relations staff, who asked about his experience with Deutsche Bank.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d Mr. Trump exclaimed, according to a person who witnessed the interview. \u201cThey\u2019re really fast!\u201d\nIn 2003, a Deutsche Bank team led by Richard Byrne \u2014 a former casino-industry analyst who had known Mr. Trump since the 1980s \u2014 was hired to sell bonds on behalf of Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts. Bank officials escorted Mr. Trump to meet institutional investors in New York and Boston, according to an executive who attended.\nThe so-called roadshow seemed to go well. At every stop, Mr. Trump was greeted by large audiences of fund managers, executives and lower-level employees eager to see the famous mogul. The problem, as a Deutsche Bank executive would explain to Mr. Trump, was that few of them were willing to entrust money to him.\nMr. Trump requested an audience with the bank\u2019s bond salesmen.\nAccording to a Deutsche Bank executive who heard the remarks, Mr. Trump gave a pep talk. \u201cFellas, I know this isn\u2019t the easiest thing you\u2019ve had to sell,\u201d the executive recalled Mr. Trump saying. \u201cBut if you get this done, you\u2019ll all be my guests at Mar-a-Lago,\u201d his private club in Palm Beach, Fla.\nThe sales team managed to sell hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds. Mr. Trump was pleased with the results when a Deutsche Bank executive called, according to a person who heard the conversation.\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget what you promised our guys,\u201d the executive reminded him.\nMr. Trump said he did not remember and that he doubted the salesmen actually expected to be taken to Mar-a-Lago.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019ve talked about the past week,\u201d the executive replied.\nMr. Trump ultimately flew about 15 salesmen to Florida on his Boeing 727. They spent a weekend golfing with Mr. Trump, two participants said.\nA year later, in 2004, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts defaulted on the bonds. Deutsche Bank\u2019s clients suffered steep losses. This arm of the investment-banking division stopped doing business with Mr. Trump.\nAn Act of God\nAround that time, Mr. Trump returned to Deutsche Bank\u2019s commercial real estate unit \u2014 which was housed in a separate part of the sprawling investment-banking division \u2014 for another loan. This one was to build a 92-story skyscraper in Chicago, the Trump International Hotel and Tower.\nJosef Ackermann, the bank\u2019s chief executive, had publicly promised soaring profits, and with many of the company\u2019s businesses sputtering, the investment-banking group was under intense pressure to grow.\nAs Deutsche Bank considered making the loan, Mr. Trump wooed bankers with flights on his private plane, according to a person familiar with the pitch. In a Trump Tower meeting, he told Mr. Kennedy that his daughter Ivanka would be in charge of the Chicago project, a sign of the family\u2019s commitment to its success.\nBut there were warning signs.\nMr. Trump told Deutsche Bank his net worth was about $3 billion, but when bank employees reviewed his finances, they concluded he was worth about $788 million, according to documents produced during a lawsuit Mr. Trump brought against the former New York Times journalist Timothy O\u2019Brien. And a senior investment-banking executive said in an interview that he and others cautioned that Mr. Trump should be avoided because he had worked with people in the construction industry connected to organized crime.\nNonetheless, Deutsche Bank agreed in 2005 to lend Mr. Trump more than $500 million for the project. He personally guaranteed $40 million of it, meaning the bank could come after his personal assets if he defaulted.\nBy 2008, the riverside skyscraper, one of the tallest in America, was mostly built. But with the economy sagging, Mr. Trump struggled to sell hundreds of condominium units. The bulk of the loan was due that November.\nThen the financial crisis hit, and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sensed an opportunity.\nA provision in the loan let Mr. Trump partially off the hook in the event of a \u201cforce majeure,\u201d essentially an act of God, like a natural disaster. The former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan had called the financial crisis a tsunami. And what was a tsunami if not a natural disaster?\nOne of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, Steven Schlesinger, told him the provision could be used against Deutsche Bank.\n\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant!\u201d Mr. Schlesinger recalled Mr. Trump responding.\nDays before the loan was due, Mr. Trump sued Deutsche Bank, citing the force majeure language and seeking $3 billion in damages. Deutsche Bank countersued and demanded payment of the $40 million that Mr. Trump had personally guaranteed.\nWith the suits in court, senior investment-banking executives severed ties with Mr. Trump.\nLuring a Banker\nNot long after Mr. Trump got the Chicago loan \u2014 but before it went south \u2014 Deutsche Bank was expanding its private-banking division, which served the superrich. Executives said they set out to hire Ms. Vrablic, whom they viewed as the best private banker in New York.\nTraditionally, private bankers discreetly manage customers\u2019 wealth and act as high-end concierges. Ms. Vrablic, who started her career as a bank teller and then worked at Citigroup and Bank of America, did that and more. She also arranged large real estate and commercial loans for her best clients.\nTo lure her, Deutsche Bank guaranteed that she would earn at least $3 million a year, unusually rich terms for a private banker, and would bypass a layer of management to report directly to Thomas Bowers, the head of the American wealth-management division, according to people familiar with her contract.\n\u201cRosemary is widely recognized as one of the top private bankers to the U.S. ultra high-net-worth community,\u201d Mr. Bowers said in a September 2006 news release. Deutsche Bank took out an ad in The Times to celebrate the arrival of her and a few colleagues.\nMs. Vrablic\u2019s superiors encouraged her to make loans that rival banks dismissed as too large or complex. They saw it as a way to elbow into the hypercompetitive New York market.\n\u2018There Is No Objection\u2019\nIn 2010, Deutsche Bank and Mr. Trump settled their litigation over the Chicago loan. Mr. Trump agreed to repay most of what he owed by 2012, Mr. Schlesinger said.\nOne of Ms. Vrablic\u2019s clients was Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009. Mr. Kushner regarded Ms. Vrablic as the best banker he had ever worked with, according to a person familiar with his thinking.\nShortly after the Chicago lawsuit was settled, Mr. Kushner was told that Mr. Trump was looking for a loan and introduced him to Ms. Vrablic, according to people familiar with the relationship.\nMr. Trump flew Ms. Vrablic to Miami to show her a property he wanted to buy: the Doral Golf Resort and Spa. He needed more than $100 million for the 72-hole property.\nDeutsche Bank dispatched a team to Trump Tower to inspect Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and corporate financial records. The bankers determined he was overvaluing some of his real estate assets by as much as 70 percent, according to two former executives.\nBy then, though, Mr. Trump had become a reality-TV star, and he was swimming in cash from \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Deutsche Bank officials also were impressed that Mr. Trump did not have much debt, according to people who reviewed his finances. Aside from his history of defaults, he was an attractive borrower.\nMr. Trump also expressed interest in another loan from the private-banking division: $48 million for the same Chicago property that had provoked the two-year court fight.\nMr. Trump told the bank he would use that loan to repay what he still owed the investment-banking division, the two former executives said. Even by Wall Street standards, borrowing money from one part of a bank to pay off a loan from another was an extraordinary act of financial chutzpah.\nMs. Vrablic and Mr. Bowers tentatively agreed to both loans.\nBecause these would be the private bank\u2019s first transactions with Mr. Trump, they needed approval up the chain of command.\nInvestment-banking executives, including Anshu Jain, who would soon become Deutsche Bank\u2019s co-chief executive, pushed back. Lending to Mr. Trump again would be foolish, they argued, and signal to clients that they could default and even sue the bank.\nExecutives in the private bank countered that the proposed loans had Mr. Trump\u2019s personal guarantee and therefore were low risk. And the Chicago loan, they noted, would lead to the repayment of tens of millions of dollars that Mr. Trump still owed the investment-banking division.\nA top executive with responsibility for the private bank discussed the loans with Mr. Ackermann, the chief executive, who supported them, according to two officials. A powerful committee in Frankfurt, which evaluated loans based on risks to the bank\u2019s reputation, signed off.\n\u201cThere is no objection from the bank to proceed with this client,\u201d wrote Stuart Clarke, the chief operating officer for the Americas, in a Dec. 5, 2011, email, according to a recipient.\nDeutsche Bank wired the money to Mr. Trump. The loans carried relatively low interest rates, executives said, but the business promised to be profitable: As part of the deal, Mr. Trump would hold millions of dollars in a personal account, generating fees for the bank.\n\u201cI have no recollection of having been asked to approve that private-banking loan,\u201d Mr. Ackermann said in an interview. He added: \u201cI would have approved it, if it came to me, if it was commercially sound.\u201d\nThe C.E.O. Meets Trump\nMs. Vrablic\u2019s relationship with the Trumps deepened.\nDeutsche Bank lent money to Donald Trump Jr. for a South Carolina manufacturing venture that would soon go bankrupt. It provided a $15 million credit line to Mr. Kushner and his mother, according to financial documents reviewed by The Times. The bank previously had an informal ban on business with the Kushners because Jared\u2019s father, Charles, was a felon.\nIn 2012, Jared Kushner recommended that the editor of The Mortgage Observer, one of the publications he owned, write a profile of Ms. Vrablic. The editor, Carl Gaines, knew Mr. Kushner was her client and objected, according to a person familiar with the exchange.\n\u201cJust go meet with her,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\nA gauzy profile of Ms. Vrablic was published in February 2013.\nShortly afterward, the private bank produced a promotional video featuring some of its marquee clients. The video was played at a retreat for Deutsche Bank\u2019s senior leadership in Barcelona. In it, Ivanka Trump extolled the private bank\u2019s work with her family and thanked their relationship manager, according to two people who saw the video.\nIn early 2014, Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, approached Ms. Vrablic about more potential loans.\nThe owner of the Buffalo Bills had died, and the N.F.L. franchise was up for sale. Mr. Trump was interested, and he needed to show the league he had the financial wherewithal to pull off a transaction that could top $1 billion.\nMr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic if the bank would be willing to make a loan and handed over bare-bones financial statements that estimated his net worth at $8.7 billion.\nMr. Cohen testified to Congress last month that the documents exaggerated Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth. Deutsche Bank executives had reached a similar conclusion. They nonetheless agreed to vouch for Mr. Trump\u2019s bid, according to an executive involved.\nMr. Trump\u2019s bid did not win, but another lending opportunity soon arose.\nA federal agency had selected Mr. Trump to transform the Old Post Office Building in Washington into a luxury hotel. But his financial partner \u2014 the private equity firm Colony Capital, run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr. \u2014 pulled out. Mr. Trump needed nearly $200 million.\nBecause of his decades-long pattern of defaults and his increasingly polarizing political rhetoric \u2014 among other things, he had been spreading a lie about President Barack Obama being born overseas \u2014 Mr. Trump remained untouchable for most banks.\nMs. Vrablic was willing to help.\nIn a memo outlining the rationale for the Old Post Office loan, Ms. Vrablic said Mr. Trump was expected to add large sums to his brokerage account if he received the loan, according to an executive who read the document.\nThis time, there was less internal opposition. One reason: Mr. Jain \u2014 by then the bank\u2019s co-chief executive \u2014 had a solid relationship with Ms. Vrablic. Mr. Jain accompanied her to meetings with high-profile clients, and he praised her work to colleagues, multiple executives said.\nOn a foggy Wednesday in February 2013, Ms. Vrablic and Mr. Jain went to Trump Tower to meet with Mr. Trump, according to two executives with knowledge of the meeting. Ms. Vrablic\u2019s rapport with the client was immediately clear: Mr. Trump\u2019s assistant greeted her as an old friend, and she seemed relaxed with Mr. Trump and his daughter, one executive said.\nThey discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s finances over lunch, and Mr. Jain said he was surprised by his low level of debt, the executives said. After lunch, Ms. Vrablic told her colleagues that Mr. Jain had sounded upbeat about Mr. Trump\u2019s finances.\nA $170 million loan to pay for the overhaul of the Old Post Office went through in 2015, and Mr. Trump added more money to his brokerage account. (In May 2016, he reported up to $46 million of stocks and bonds in the account.)\nOn Aug. 6, 2015, Mr. Trump participated in the first Republican presidential debate. He clashed with the Fox News moderator, Megyn Kelly. He flew back to New York early the next morning. That evening, he called in to a CNN talk show and said of Ms. Kelly that there was \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d\nIn the intervening hours, Mr. Trump had used a black Sharpie to sign documents for another loan from Deutsche Bank: $19 million for the Doral resort. That brought to more than $300 million the total lent under Ms. Vrablic.\nShock and Anger\nOn the campaign trail, rivals assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s financial history. In response, he pointed to Deutsche Bank-funded successes like the Old Post Office project, now a gleaming hotel a few blocks from the White House.\nIn early 2016, Mr. Trump asked Ms. Vrablic for one final loan, for his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland.\nMs. Vrablic said yes, but a fight soon erupted.\nJacques Brand, who was in charge of Deutsche Bank\u2019s American businesses, angrily objected, partly because of Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric.\nMs. Vrablic appealed the decision. Senior executives in Frankfurt, including Christian Sewing, who would become chief executive in 2018, were shocked that the private bank would consider lending Mr. Trump money during the campaign, bank officials said.\nThe bank\u2019s reputational risk committee killed the transaction in March 2016.\nThat same month, as The Times was preparing an article about Mr. Trump\u2019s excommunication from Wall Street, he cited his warm relationship with Deutsche Bank.\n\u201cThey are totally happy with me,\u201d he said to The Times. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the head of Deutsche Bank? Her name is Rosemary Vrablic. She is the boss.\u201d\nDemagogy and Defaults\nAfter Mr. Trump won the election, Deutsche Bank\u2019s board of directors rushed to understand how the bank had become the biggest lender to the president-elect.\nA report prepared by the board\u2019s integrity committee concluded that executives in the private-banking division were so determined to win business from big-name clients that they had ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s reputation for demagogy and defaults, according to a person who read the report.\nThe review also found that Deutsche Bank had produced a number of \u201cexposure reports\u201d that flagged the growing business with Mr. Trump, but that they had not been adequately reviewed by senior executives.\nOn Deutsche Bank\u2019s trading floor, managers began warning employees not to use the word \u201cTrump\u201d in communications with people outside the bank. Salesmen who violated the edict were scolded by compliance officers who said the bank feared stoking public interest in its ties to the new president.\nOne reason: If Mr. Trump were to default on his loans, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between seizing his assets or cutting him a lucrative break \u2014 a situation the bank would rather resolve in private.\nTwo years after Mr. Trump was sworn in, Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The chamber\u2019s financial services and intelligence committees opened investigations into Deutsche Bank\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump. Those inquiries, as well as the New York attorney general\u2019s investigation, come at a perilous time for Deutsche Bank, which is negotiating to merge with another large German lender.\nNext month, Deutsche Bank is likely to start handing over extensive internal documents and communications about Mr. Trump to the congressional committees, according to people briefed on the process.\nMs. Vrablic, who is intensely private and rarely discusses her personal life with colleagues, declined to comment. People familiar with her thinking said she expected to be called to testify publicly on Capitol Hill.",

The original video was taken down <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/15/facebook-youtube-twitter-amplified-video-christchurch-mosque-shooting/?utm_term=.d5c5451499d2\">within an hour</a>. But copies proliferated across the major platforms.</p>\n<p>On Saturday night, Facebook <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1107117981358682112\">announced</a> that it had removed 1.5 million copies of the video, with 1.2 million blocked at the moment they were uploaded. YouTube declined to give numbers, although its chief product officer told The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/03/18/inside-youtubes-struggles-shut-down-video-new-zealand-shooting-humans-who-outsmarted-its-systems/?utm_term=.d3d426a7959d\">Washington Post</a> that at times, a copy of the video was being uploaded every second.</p>\n<p>After decades of shunning responsibility for user content, Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society &mdash; banning anti-vaccine misinformation, for instance, and cracking down on political disinformation. More moderation comes with heavy risks, of course. Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders. But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps. Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer. It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good, instead of ignoring it.</p>\n<p>There is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings, since media amplification can inspire <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/11/americas-mass-shooting-epidemic-contagious/545078/\">copycat killings</a>, and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts.</p>\n<p>Filtering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence &mdash; copyright infringement never kills anyone, even if it stays up for a week. On longer time scales, moderation works reasonably well.</p>\n<p>For about a decade or longer, the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of &ldquo;fingerprinted&rdquo; videos. Starting in 2016, major platforms adapted that technology to filter for <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/partnering-to-help-curb-spread-of-online-terrorist-content/\">&ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; content</a>.</p>\n<p>But this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting. Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately, countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting, editing, watermarking and modifying the video itself. While harder to find on major social media platforms, copies of the video are still easily found online.</p>\n<p>It was once the sole province of the press to think about how to cover such tragedies in a responsible way. As media consumption shifts online, it is now on the tech companies to use their considerable ingenuity to grapple with mitigating the public health crisis of mass killings.</p>\n<p>Keeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">experience of </a><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona\">content moderators</a> for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.</p>\n<p>Repeated exposure to conspiracy theories &mdash; say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn&rsquo;t happen &mdash; turns out to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/3/6/18252412/content-moderator-conspiracy-theories-stress-exposure\">sway content moderators</a>, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.</p>\n<p>We don&rsquo;t know if moderators are canaries for the social-media-consuming public at large or if their heavy dose of the worst of the web makes them outliers. Is repeated exposure to conspiracy theories &mdash; often given boosts by recommendation algorithms &mdash; swaying the general public, in some cases leading to public health emergencies like the measles outbreak? Is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/opinion/sunday/facebook-twitter-terrorism-extremism.html\">extremist propaganda</a> fueling a surge in right-wing violence?</p>\n<p>The killer in New Zealand sought to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/asia/new-zealand-gunman-christchurch.html\">hijack the attention of the internet</a>, and the millions of uploads of his video &mdash; both attempted and achieved &mdash; were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.</p>\n<p>In the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It&rsquo;s not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/whatsapp-destroyed-village-lynchings-rainpada-india\">lynching</a>s fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-whatsapp/facebooks-whatsapp-limits-text-forwards-to-five-recipients-to-curb-rumors-idUSKCN1PF0TP\">global in January</a> in an effort to fight &ldquo;misinformation and rumors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s telling that the platforms must make themselves less functional in the interests of public safety. What happened this weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also the outcome least likely to happen.</p>\n<p><em>The Times is committed to publishing </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\"><em>a diversity of letters</em></a><em> to the editor.

                "text": "Danielle Chenette\nAs authorities rushed to stop a gunman on a mass killing spree in New Zealand, engineers, programmers and content moderators around the globe were scrambling to keep the rampage from going viral.\nIt didn\u2019t work.\nThe terrorist in Christchurch killed 50 people at two mosques on Friday, livestreaming part of the attack on Facebook. The original video was taken down within an hour. But copies proliferated across the major platforms.\nOn Saturday night, Facebook announced that it had removed 1.5 million copies of the video, with 1.2 million blocked at the moment they were uploaded. YouTube declined to give numbers, although its chief product officer told The Washington Post that at times, a copy of the video was being uploaded every second.\nAfter decades of shunning responsibility for user content, Big Tech is slowly making its products safer for society \u2014 banning anti-vaccine misinformation, for instance, and cracking down on political disinformation. More moderation comes with heavy risks, of course. Decisions about the limits of free speech would shift to companies whose priorities are driven by shareholders. But the viral spread of the Christchurch shooting video shows the limits of the content moderation machine in the face of technologies that have been designed to be attention traps. Stricter moderation or filtering systems are not the answer. It must be a priority to redesign technology to respect the common good, instead of ignoring it.\nThere is a special urgency when it comes to mass killings, since media amplification can inspire copycat killings, and only so much can be done in a crisis where every hour counts.\nFiltering systems have been relatively successful where time is not of the essence \u2014 copyright infringement never kills anyone, even if it stays up for a week. On longer time scales, moderation works reasonably well.\nFor about a decade or longer, the tech companies have automatically filtered out child pornography in a partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which maintains a database of \u201cfingerprinted\u201d videos. Starting in 2016, major platforms adapted that technology to filter for \u201cterrorist\u201d content.\nBut this kind of filtering only works when new content matches known banned content through a form of digital fingerprinting. Although the video of the New Zealand attack was fingerprinted immediately, countless thousands of people beat the filter over and over again by recutting, editing, watermarking and modifying the video itself. While harder to find on major social media platforms, copies of the video are still easily found online.\nIt was once the sole province of the press to think about how to cover such tragedies in a responsible way. As media consumption shifts online, it is now on the tech companies to use their considerable ingenuity to grapple with mitigating the public health crisis of mass killings.\nKeeping the internet, or at the very least social media, free from vile content is grueling work. The experience of content moderators for Facebook raises troubling questions about the future of human moderation and the wider danger that online content poses to public health.\nRepeated exposure to conspiracy theories \u2014 say, that the earth is flat or that the Holocaust didn\u2019t happen \u2014 turns out to sway content moderators, an effect that may very well be playing out in the population at large. Repeated exposure to images of violence and sexual exploitation often leaves moderators with post-traumatic stress disorder. Moderators have reported crying on the job or sleeping with guns by their side. Turnover is high, pay is low, and although they have access to on-site counselors, many moderators develop symptoms of PTSD after leaving the job.\nWe don\u2019t know if moderators are canaries for the social-media-consuming public at large or if their heavy dose of the worst of the web makes them outliers. Is repeated exposure to conspiracy theories \u2014 often given boosts by recommendation algorithms \u2014 swaying the general public, in some cases leading to public health emergencies like the measles outbreak? Is extremist propaganda fueling a surge in right-wing violence?\nThe killer in New Zealand sought to hijack the attention of the internet, and the millions of uploads of his video \u2014 both attempted and achieved \u2014 were a natural consequence of what the platforms are designed to promote in users: the desire to make content go viral.\nIn the midst of the crisis this weekend, YouTube resorted to temporarily disabling the ability to search recently uploaded videos. It\u2019s not the first time a platform has disabled a function of its product in response to tragedy. In July, WhatsApp limited message forwarding in India in the wake of lynchings fueled by rumors spread by users of the service. The change became global in January in an effort to fight \u201cmisinformation and rumors.\u201d\nIt\u2019s telling that the platforms must make themselves less functional in the interests of public safety. What happened this weekend gives an inkling of how intractable the problem may be. Internet platforms have been designed to monopolize human attention by any means necessary, and the content moderation machine is a flimsy check on a system that strives to overcome all forms of friction. The best outcome for the public now may be that Big Tech limits its own usability and reach, even if that comes at the cost of some profitability. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the outcome least likely to happen.\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Authorities around the world are now taking a closer look at the jet&rsquo;s approval by the F.A.A., a process that relies heavily on Boeing employees to certify the safety of the plane.</p>\n<p>The 737 Max was one of the first commercial jets approved under new rules, which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous planes were certified. And the software system did not raise warnings during the approval process. Top F.A.A. officials, who are briefed on significant safety issues, were not aware of the software system, according to three people with knowledge of the process.</p>\n<p>The United States transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, on Tuesday called for her agency&rsquo;s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process, saying that &ldquo;safety is the top priority of the department.&rdquo; Lawmakers in the United States are similarly pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane&rsquo;s American certification.</p>\n<p>The scrutiny adds to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/business/boeing-737-max-ceo.html\">the pressure at Boeing</a>, an aerospace giant with a strong safety record. The 737 Max, its best-selling jet, has more than 4,600 pending orders, which are expected to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years.</p>\n<p>The plane is now grounded as the company races to come up with a fix to the software. It is unclear when the jet will start flying again.</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Boeing said the manufacturer would cooperate with the audit by the Department of Transportation. It has defended the certification process for the jet, saying that &ldquo;the 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F.A.A. requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The F.A.A.&rsquo;s response to the crisis has also come under scrutiny. As authorities in other countries moved quickly to ban the plane following the crash in Ethiopia this month, the American regulator held off.</p>\n<p>The F.A.A. has been run by an acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, since January 2018. President Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/faa-stephen-dickson-trump.html\">on Tuesday</a> picked a former Delta Air Lines executive, Stephen Dickson, to become the permanent head of the agency.</p>\n<p>Before a new plane can fly, the F.A.A., in partnership with manufacturers, assesses the technology, design and components that make up the jet. They look for potential safety issues that could affect the airworthiness of the plane.</p>\n<p>The investigations into the crashes are ongoing, but the similarities between the two doomed flights suggest potential problems with the new software system, known as MCAS. In the case of the Lion Air crash in October, the automated system may have engaged based on erroneous data, creating a struggle for the pilots who were trying to maintain control.</p>\n<p>But the software &mdash; powerful as it was &mdash; did not emerge as a major focus for the F.A.A. regulators who certified the Max as safe to fly in 2017, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process.</p>\n<p>The software did not elicit what are known as special conditions, usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulations before it can be certified as safe. The plane&rsquo;s non-rechargeable lithium batteries, for example, fell into that category.</p>\n<p>Because the system was not flagged as especially noteworthy, senior F.A.A. officials were not even aware of it, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process. Instead, it was only lower-level F.A.A. officials involved in the certification process who were even aware of MCAS.</p>\n<p>The system was intended as a safety feature to make the 737 Max, which included significant design changes, fly like earlier models.</p>\n<p>The new, more efficient engines on the 737 Max were larger and placed in a different location than previous generations. To compensate for the new aerodynamics, Boeing installed the software, which would force the nose of the plane down in certain circumstances. The goal was to help avoid a stall.</p>\n<p>The F.A.A., in its approval of the plane, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/boeing-max-flight-simulator-ethiopia-lion-air.html\">did not require training</a> on the software, a sign that regulators did not see the system as critical for pilots to understand. Nor did the F.A.A. require pilots who could fly the predecessor 737 to train on a simulator in order to fly the Max. Most pilots did not know about MCAS until after the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/world/asia/lion-air-crash-boeing.html\">Lion Air crash</a>.</p>\n<p>The regulators also approved the software to be triggered after receiving data from only one so-called angle-of-attack sensor. The decision allowed for the system to have a single point of potential failure, a rarity in aviation safety.</p>\n<p>Most important safety systems include redundancy. The coming software fix by Boeing will require data from both of the plane&rsquo;s angle-of-attack sensors, among other changes, according to pilots and lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Certifying the 737 Max was a collaborative effort between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The regulator for decades has relied on employees at aircraft manufacturers to assist in the review process.</p>\n<p>In 2005, the F.A.A. delegated more authority to companies, allowing manufacturers like Boeing to select their own employees who would help with certification work. And the 737 Max, which started going through certification process in 2012, was one of the first passenger jets to be approved under this new program.</p>\n<p>In regards to the F.A.A. inquiry, a spokesman for the Transportation Department&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General said the office was &ldquo;currently developing the scope and objectives of our review&rdquo; and expected &ldquo;to formally announce and begin our audit work as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The F.A.A. declined to comment on Tuesday. The agency has said that its &ldquo;aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,&rdquo; and that the certification of the Max &ldquo;followed the F.A.A.&rsquo;s standard certification process.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For regulators, outsourcing part of the review process was a way to stretch their resources. For American plane manufacturers like Boeing, it was critical for speeding up the regulatory process, as they try to compete with foreign rivals.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People want oversight when something goes wrong,&rdquo; said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aviation accidents. &ldquo;But at the same time, they do not want these companies tied up in knots and not able to produce products for the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ali Bahrami, the F.A.A.&rsquo;s top safety official, used to be an executive at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group whose members include Boeing as well as many other companies in the aviation industry. In 2013, he urged the F.A.A. to &ldquo;allow maximum use of delegation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;With the worldwide market shifting to Asia and the developing world, it would be detrimental to our competitiveness if foreign manufacturers are able to move improved products into the marketplace more quickly,&rdquo; he said in <a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/pw/pw05/20131030/101419/hhrg-113-pw05-wstate-bahramia-20131030.pdf\">prepared testimony</a> for a congressional hearing.</p>\n<p>But the relationship between Boeing and the F.A.A. prompted concern even before the 737 Max crashes.</p>\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/files/I10A000073SINV%20ROI.pdf\">an investigation</a> by the Transportation Department&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A. managers had not always been supportive of efforts by agency employees to &ldquo;hold Boeing accountable.&rdquo; F.A.A. employees viewed their management as &ldquo;having too close a relationship with Boeing officials,&rdquo; according to a report from the inspector general&rsquo;s office.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Oversight%20of%20ODA%20Final%20Report%5E10-15-15.pdf\">2015 report</a> by the inspector general&rsquo;s office expressed concern about the certification process. &ldquo;During our review, industry representatives expressed concern that F.A.A.&rsquo;s focus was often on paperwork &mdash; not on safety-critical items,&rdquo; the report said.</p>\n<p>The same year, a Boeing executive at a congressional hearing described the arrangement as effectively having an &ldquo;arm of the F.A.A. within the Boeing Company.&rdquo; Some 1,000 employees, the executive said, were part of the program.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Boeing and the F.A.A. have had an almost symbiotic relationship,&rdquo; said Michael Dreikorn, an aviation safety expert who previously worked in a safety oversight role at the F.A.A. &ldquo;The relationship is too cozy.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Matt York/Associated Press\nAs regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration reviewed designs for Boeing\u2019s newest passenger jet, they paid extra attention to several features, including the lithium batteries, the pressure fueling system and the inflatable safety slides.\nOne feature that did not receive exceptional scrutiny: a new software system intended to prevent stalls.\nThat same software is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving the same jet, the Boeing 737 Max. Authorities around the world are now taking a closer look at the jet\u2019s approval by the F.A.A., a process that relies heavily on Boeing employees to certify the safety of the plane.\nThe 737 Max was one of the first commercial jets approved under new rules, which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous planes were certified. And the software system did not raise warnings during the approval process. Top F.A.A. officials, who are briefed on significant safety issues, were not aware of the software system, according to three people with knowledge of the process.\nThe United States transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, on Tuesday called for her agency\u2019s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process, saying that \u201csafety is the top priority of the department.\u201d Lawmakers in the United States are similarly pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane\u2019s American certification.\nThe scrutiny adds to the pressure at Boeing, an aerospace giant with a strong safety record. The 737 Max, its best-selling jet, has more than 4,600 pending orders, which are expected to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years.\nThe plane is now grounded as the company races to come up with a fix to the software. It is unclear when the jet will start flying again.\nA spokesman for Boeing said the manufacturer would cooperate with the audit by the Department of Transportation. It has defended the certification process for the jet, saying that \u201cthe 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F.A.A. requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.\u201d\nThe F.A.A.\u2019s response to the crisis has also come under scrutiny. As authorities in other countries moved quickly to ban the plane following the crash in Ethiopia this month, the American regulator held off.\nThe F.A.A. has been run by an acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, since January 2018. President Trump on Tuesday picked a former Delta Air Lines executive, Stephen Dickson, to become the permanent head of the agency.\nBefore a new plane can fly, the F.A.A., in partnership with manufacturers, assesses the technology, design and components that make up the jet. They look for potential safety issues that could affect the airworthiness of the plane.\nThe investigations into the crashes are ongoing, but the similarities between the two doomed flights suggest potential problems with the new software system, known as MCAS. In the case of the Lion Air crash in October, the automated system may have engaged based on erroneous data, creating a struggle for the pilots who were trying to maintain control.\nBut the software \u2014 powerful as it was \u2014 did not emerge as a major focus for the F.A.A. regulators who certified the Max as safe to fly in 2017, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process.\nThe software did not elicit what are known as special conditions, usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulations before it can be certified as safe. The plane\u2019s non-rechargeable lithium batteries, for example, fell into that category.\nBecause the system was not flagged as especially noteworthy, senior F.A.A. officials were not even aware of it, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process. Instead, it was only lower-level F.A.A. officials involved in the certification process who were even aware of MCAS.\nThe system was intended as a safety feature to make the 737 Max, which included significant design changes, fly like earlier models.\nThe new, more efficient engines on the 737 Max were larger and placed in a different location than previous generations. To compensate for the new aerodynamics, Boeing installed the software, which would force the nose of the plane down in certain circumstances. The goal was to help avoid a stall.\nThe F.A.A., in its approval of the plane, did not require training on the software, a sign that regulators did not see the system as critical for pilots to understand. Nor did the F.A.A. require pilots who could fly the predecessor 737 to train on a simulator in order to fly the Max. Most pilots did not know about MCAS until after the Lion Air crash.\nThe regulators also approved the software to be triggered after receiving data from only one so-called angle-of-attack sensor. The decision allowed for the system to have a single point of potential failure, a rarity in aviation safety.\nMost important safety systems include redundancy. The coming software fix by Boeing will require data from both of the plane\u2019s angle-of-attack sensors, among other changes, according to pilots and lawmakers.\nCertifying the 737 Max was a collaborative effort between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The regulator for decades has relied on employees at aircraft manufacturers to assist in the review process.\nIn 2005, the F.A.A. delegated more authority to companies, allowing manufacturers like Boeing to select their own employees who would help with certification work. And the 737 Max, which started going through certification process in 2012, was one of the first passenger jets to be approved under this new program.\nIn regards to the F.A.A. inquiry, a spokesman for the Transportation Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General said the office was \u201ccurrently developing the scope and objectives of our review\u201d and expected \u201cto formally announce and begin our audit work as soon as possible.\u201d\nThe F.A.A. declined to comment on Tuesday. The agency has said that its \u201caircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,\u201d and that the certification of the Max \u201cfollowed the F.A.A.\u2019s standard certification process.\u201d\nFor regulators, outsourcing part of the review process was a way to stretch their resources. For American plane manufacturers like Boeing, it was critical for speeding up the regulatory process, as they try to compete with foreign rivals.\n\u201cPeople want oversight when something goes wrong,\u201d said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aviation accidents. \u201cBut at the same time, they do not want these companies tied up in knots and not able to produce products for the marketplace.\u201d\nAli Bahrami, the F.A.A.\u2019s top safety official, used to be an executive at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group whose members include Boeing as well as many other companies in the aviation industry. In 2013, he urged the F.A.A. to \u201callow maximum use of delegation.\u201d\n\u201cWith the worldwide market shifting to Asia and the developing world, it would be detrimental to our competitiveness if foreign manufacturers are able to move improved products into the marketplace more quickly,\u201d he said in prepared testimony for a congressional hearing.\nBut the relationship between Boeing and the F.A.A. prompted concern even before the 737 Max crashes.\nIn 2012, an investigation by the Transportation Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A. managers had not always been supportive of efforts by agency employees to \u201chold Boeing accountable.\u201d F.A.A. employees viewed their management as \u201chaving too close a relationship with Boeing officials,\u201d according to a report from the inspector general\u2019s office.\nA 2015 report by the inspector general\u2019s office expressed concern about the certification process. \u201cDuring our review, industry representatives expressed concern that F.A.A.\u2019s focus was often on paperwork \u2014 not on safety-critical items,\u201d the report said.\nThe same year, a Boeing executive at a congressional hearing described the arrangement as effectively having an \u201carm of the F.A.A. within the Boeing Company.\u201d Some 1,000 employees, the executive said, were part of the program.\n\u201cBoeing and the F.A.A. have had an almost symbiotic relationship,\u201d said Michael Dreikorn, an aviation safety expert who previously worked in a safety oversight role at the F.A.A. \u201cThe relationship is too cozy.\u201d",

Bernstein/Reuters</p>\n<p>The Business Roundtable, the top lobbying organization for industry in Washington, is often characterized as a nonpartisan or bipartisan organization.</p>\n<p>It represents more than 200 large companies &mdash; from oil giants to tech sweethearts &mdash; with more than $7 trillion of revenue and more than 15 million workers of all political stripes.</p>\n<p>But nobody is truly apolitical, and in an age when we increasingly see our business leaders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/business/dealbook/saudi-arabia-journalist-business-executives.html\">filling the vacuum left by our political leaders</a>, it&rsquo;s important that the public fully understand the views of these unelected leaders.</p>\n<p>So a team of researchers working with the Harvard Law School program on corporate governance set out to <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3355690\">find the political inclinations of top executives</a> &mdash; not just the 200 who make up the Business Roundtable, but all the executives of the S&amp;P 1500, a stock index that covers 90 percent of the United States&rsquo; market capitalization.</p>\n<p>Rather than look at party affiliation or public statements, the researchers &mdash; Alma Cohen, Moshe Hazan, Roberto Tallarita and David Weiss &mdash; looked at the truest measure of political leanings: They followed the money.</p>\n<p>For the study, to be released Tuesday, they tracked personal political contributions for more than 3,500 chief executives that occupied the corner office anytime from 2000 to 2017. The period covers a two-term Republican presidency, a two-term Democratic presidency and the start of President Trump&rsquo;s time in office &mdash; after he lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. In other words, on the whole, voters have been pretty evenly divided between the parties in that time.</p>\n<p>But just 18.4 percent of the executives studied were designated as Democrats.

                "text": "Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters\nThe Business Roundtable, the top lobbying organization for industry in Washington, is often characterized as a nonpartisan or bipartisan organization.\nIt represents more than 200 large companies \u2014 from oil giants to tech sweethearts \u2014 with more than $7 trillion of revenue and more than 15 million workers of all political stripes.\nBut nobody is truly apolitical, and in an age when we increasingly see our business leaders filling the vacuum left by our political leaders, it\u2019s important that the public fully understand the views of these unelected leaders.\nSo a team of researchers working with the Harvard Law School program on corporate governance set out to find the political inclinations of top executives \u2014 not just the 200 who make up the Business Roundtable, but all the executives of the S&P 1500, a stock index that covers 90 percent of the United States\u2019 market capitalization.\nRather than look at party affiliation or public statements, the researchers \u2014 Alma Cohen, Moshe Hazan, Roberto Tallarita and David Weiss \u2014 looked at the truest measure of political leanings: They followed the money.\nFor the study, to be released Tuesday, they tracked personal political contributions for more than 3,500 chief executives that occupied the corner office anytime from 2000 to 2017. The period covers a two-term Republican presidency, a two-term Democratic presidency and the start of President Trump\u2019s time in office \u2014 after he lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College. In other words, on the whole, voters have been pretty evenly divided between the parties in that time.\nBut just 18.4 percent of the executives studied were designated as Democrats. The clear majority \u2014 57.7 percent \u2014 demonstrated their affiliation through donations to the Republican Party. Indeed, 75 percent of donations from the median chief executive were directed to Republicans.\nTo be counted a supporter of Republicans or Democrats, executives had to direct at least two-thirds of their donations to candidates affiliated with one party. More than a quarter of the executives studied gave enough to both parties to be classified as \u201cneutral.\u201d This was the landing spot of Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple. Despite his public support for Hillary Clinton in the last election and his backing of a number of progressive causes, he frequently gave money to candidates on both sides of the aisle.\n(Unfortunately, the researchers have not disclosed how they classified each executive, saying they wanted to focus on the whole, and not the parts. When I asked for an example, they provided me with Mr. Cook.)\nIt is to be expected that leaders of large businesses side with Republicans, given the party\u2019s platform of lower taxes and less regulation. But the overwhelming nature of the support for the G.O.P. is surprising, given the outspoken positions a number of executives have taken in recent years on social issues like climate change, guns and immigration policies.\nThe results of this political science experiment has significant implications given how involved the business community has become in creating and influencing laws and public policy.\n\u201cEspecially since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United, which allowed corporations to make unlimited independent political expenditures, corporate political spending can substantially affect politics and policymaking,\u201d the authors of the report wrote.\nThe researchers dived deeper into some of the numbers to pull apart political leanings by specific industry, company size, region and even the gender of the executive.\nRepublican chief executives clearly outnumbered Democrats in every industry, but the gap narrowed in the \u201cbusiness equipment\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications\u201d sectors, which included technology and internet companies. (Nearly half of business equipment chief executives backed Republicans vs. 30.1 percent for Democrats, and 36.9 percent of telecom chiefs supported Republicans vs. 22.6 percent for Democrats).\nGender differences may be the most surprising. The sample size of women from 2000 to 2017 represented only 2.8 percent of the chief executives (only 1.2 percent in 2000, and 4.4 percent by 2017), but the researchers found that women were nearly evenly split between giving to Republicans, giving to Democrats and giving to both.\nOur political discourse is as divided today as it has been any time since the Civil War. Debates are raging about income inequality, business regulations and capitalism itself \u2014 particularly among Democrats but increasingly among some Republicans.\nThe opinions held by executives have always resonated beyond their own industries, but their importance is more pronounced today. Mr. Trump, for example, has not hesitated to equate economic policy with foreign policy. It is, then, instructive to understand the political views of our business leaders.\nThese executives wield enormous influence over not just policy, but the inclinations of their own employees. One of the most fascinating revelations of the study was that it also looked at the conduct of the businesses themselves, and in the process discovered that disclosures of political donations were highly correlated with the political leaning of its chief executive.\nPolitical contributions by public companies do not have to be disclosed to shareholders, although some of companies do it. So the researchers looked instead at the which companies disclosed the donations to shareholders. Using an index developed by the Center for Political Accountability, the professors found that there was \u201ca statistically significant association between having a Republican C.E.O. and a lower\u201d disclosure score.\nAgain, maybe that should be expected. Republicans typically argue against regulations, so the idea of voluntary disclosure might seem anathema to them. But for shareholders of all political leanings who rely on transparency and disclosure, the politics of a chief executive might be a more important factor than expected. Interestingly, \u201chaving a female C.E.O. is associated with increased transparency\u201d about political contributions, the researchers found.\nThe researchers opted not to conveniently classify executives for us, and perhaps that\u2019s for the best. Political views do change over time, and depending on the candidates involved.\nMr. Cook, for example, backed Mrs. Clinton and several state Democratic committees before the 2016 election. He also donated to the Republican House speaker, Paul Ryan.\nIt\u2019s up to you whether that affects how you vote with your dollars, of course. But now, more than ever, it\u2019s worth knowing where the powerful figures in the business world are placing their bets.",

It has 250,000 hours of political video that we&rsquo;ve covered since 1987.</p>\n<p>That means a member of Congress can pull a clip from their hearing and send it out to constituents. It also means that people on social media or late-night comedians have immediate access to this.</p>\n<p>I think most people who are in their 20s or younger, if they have an experience with C-Span it is through social media, it is through the late-night comedians. The creation of our video library in 1987 was every bit as significant as the original creation of C-Span.</p>\n<p><strong>C-Span has long fought for cameras to be allowed in the Supreme Court chamber. What are the chances that you&rsquo;ll succeed?</strong></p>\n<p>I feel a little bit like it&rsquo;s Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill. What we have documented over the years is that when people are nominated to the Supreme Court they go into their committee hearings expressing their open mind to the concept, and then once they get inside that chamber of nine, they manage to be convinced by the others there that it would be detrimental to the institution.</p>\n<p>We keep hoping that as the generations change and younger appointees come in who are very familiar with media and even social media, that the attitude will change. But the institution continues to prevail.</p>",

It also means that people on social media or late-night comedians have immediate access to this.\nI think most people who are in their 20s or younger, if they have an experience with C-Span it is through social media, it is through the late-night comedians. The creation of our video library in 1987 was every bit as significant as the original creation of C-Span.\nC-Span has long fought for cameras to be allowed in the Supreme Court chamber. What are the chances that you\u2019ll succeed?\nI feel a little bit like it\u2019s Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill. What we have documented over the years is that when people are nominated to the Supreme Court they go into their committee hearings expressing their open mind to the concept, and then once they get inside that chamber of nine, they manage to be convinced by the others there that it would be detrimental to the institution.\nWe keep hoping that as the generations change and younger appointees come in who are very familiar with media and even social media, that the attitude will change. But the institution continues to prevail.",

(An acre-foot is the volume of one foot of water over one acre, about 325,000 gallons.)</p>\n<p>Beyond that drain, climate change is bringing on a long-term crisis. &ldquo;The Colorado River, and the entire Southwest, has shifted to a new hotter and drier climate, and, equally important, will continue to shift to a hotter and drier climate for several decades after we stop emitting greenhouse gases,&rdquo; he said in his testimony.</p>\n<p>In an interview, Mr. Udall said the influence of climate change was already apparent in the West. &ldquo;Climate change is not some distant process,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here, it&rsquo;s now, it&rsquo;s in our faces. It&rsquo;s creating messes we have to deal with.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jonathan T. Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan, said that politicians and policymakers needed to factor climate change into their plans. Lack of river water will lead people to pump more groundwater, which was deposited in the ice ages. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re using this fossil groundwater in unsustainable ways,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In a warming world, Dr. Overpeck said, less water in rivers and lakes is inevitable, whatever relief a wet season might bring. But for the most part, Western political leaders &ldquo;don&rsquo;t want to talk about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is the disaster that&rsquo;s over the horizon, if we don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For more news on climate and the environment, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nytclimate\">follow @NYTClimate on Twitter</a>.</p>",

(An acre-foot is the volume of one foot of water over one acre, about 325,000 gallons.)\nBeyond that drain, climate change is bringing on a long-term crisis. \u201cThe Colorado River, and the entire Southwest, has shifted to a new hotter and drier climate, and, equally important, will continue to shift to a hotter and drier climate for several decades after we stop emitting greenhouse gases,\u201d he said in his testimony.\nIn an interview, Mr. Udall said the influence of climate change was already apparent in the West. \u201cClimate change is not some distant process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s here, it\u2019s now, it\u2019s in our faces. It\u2019s creating messes we have to deal with.\u201d\nJonathan T. Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan, said that politicians and policymakers needed to factor climate change into their plans. Lack of river water will lead people to pump more groundwater, which was deposited in the ice ages. \u201cWe\u2019re using this fossil groundwater in unsustainable ways,\u201d he said.\nIn a warming world, Dr. Overpeck said, less water in rivers and lakes is inevitable, whatever relief a wet season might bring. But for the most part, Western political leaders \u201cdon\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the disaster that\u2019s over the horizon, if we don\u2019t talk about it.\u201d\nFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.",

As many as one in seven American women experience depression during or after pregnancy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Postpartum depression is a serious condition that, when severe, can be life-threatening,&rdquo; Dr. Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products at the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This approval marks the first time a drug has been specifically approved to treat postpartum depression, providing an important new treatment option.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong><em>[</em></strong><strong><a href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\"><em>Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><em>| Sign up for the </em><strong><a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\"><em>Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>There are limitations to the new drug, brexanolone, which will be marketed as Zulresso. It is delivered by infusion over 60 hours, during which a new mother must remain in a certified medical center, under supervision should she get dizzy or faint, as several patients did in clinical trials.</p>\n<p>The infusion will be expensive, averaging $34,000 per patient before discounts, according to Sage Therapeutics, the manufacturer. That does not include the costs of staying in a medical center for two and a half days. Company officials say they expect that insurers will cover the treatment; insurers said this week that they are evaluating the drug.</p>\n<p>A pill made with a similar molecule, which would be much more accessible and easier for patients, is <a href=\"https://investor.sagerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sage-therapeutics-announces-sage-217-meets-primary-and-secondary\">showing promise in its clinical trials</a> and would be submitted for approval in a couple of years if the results are good, according to Sage.</p>\n<p>The infusion is to be administered just once, and patients may also take standard antidepressants. Clinical trials of the drug, all sponsored by Sage, found that it <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31551-4/fulltext\">produced a steeper decrease in symptoms in women with severe and moderate postpartum depression</a> than a similar placebo infusion.</p>\n<p>The relief from depression continued for a month after the treatment. While there were anecdotal reports that it extended beyond that period for some women, there has not been systematic research on longer-term results.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The major thing is, of course, the rapid effect,&rdquo; said Dr. Margaret Spinelli, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who treats and studies <a href=\"https://parenting.nytimes.com/health/postpartum-depression\">postpartum depression</a> and was not involved in the research on brexanolone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That it&rsquo;s the first that&rsquo;s designed for postpartum depression is important and means it will probably be a segue to design other medications for postpartum depression to be administered in an easier way,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>The treatment may be helpful for up to 30 percent of the 400,000 American women who develop postpartum depression each year, said Dr. Kimberly Yonkers, a professor of psychiatry, obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale, who was not involved in the research.</p>\n<p>Candidates for treatment would likely be those experiencing severe symptoms or who failed to improve on standard antidepressants, said Dr. Yonkers, who was not involved in the research.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This brings up a lot of very complex public health issues,&rdquo; she added, noting the expense of the treatment and the need for patients to be admitted to medical centers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It may be worth it, if somebody has been treatment-resistant or they can&rsquo;t wait the two to four weeks for an antidepressant to kick in,&rdquo; Dr. Yonkers said. &ldquo;Depression can be pretty miserable,&rdquo; she added, harming the entire family.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Hathaway, 33, a mother of two in South Windsor, Conn., had no history of depression. But after giving birth to her daughters &mdash; Hadley, 4, and Brenley, 2 &mdash; she began crying nonstop, and lost interest in doing things she loved, like cooking and socializing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I started having intrusive thoughts that would not go away,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;&lsquo;Your daughter deserves a better mom, and your husband deserves a better wife&rsquo; &mdash; that would just play on repeat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ultimately Ms. Hathaway felt suicidal and feared she would harm herself if she stopped holding the baby. After Hadley&rsquo;s birth, Ms. Hathaway, then living with her husband in China, spent two weeks under round-the-clock suicide watch at home.</p>\n<p>The antidepressant she was prescribed, Zoloft, took three months, at increasing dosages, to eliminate her symptoms. Following Brenley&rsquo;s birth, Zoloft didn&rsquo;t help at all, Ms. Hathaway said, so about five months afterward, she volunteered for the brexanolone trial.</p>\n<p>Between 12 and 18 hours after the infusion started, &ldquo;I actually woke up from a nap and those intrusive thoughts that played on repeat, they were gone,&rdquo; said Ms. Hathaway.</p>\n<p>After leaving the hospital, &ldquo;I felt like myself again,&rdquo; Ms. Hathaway said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to say I was 100 percent, but I will say there was so much less of a gap to get there.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She did not stop antidepressants altogether, but switched to a low dose of Effexor.</p>\n<p>Dizziness and sleepiness were the most common side effects in the trials, each affecting about one in eight patients, including Ms. Hathaway. The most worrisome effect, the F.D.A. said, was fainting or temporary loss of consciousness, seen in five patients. All recovered within an hour and resumed getting the infusion.</p>\n<p>Brexanolone is a synthetic form of allopregnanolone, a hormone produced by progesterone in the brain that may help ease depression and anxiety by dampening neural activity, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was the principal investigator for the brexanolone studies.</p>\n<p>The research presented to the F.D.A. consisted of three clinical trials that were led by Dr. Meltzer-Brody and funded by Sage Therapeutics, which was also involved in the study design, data analysis, interpretation and writing of the reports.</p>\n<p>The trials involved 247 women randomly selected to receive a placebo or brexanolone &mdash; a relatively small number of participants, compared to many other medical trials.</p>\n<p>Still, the results were considered persuasive by a joint F.D.A. advisory committee last year, which recommended approval in near-unanimous votes.</p>\n<p>The women in the trials had given birth within six months of getting the infusion and were experiencing severe or moderate depression that had started in the third trimester of pregnancy or within four weeks after childbirth. Participants could not have psychosis or bipolar disorder. Their symptoms could include suicidal thoughts but not a recent suicide attempt.</p>\n<p>They were asked to stop breast-feeding during the infusion and for a few days after. But Dr. Meltzer-Brody said the drug appears safe for nursing mothers and babies, because very little of it seeps into breast milk.</p>\n<p>Depression improved in the women receiving brexanolone and in those receiving placebo, a phenomenon common in studies of depression treatments. But more women in the brexanolone group showed improvement, and their improvement was more substantial.</p>\n<p>In one trial, severely depressed women started with scores of about 28 out of 30 on the Hamilton Depression Scale, a standard evaluation tool. After the infusions, the placebo group averaged about 14 while the brexanolone groups averaged at 9 or 10.</p>\n<p>A person with a score of 7 or below is considered to be virtually without depressive symptoms. About twice as many women on brexanolone achieved that status, Dr. Meltzer-Brody said.</p>\n<p>After a month, more brexanolone patients managed to keep depressive symptoms at bay, compared to those who received placebos. But in a study of moderately depressed women, those receiving placebos reported feeling as good as the brexanolone patients after 30 days.</p>\n<p>That may mean that standard antidepressants finally began kicking in, Dr. Spinelli said. Or perhaps the subjects simply improved on their own.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have more data to understand what happens in a larger population after 30 days,&rdquo; Dr. Meltzer-Brody said.</p>\n<p>Dr. Jeff Jonas, the chief executive of Sage, who trained as a psychiatrist, said he believed the infusion would initially be delivered in hospitals, but &ldquo;we are talking to family practitioners, we are looking at pediatricians, ob-gyns.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dr. Jonas said the experimental pill, given for two weeks in the clinical trials, seems to offer the same benefit as the infusion. It is being tested for treatment of major depression in addition to postpartum depression.</p>",

                "text": "Monica Jorge for The New York Times\nThe first drug for women suffering postpartum depression received federal approval on Tuesday, a move likely to pave the way for a wave of treatments to address a debilitating condition that is the most common complication of pregnancy.\nThe drug works very quickly, within 48 hours \u2014 a significant improvement over currently available antidepressants, which can take two to four weeks to have an effect, if they work at all.\nExperts say the new treatment will provide immediate relief for mothers whose depression keeps them from providing their babies with the care, bonding and nurturing that is crucial for healthy development. As many as one in seven American women experience depression during or after pregnancy.\n\u201cPostpartum depression is a serious condition that, when severe, can be life-threatening,\u201d Dr. Tiffany Farchione, acting director of the Division of Psychiatry Products at the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.\n\u201cThis approval marks the first time a drug has been specifically approved to treat postpartum depression, providing an important new treatment option.\u201d\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\nThere are limitations to the new drug, brexanolone, which will be marketed as Zulresso. It is delivered by infusion over 60 hours, during which a new mother must remain in a certified medical center, under supervision should she get dizzy or faint, as several patients did in clinical trials.\nThe infusion will be expensive, averaging $34,000 per patient before discounts, according to Sage Therapeutics, the manufacturer. That does not include the costs of staying in a medical center for two and a half days. Company officials say they expect that insurers will cover the treatment; insurers said this week that they are evaluating the drug.\nA pill made with a similar molecule, which would be much more accessible and easier for patients, is showing promise in its clinical trials and would be submitted for approval in a couple of years if the results are good, according to Sage.\nThe infusion is to be administered just once, and patients may also take standard antidepressants. Clinical trials of the drug, all sponsored by Sage, found that it produced a steeper decrease in symptoms in women with severe and moderate postpartum depression than a similar placebo infusion.\nThe relief from depression continued for a month after the treatment. While there were anecdotal reports that it extended beyond that period for some women, there has not been systematic research on longer-term results.\n\u201cThe major thing is, of course, the rapid effect,\u201d said Dr. Margaret Spinelli, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who treats and studies postpartum depression and was not involved in the research on brexanolone.\n\u201cThat it\u2019s the first that\u2019s designed for postpartum depression is important and means it will probably be a segue to design other medications for postpartum depression to be administered in an easier way,\u201d she added.\nThe treatment may be helpful for up to 30 percent of the 400,000 American women who develop postpartum depression each year, said Dr. Kimberly Yonkers, a professor of psychiatry, obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale, who was not involved in the research.\nCandidates for treatment would likely be those experiencing severe symptoms or who failed to improve on standard antidepressants, said Dr. Yonkers, who was not involved in the research.\n\u201cThis brings up a lot of very complex public health issues,\u201d she added, noting the expense of the treatment and the need for patients to be admitted to medical centers.\n\u201cIt may be worth it, if somebody has been treatment-resistant or they can\u2019t wait the two to four weeks for an antidepressant to kick in,\u201d Dr. Yonkers said. \u201cDepression can be pretty miserable,\u201d she added, harming the entire family.\nStephanie Hathaway, 33, a mother of two in South Windsor, Conn., had no history of depression. But after giving birth to her daughters \u2014 Hadley, 4, and Brenley, 2 \u2014 she began crying nonstop, and lost interest in doing things she loved, like cooking and socializing.\n\u201cI started having intrusive thoughts that would not go away,\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018Your daughter deserves a better mom, and your husband deserves a better wife\u2019 \u2014 that would just play on repeat.\u201d\nUltimately Ms. Hathaway felt suicidal and feared she would harm herself if she stopped holding the baby. After Hadley\u2019s birth, Ms. Hathaway, then living with her husband in China, spent two weeks under round-the-clock suicide watch at home.\nThe antidepressant she was prescribed, Zoloft, took three months, at increasing dosages, to eliminate her symptoms. Following Brenley\u2019s birth, Zoloft didn\u2019t help at all, Ms. Hathaway said, so about five months afterward, she volunteered for the brexanolone trial.\nBetween 12 and 18 hours after the infusion started, \u201cI actually woke up from a nap and those intrusive thoughts that played on repeat, they were gone,\u201d said Ms. Hathaway.\nAfter leaving the hospital, \u201cI felt like myself again,\u201d Ms. Hathaway said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say I was 100 percent, but I will say there was so much less of a gap to get there.\u201d\nShe did not stop antidepressants altogether, but switched to a low dose of Effexor.\nDizziness and sleepiness were the most common side effects in the trials, each affecting about one in eight patients, including Ms. Hathaway. The most worrisome effect, the F.D.A. said, was fainting or temporary loss of consciousness, seen in five patients. All recovered within an hour and resumed getting the infusion.\nBrexanolone is a synthetic form of allopregnanolone, a hormone produced by progesterone in the brain that may help ease depression and anxiety by dampening neural activity, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the perinatal psychiatry program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who was the principal investigator for the brexanolone studies.\nThe research presented to the F.D.A. consisted of three clinical trials that were led by Dr. Meltzer-Brody and funded by Sage Therapeutics, which was also involved in the study design, data analysis, interpretation and writing of the reports.\nThe trials involved 247 women randomly selected to receive a placebo or brexanolone \u2014 a relatively small number of participants, compared to many other medical trials.\nStill, the results were considered persuasive by a joint F.D.A. advisory committee last year, which recommended approval in near-unanimous votes.\nThe women in the trials had given birth within six months of getting the infusion and were experiencing severe or moderate depression that had started in the third trimester of pregnancy or within four weeks after childbirth. Participants could not have psychosis or bipolar disorder. Their symptoms could include suicidal thoughts but not a recent suicide attempt.\nThey were asked to stop breast-feeding during the infusion and for a few days after. But Dr. Meltzer-Brody said the drug appears safe for nursing mothers and babies, because very little of it seeps into breast milk.\nDepression improved in the women receiving brexanolone and in those receiving placebo, a phenomenon common in studies of depression treatments. But more women in the brexanolone group showed improvement, and their improvement was more substantial.\nIn one trial, severely depressed women started with scores of about 28 out of 30 on the Hamilton Depression Scale, a standard evaluation tool. After the infusions, the placebo group averaged about 14 while the brexanolone groups averaged at 9 or 10.\nA person with a score of 7 or below is considered to be virtually without depressive symptoms. About twice as many women on brexanolone achieved that status, Dr. Meltzer-Brody said.\nAfter a month, more brexanolone patients managed to keep depressive symptoms at bay, compared to those who received placebos. But in a study of moderately depressed women, those receiving placebos reported feeling as good as the brexanolone patients after 30 days.\nThat may mean that standard antidepressants finally began kicking in, Dr. Spinelli said. Or perhaps the subjects simply improved on their own.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have more data to understand what happens in a larger population after 30 days,\u201d Dr. Meltzer-Brody said.\nDr. Jeff Jonas, the chief executive of Sage, who trained as a psychiatrist, said he believed the infusion would initially be delivered in hospitals, but \u201cwe are talking to family practitioners, we are looking at pediatricians, ob-gyns.\u201d\nDr. Jonas said the experimental pill, given for two weeks in the clinical trials, seems to offer the same benefit as the infusion. It is being tested for treatment of major depression in addition to postpartum depression.",

The change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives.</p>\n<p>The previous arrangement, said Philip Ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have sufficient transparency; it didn&rsquo;t have enough eyes on it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. But after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission.</p>\n<p>In what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html\">50 people were accused</a> in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation&rsquo;s most elite colleges.</p>\n<p>Some students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. They gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.</p>\n<p>This process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university&rsquo;s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising.</p>\n<p>Now, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every college president in America called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: How do we make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen at our school?&rdquo; said Bill Martin, the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. &ldquo;And certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Indeed, at Yale University, where F.B.I. investigators say the longtime women&rsquo;s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, Peter Salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. The Yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit&rsquo;s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive &ldquo;close scrutiny,&rdquo; a university statement said.</p>\n<p>A broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in Division I, the highest level of N.C.A.A. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days.</p>\n<p>Battles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. In those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>But in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer &mdash; often called the Olympic sports &mdash; there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. And the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a &ldquo;recruited walk-on.&rdquo; In nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week&rsquo;s indictments, from Stanford to Texas to Yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on.</p>\n<p>Such applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. But they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes &mdash; it varies from sport to sport &mdash; that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.</p>\n<p>The two daughters of the actress Lori Loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors.</p>\n<p>That choice of sport may not have been an accident. In a sport like women&rsquo;s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (Such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When the rosters are that big, like they are in women&rsquo;s crew, I could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,&rdquo; said Martin, who added that Michigan annually audited team rosters.</p>\n<p>The recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the N.C.A.A.&rsquo;s lowest tier, Division III, where athletic scholarships are forbidden.</p>\n<p>Division III is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country&rsquo;s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. These colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body.</p>\n<p>These small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. There are also allowances for students from the least-populated states.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Admissions is filling all the different buckets,&rdquo; said Wendy Smith, the athletic director at Haverford College, a highly rated institution near Philadelphia. &ldquo;And our athletes are right in there. We are not in any way gaming the system. They are absolutely on par academically.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p>In the Ivy League, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. That can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes&rsquo; families often become the leading donors.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?&rdquo; said Paul Wardlaw, who was the women&rsquo;s tennis coach at Brown University for 14 years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The whole scandal is interesting, and it&rsquo;s human nature to take the easy route,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable.</p>\n<p>Cameron Green, a tight end on the football team at Northwestern University, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to Northwestern and been rejected.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier for athletes to get in, so I know that&rsquo;s hard for regular students,&rdquo; said Green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. &ldquo;A lot of kids I knew were confused when I got in and they didn&rsquo;t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body.</p>\n<p>Because success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white &mdash; nearly 80 percent at some small schools.</p>\n<p>In the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week&rsquo;s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at American colleges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said Michael Reilly, the executive director of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; Reilly added, &ldquo;most campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. But then we have this segment that&rsquo;s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic. If I were on those campuses, I&rsquo;d be sitting down and saying, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s rethink how we&rsquo;re doing this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Kyle Johnson for The New York Times\nA dozen years ago, the University of Washington barred athletic coaches from having contact with anyone in the admissions department.\nWith a move that now seems prescient, two new administrators supervising athletics sought to allay any concerns that coaches could put undue pressure on admissions personnel. The change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives.\nThe previous arrangement, said Philip Ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, \u201cdidn\u2019t have sufficient transparency; it didn\u2019t have enough eyes on it.\u201d\nThe leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. But after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission.\nIn what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated, 50 people were accused in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation\u2019s most elite colleges.\nSome students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. They gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.\nThis process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university\u2019s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising.\nNow, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community.\n\u201cEvery college president in America called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: How do we make sure this doesn\u2019t happen at our school?\u201d said Bill Martin, the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. \u201cAnd certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.\u201d\nIndeed, at Yale University, where F.B.I. investigators say the longtime women\u2019s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, Peter Salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. The Yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit\u2019s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive \u201cclose scrutiny,\u201d a university statement said.\nA broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in Division I, the highest level of N.C.A.A. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days.\nBattles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. In those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around.\nBut in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer \u2014 often called the Olympic sports \u2014 there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. And the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a \u201crecruited walk-on.\u201d In nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week\u2019s indictments, from Stanford to Texas to Yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on.\nSuch applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. But they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes \u2014 it varies from sport to sport \u2014 that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.\nThe two daughters of the actress Lori Loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors.\nThat choice of sport may not have been an accident. In a sport like women\u2019s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (Such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)\n\u201cWhen the rosters are that big, like they are in women\u2019s crew, I could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,\u201d said Martin, who added that Michigan annually audited team rosters.\nThe recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the N.C.A.A.\u2019s lowest tier, Division III, where athletic scholarships are forbidden.\nDivision III is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country\u2019s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. These colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body.\nThese small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. There are also allowances for students from the least-populated states.\n\u201cAdmissions is filling all the different buckets,\u201d said Wendy Smith, the athletic director at Haverford College, a highly rated institution near Philadelphia. \u201cAnd our athletes are right in there. We are not in any way gaming the system. They are absolutely on par academically.\u201d\nThe cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.\nIn the Ivy League, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. That can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes\u2019 families often become the leading donors.\n\u201cYou have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?\u201d said Paul Wardlaw, who was the women\u2019s tennis coach at Brown University for 14 years.\n\u201cThe whole scandal is interesting, and it\u2019s human nature to take the easy route,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.\u201d\nAt many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable.\nCameron Green, a tight end on the football team at Northwestern University, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to Northwestern and been rejected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for athletes to get in, so I know that\u2019s hard for regular students,\u201d said Green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. \u201cA lot of kids I knew were confused when I got in and they didn\u2019t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.\u201d\nThe high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body.\nBecause success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white \u2014 nearly 80 percent at some small schools.\nIn the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week\u2019s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at American colleges.\n\u201cThere is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Michael Reilly, the executive director of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. \u201cIn fact,\u201d Reilly added, \u201cmost campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. But then we have this segment that\u2019s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic. If I were on those campuses, I\u2019d be sitting down and saying, \u2018Let\u2019s rethink how we\u2019re doing this.\u2019\u201d",

They also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger, which Facebook owns.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We think this settlement is historic and will go a long way toward making sure that these types of discriminatory practices can&rsquo;t happen,&rdquo; Sheryl Sandberg, the company&rsquo;s chief operating officer, said in an interview.</p>\n<p>The company said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year and would pay less than $5 million to settle five lawsuits brought by the groups.</p>\n<p>A related complaint by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is pending. A Facebook spokesman said the company was in discussions with the department to resolve the case. A HUD official did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>The change comes with Facebook under pressure on many fronts. On Tuesday, it was on the defensive with the Trump administration after it blocked posts by the White House social media director, Dan Scavino Jr. Facebook later apologized, saying the posts had been mistaken for spam &mdash; but not before President Trump warned on Twitter that &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108028566791471104\">I will be looking into this</a>&rdquo; and declared that Facebook, Google and Twitter &ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108004465121075200\">are sooo on the side</a> of the Radical Left Democrats.&quot;</p>\n<p>And over the last year, Facebook has dealt with scandal after scandal related to the company&rsquo;s data-sharing practices and privacy. In early 2018, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a political research firm, had inappropriately harvested <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html\">information from millions of Facebook profiles</a>, largely because of Facebook&rsquo;s improper stewardship of user data. Facebook has been criticized for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/facebook-hack-data-breach.html\">a data breach</a> late last year, compromising the accounts of millions of users.</p>\n<p>Several news organizations, including The Times and ProPublica, have also reported on the use of Facebook&rsquo;s targeting tools in ways that prevent members of certain groups, like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html\">women</a> or <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/business/facebook-job-ads.html\">workers over 40</a>, from seeing ads.</p>\n<p>Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, praised the changes but cautioned against overstating their significance.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Taking the explicit ability to discriminate off the table is an important first step,&rdquo; Professor Kim said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ads.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Kim said, for example, that an employer could place an ad that it intended to show to both men and women, but over time, Facebook&rsquo;s algorithms could begin to show the ad primarily to men if it determined that men were much likelier to click on the ad.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s within the realm of possibility depending on how the algorithm is constructed,&rdquo; Professor Kim said. &ldquo;You could end up serving ads, inadvertently, to biased audiences.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Sandberg acknowledged the limits of the policy changes and said Facebook had committed to working with the other parties to find additional ways to root out discrimination. The parties will discuss progress on that front every six months for three years after the changes are rolled out.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In addition to being a historic settlement of five separate lawsuits that will change practices on Facebook and other platforms, it&rsquo;s also notable that we agreed to continue to study the algorithmic effect of ads with Facebook,&rdquo; said Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U.</p>\n<p>Ms. Sandberg did not directly respond when asked whether Facebook would make its <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/media/facebook-advertising-transparency-users.html\">targeting algorithms more transparent</a> to aid this effort.</p>\n<p>For years, Facebook has made the pitch to customers that its wealth of user data &mdash; from birthdays to favorite television shows &mdash; allows it to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time. These capabilities helped Facebook, along with its rival Google, to take in most of the more than $100 billion in annual online ad spending.</p>\n<p>But Facebook&rsquo;s access to the data that powers this revenue model may be starting to dry up. Last year, a new rule in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, forced internet companies to comply with stricter safeguards in handling user information. And as customers become more hesitant to share their own data, Facebook and other digital-media companies are moving to regain their trust through additional protections.</p>\n<p>Now, some of Facebook&rsquo;s efforts to appease critics who complain of discriminatory practices may further chip away at the model.</p>\n<p>In the interview, Ms. Sandberg conceded that the changes could make advertising on Facebook less efficient for some customers who had used the targeting practices &ldquo;in a very fair and nondiscriminatory way,&rdquo; but added, &ldquo;We believe that that was a cost well worth bearing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Under the new approach, Facebook will require advertisers in the areas of housing, employment and credit to use a separate portal that will not include gender or age as targeting options. It will also preclude selecting an affinity group of people interested in a race, ethnicity or religion. The company has generally allowed advertisers seeking to reach members of a race or religion to aim at such affinity groups.</p>\n<p>The company will continue to allow advertisers in other areas to deliver ads on the basis of age, gender or any affinity groups.</p>\n<p>Even in the less sensitive areas, advertisers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/reviewing-targeting-to-ensure-advertising-is-safe-and-civil\">can&rsquo;t exclude</a> groups associated with race, religion or ethnicity from seeing ads. They can only affirmatively aim ads at them.</p>\n<p>Advertisers that deliberately and repeatedly avoid the new portal when placing ads in the three regulated areas will probably face consequences, though the company said it had yet to determine those.</p>\n<p>Facebook and many businesses that have used its platform to designate ad targets by gender, age or race have long maintained that the practice can be legitimate.</p>\n<p>For example, an advertiser might want to show men and women different versions of the same message to test marketing strategies. Some advertisers also say they use Facebook to aim at certain groups &mdash; like young people &mdash; but place similar ads using other media, like the radio or print magazines, to appeal to older people.</p>\n<p>But many legal experts have said that advertisers who engage in this targeting nonetheless faced a serious risk of liability under discrimination laws. Litigation and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges against employers that have used Facebook in this way are proceeding and will be unaffected by the settlement.</p>\n<p>The question of Facebook&rsquo;s own liability, on the other hand, has been murkier. While it is illegal under federal law to publish a discriminatory housing ad, the law typically holds only employers and employment agencies, and not passive ad publishers, culpable for discriminatory job ads. Many state laws are more aggressive.</p>\n<p>On top of this, Facebook has long argued that it enjoys broad immunity under the federal law that shields internet companies from liability over content produced by third parties.</p>\n<p>One possible exception to these defenses would arise if Facebook were more directly involved in developing the ads &mdash; for example, if its algorithms, and not parameters that advertisers choose overtly, were responsible for shaping an ad&rsquo;s audience. The changes announced Tuesday, which do not appear to preclude such targeting, may not save Facebook from liability in these contexts.</p>\n<p>Beyond eliminating the option of aiming housing, employment and credit ads at audiences according to certain demographic characteristics, Facebook will prevent advertisers from marketing to users according to their ZIP code, a practice that could <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin\">enable redlining</a>.</p>\n<p>Facebook is also removing thousands of so-called interest segments, including some that advertisers could use to reach people by characteristics like gender or age, for ads in the three regulated areas. For example, to show how advertisers could keep certain groups from seeing housing ads on Facebook, the National Fair Housing Alliance <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/us/politics/justice-dept-facebook-fair-housing.html\">once created</a> a fictitious ad that excluded groups like &ldquo;corporate moms&rdquo; and &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; mothers.</p>\n<p>Those segments would no longer be available for targeting by housing, employment and credit ads once Facebook carries out the proposed changes.</p>",

                "text": "Joe Raedle/Getty Images\nAfter years of criticism, Facebook announced on Tuesday that it would stop allowing advertisers in key categories to show their messages only to people of a certain race, gender or age group.\nThe company said that anyone advertising housing, jobs or credit \u2014 three areas where federal law prohibits discrimination in ads \u2014 would no longer have the option of explicitly aiming ads at people on the basis of those characteristics.\nThe changes are part of a settlement with groups that have sued Facebook over these practices in recent years, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Fair Housing Alliance and the Communications Workers of America. They also cover advertising on Instagram and Messenger, which Facebook owns.\n\u201cWe think this settlement is historic and will go a long way toward making sure that these types of discriminatory practices can\u2019t happen,\u201d Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, said in an interview.\nThe company said it planned to carry out the changes by the end of the year and would pay less than $5 million to settle five lawsuits brought by the groups.\nA related complaint by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development is pending. A Facebook spokesman said the company was in discussions with the department to resolve the case. A HUD official did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe change comes with Facebook under pressure on many fronts. On Tuesday, it was on the defensive with the Trump administration after it blocked posts by the White House social media director, Dan Scavino Jr. Facebook later apologized, saying the posts had been mistaken for spam \u2014 but not before President Trump warned on Twitter that \u201cI will be looking into this\u201d and declared that Facebook, Google and Twitter \u201care sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats.\"\nAnd over the last year, Facebook has dealt with scandal after scandal related to the company\u2019s data-sharing practices and privacy. In early 2018, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a political research firm, had inappropriately harvested information from millions of Facebook profiles, largely because of Facebook\u2019s improper stewardship of user data. Facebook has been criticized for a data breach late last year, compromising the accounts of millions of users.\nSeveral news organizations, including The Times and ProPublica, have also reported on the use of Facebook\u2019s targeting tools in ways that prevent members of certain groups, like women or workers over 40, from seeing ads.\nPauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, praised the changes but cautioned against overstating their significance.\n\u201cTaking the explicit ability to discriminate off the table is an important first step,\u201d Professor Kim said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it solves the problem of the potential for biased serving of ads.\u201d\nMs. Kim said, for example, that an employer could place an ad that it intended to show to both men and women, but over time, Facebook\u2019s algorithms could begin to show the ad primarily to men if it determined that men were much likelier to click on the ad.\n\u201cIt\u2019s within the realm of possibility depending on how the algorithm is constructed,\u201d Professor Kim said. \u201cYou could end up serving ads, inadvertently, to biased audiences.\u201d\nMs. Sandberg acknowledged the limits of the policy changes and said Facebook had committed to working with the other parties to find additional ways to root out discrimination. The parties will discuss progress on that front every six months for three years after the changes are rolled out.\n\u201cIn addition to being a historic settlement of five separate lawsuits that will change practices on Facebook and other platforms, it\u2019s also notable that we agreed to continue to study the algorithmic effect of ads with Facebook,\u201d said Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U.\nMs. Sandberg did not directly respond when asked whether Facebook would make its targeting algorithms more transparent to aid this effort.\nFor years, Facebook has made the pitch to customers that its wealth of user data \u2014 from birthdays to favorite television shows \u2014 allows it to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time. These capabilities helped Facebook, along with its rival Google, to take in most of the more than $100 billion in annual online ad spending.\nBut Facebook\u2019s access to the data that powers this revenue model may be starting to dry up. Last year, a new rule in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, forced internet companies to comply with stricter safeguards in handling user information. And as customers become more hesitant to share their own data, Facebook and other digital-media companies are moving to regain their trust through additional protections.\nNow, some of Facebook\u2019s efforts to appease critics who complain of discriminatory practices may further chip away at the model.\nIn the interview, Ms. Sandberg conceded that the changes could make advertising on Facebook less efficient for some customers who had used the targeting practices \u201cin a very fair and nondiscriminatory way,\u201d but added, \u201cWe believe that that was a cost well worth bearing.\u201d\nUnder the new approach, Facebook will require advertisers in the areas of housing, employment and credit to use a separate portal that will not include gender or age as targeting options. It will also preclude selecting an affinity group of people interested in a race, ethnicity or religion. The company has generally allowed advertisers seeking to reach members of a race or religion to aim at such affinity groups.\nThe company will continue to allow advertisers in other areas to deliver ads on the basis of age, gender or any affinity groups.\nEven in the less sensitive areas, advertisers can\u2019t exclude groups associated with race, religion or ethnicity from seeing ads. They can only affirmatively aim ads at them.\nAdvertisers that deliberately and repeatedly avoid the new portal when placing ads in the three regulated areas will probably face consequences, though the company said it had yet to determine those.\nFacebook and many businesses that have used its platform to designate ad targets by gender, age or race have long maintained that the practice can be legitimate.\nFor example, an advertiser might want to show men and women different versions of the same message to test marketing strategies. Some advertisers also say they use Facebook to aim at certain groups \u2014 like young people \u2014 but place similar ads using other media, like the radio or print magazines, to appeal to older people.\nBut many legal experts have said that advertisers who engage in this targeting nonetheless faced a serious risk of liability under discrimination laws. Litigation and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges against employers that have used Facebook in this way are proceeding and will be unaffected by the settlement.\nThe question of Facebook\u2019s own liability, on the other hand, has been murkier. While it is illegal under federal law to publish a discriminatory housing ad, the law typically holds only employers and employment agencies, and not passive ad publishers, culpable for discriminatory job ads. Many state laws are more aggressive.\nOn top of this, Facebook has long argued that it enjoys broad immunity under the federal law that shields internet companies from liability over content produced by third parties.\nOne possible exception to these defenses would arise if Facebook were more directly involved in developing the ads \u2014 for example, if its algorithms, and not parameters that advertisers choose overtly, were responsible for shaping an ad\u2019s audience. The changes announced Tuesday, which do not appear to preclude such targeting, may not save Facebook from liability in these contexts.\nBeyond eliminating the option of aiming housing, employment and credit ads at audiences according to certain demographic characteristics, Facebook will prevent advertisers from marketing to users according to their ZIP code, a practice that could enable redlining.\nFacebook is also removing thousands of so-called interest segments, including some that advertisers could use to reach people by characteristics like gender or age, for ads in the three regulated areas. For example, to show how advertisers could keep certain groups from seeing housing ads on Facebook, the National Fair Housing Alliance once created a fictitious ad that excluded groups like \u201ccorporate moms\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d mothers.\nThose segments would no longer be available for targeting by housing, employment and credit ads once Facebook carries out the proposed changes.",

                "html": "<p>WASHINGTON &mdash; President Trump hosted Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, at the White House on Tuesday, and it was something like looking in the mirror.</p>\n<p>Like other authoritarian leaders Mr. Trump has embraced since taking office, Mr. Bolsonaro is an echo of the American president: a brash nationalist whose populist appeal comes partly from his use of Twitter and his history of making crude statements about women, gay people and indigenous groups.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s the Donald Trump of South America,&rdquo; Mr. Trump marveled during a speech to the Farm Bureau in January, noting that Mr. Bolsonaro had been called the &ldquo;Trump of the tropics&rdquo; since taking office this year. &ldquo;Do you believe that? And he&rsquo;s happy with that. If he wasn&rsquo;t, I wouldn&rsquo;t like the country so much. But I like him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At a news conference after the two men held a luncheon meeting, Mr. Trump gushed that &ldquo;I think Brazil&rsquo;s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it&rsquo;s ever been by far.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our trade with Brazil will go substantially up,&rdquo; Mr. Trump predicted earlier in the afternoon, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s one of the things Brazil would like to see.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>United States officials said this week that Mr. Trump appreciated the way <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html\">Mr. Bolsonaro powered his way to victory</a> in Brazil&rsquo;s election by being unabashedly pro-American and declaring repeatedly that he wanted to have a close relationship with Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>In part because of the stylistic similarities between the two leaders, White House officials expressed optimism that Brazil and the United States &mdash; two of the largest economies in the Western Hemisphere &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/world/americas/bolsonaro-brazil-trump.html\">would be able to work through disagreements</a> and forge a closer bond on trade and regional issues in South America, including confronting the political crisis in Venezuela.</p>\n<p>But the warmth displayed between the two leaders at the White House also underscores how Mr. Trump has upended the usual foreign policy traditions established over decades by his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Since taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly confronted and challenged the United States&rsquo; closest democratic allies, including the leaders of Canada, Germany and France, while speaking with glowing admiration about some of the globe&rsquo;s most brutal dictators: Kim Jong-un of North Korea, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Daily Poster\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/29/podcasts/the-daily-album-art/the-daily-album-art-articleInline-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"\"></img></figure>\n<p>Mr. Bolsonaro has long been an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, but he was elected by an ample margin and Brazil is now very much a democracy.</p>\n<p>A former army captain who served for decades in the Brazilian congress, Mr. Bolsonaro vaulted onto the international scene by winning his country&rsquo;s elections last year. He made his first international appearance as president when he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January.</p>\n<p>At the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Bolsonaro pledged that the United States and Brazil would &ldquo;stand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties and respect to traditional family lifestyles, respect to God our creator against the gender ideology or the politically correct attitudes, and against fake news.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A few minutes later, Mr. Trump said he was &ldquo;very proud to hear the president use the term &lsquo;fake news.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In an interview on Fox News on Monday night, Mr. Bolsonaro lashed out at the news media &mdash; much the way Mr. Trump often does &mdash; for what he said were inaccurate representations of his past statements about race and women, including having said at one point that &ldquo;yes, I am homophobic &mdash; and very proud of it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it were all that, I would not at all have been elected president,&rdquo; Mr. Bolsonaro told Shannon Bream of Fox. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a great deal of fake news certainly around &mdash; the Brazilian population has after all learned how to use social media. And they no longer trust or believe the Brazilian mainstream media, which is virtually dominated by the left wing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Bolsonaro insisted that &ldquo;I have nothing against homosexuals or women &mdash; I&rsquo;m not a xenophobe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With Mr. Bolsonaro by his side at the White House, Mr. Trump lashed out at social media companies like Twitter and Facebook, accusing them of being &ldquo;collusive&rdquo; with his critics and discriminating against conservatives and Republicans. Reacting to a lawsuit filed against social media companies by Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican and one of his supporters, Mr. Trump hinted that he was prepared to take action against what he called &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; practices by the companies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Well, we have to do something, I tell you,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re in a certain group, there&rsquo;s discrimination and big discrimination,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see it absolutely on Twitter and Facebook.&rdquo; Mr. Trump also criticized television networks. &ldquo;The incredible thing is that we can win an election and we have such a stacked deck, and that includes networks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro said they discussed the future of Venezuela, and Mr. Trump praised his counterpart for Brazil&rsquo;s humanitarian aid to Venezuela and support for Juan Guaid&oacute;, the self-declared interim president.</p>\n<p>Responding to a question about why sanctions by the United States have so far failed to force Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, the Venezuela&rsquo;s socialist leader, to surrender his grip on the presidency, Mr. Trump said that the United States had still not imposed the toughest sanctions possible.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We really haven&rsquo;t done the really tough sanctions yet,&rdquo; Mr. Trump said. &ldquo;We can do the tough sanctions, and all options are open. We can go a lot tougher if we need to do that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Earlier in the day, the Treasury Department imposed a new round of sanctions against Minerven, Venezuela&rsquo;s state-owned gold-mining company and its president, Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata, as part of its effort to increase pressure to the Maduro government. It accused Minerven of propping up Mr. Maduro through &ldquo;illicit gold operations,&rdquo; including paying independent miners for gold with &ldquo;nearly worthless bol&iacute;vars&rdquo; to sustain the military.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The illegitimate Maduro regime is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected areas and causing deforestation and habitat loss,&rdquo; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.</p>\n<p>Appearing with Mr. Bolsonaro in the Oval Office before their meeting, Mr. Trump said that he knew &ldquo;exactly&rdquo; what he wanted to happen in Venezuela, but he declined to say what that was.

                "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump hosted Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian president, at the White House on Tuesday, and it was something like looking in the mirror.\nLike other authoritarian leaders Mr. Trump has embraced since taking office, Mr. Bolsonaro is an echo of the American president: a brash nationalist whose populist appeal comes partly from his use of Twitter and his history of making crude statements about women, gay people and indigenous groups.\n\u201cThey say he\u2019s the Donald Trump of South America,\u201d Mr. Trump marveled during a speech to the Farm Bureau in January, noting that Mr. Bolsonaro had been called the \u201cTrump of the tropics\u201d since taking office this year. \u201cDo you believe that? And he\u2019s happy with that. If he wasn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t like the country so much. But I like him.\u201d\nAt a news conference after the two men held a luncheon meeting, Mr. Trump gushed that \u201cI think Brazil\u2019s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it\u2019s ever been by far.\u201d\n\u201cOur trade with Brazil will go substantially up,\u201d Mr. Trump predicted earlier in the afternoon, \u201cand that\u2019s one of the things Brazil would like to see.\u201d\nUnited States officials said this week that Mr. Trump appreciated the way Mr. Bolsonaro powered his way to victory in Brazil\u2019s election by being unabashedly pro-American and declaring repeatedly that he wanted to have a close relationship with Mr. Trump.\nIn part because of the stylistic similarities between the two leaders, White House officials expressed optimism that Brazil and the United States \u2014 two of the largest economies in the Western Hemisphere \u2014 would be able to work through disagreements and forge a closer bond on trade and regional issues in South America, including confronting the political crisis in Venezuela.\nBut the warmth displayed between the two leaders at the White House also underscores how Mr. Trump has upended the usual foreign policy traditions established over decades by his predecessors.\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has repeatedly confronted and challenged the United States\u2019 closest democratic allies, including the leaders of Canada, Germany and France, while speaking with glowing admiration about some of the globe\u2019s most brutal dictators: Kim Jong-un of North Korea, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.\nMr. Bolsonaro has long been an apologist for the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, but he was elected by an ample margin and Brazil is now very much a democracy.\nA former army captain who served for decades in the Brazilian congress, Mr. Bolsonaro vaulted onto the international scene by winning his country\u2019s elections last year. He made his first international appearance as president when he attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January.\nAt the White House on Tuesday, Mr. Bolsonaro pledged that the United States and Brazil would \u201cstand side by side in their efforts to ensure liberties and respect to traditional family lifestyles, respect to God our creator against the gender ideology or the politically correct attitudes, and against fake news.\u201d\nA few minutes later, Mr. Trump said he was \u201cvery proud to hear the president use the term \u2018fake news.\u2019\u201d\nIn an interview on Fox News on Monday night, Mr. Bolsonaro lashed out at the news media \u2014 much the way Mr. Trump often does \u2014 for what he said were inaccurate representations of his past statements about race and women, including having said at one point that \u201cyes, I am homophobic \u2014 and very proud of it.\u201d\n\u201cIf it were all that, I would not at all have been elected president,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro told Shannon Bream of Fox. \u201cSo there\u2019s a great deal of fake news certainly around \u2014 the Brazilian population has after all learned how to use social media. And they no longer trust or believe the Brazilian mainstream media, which is virtually dominated by the left wing.\u201d\nMr. Bolsonaro insisted that \u201cI have nothing against homosexuals or women \u2014 I\u2019m not a xenophobe.\u201d\nWith Mr. Bolsonaro by his side at the White House, Mr. Trump lashed out at social media companies like Twitter and Facebook, accusing them of being \u201ccollusive\u201d with his critics and discriminating against conservatives and Republicans. Reacting to a lawsuit filed against social media companies by Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican and one of his supporters, Mr. Trump hinted that he was prepared to take action against what he called \u201cunfair\u201d practices by the companies.\n\u201cWell, we have to do something, I tell you,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re in a certain group, there\u2019s discrimination and big discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cI see it absolutely on Twitter and Facebook.\u201d Mr. Trump also criticized television networks. \u201cThe incredible thing is that we can win an election and we have such a stacked deck, and that includes networks.\u201d\nMr. Trump and Mr. Bolsonaro said they discussed the future of Venezuela, and Mr. Trump praised his counterpart for Brazil\u2019s humanitarian aid to Venezuela and support for Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-declared interim president.\nResponding to a question about why sanctions by the United States have so far failed to force Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Venezuela\u2019s socialist leader, to surrender his grip on the presidency, Mr. Trump said that the United States had still not imposed the toughest sanctions possible.\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t done the really tough sanctions yet,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe can do the tough sanctions, and all options are open. We can go a lot tougher if we need to do that.\u201d\nEarlier in the day, the Treasury Department imposed a new round of sanctions against Minerven, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned gold-mining company and its president, Adrian Antonio Perdomo Mata, as part of its effort to increase pressure to the Maduro government. It accused Minerven of propping up Mr. Maduro through \u201cillicit gold operations,\u201d including paying independent miners for gold with \u201cnearly worthless bol\u00edvars\u201d to sustain the military.\n\u201cThe illegitimate Maduro regime is pillaging the wealth of Venezuela while imperiling indigenous people by encroaching on protected areas and causing deforestation and habitat loss,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.\nAppearing with Mr. Bolsonaro in the Oval Office before their meeting, Mr. Trump said that he knew \u201cexactly\u201d what he wanted to happen in Venezuela, but he declined to say what that was. He said that all options were on the table, including the use of the military.\nAsked about the possibility of joining the United States in a potential military action against Venezuela, Mr. Bolsonaro declined to answer, saying that \u201cthese reserved issues, which may be discussed, if they have not yet, will not become public.\u201d\nMr. Bolsonaro\u2019s visit to Washington received mixed reviews at home, where many Brazilians were outraged to hear him praise the Trump administration\u2019s plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and say a majority of immigrants who head to the United States do not have \u201cgood intentions.\u201d\nThe satire website Sensacionalista mocked Mr. Bolsonaro for concessions announced during the trip: waiving the visa requirement for United States citizens visiting Brazil and agreeing to allow companies from the United States to launch commercial satellites from a base near the Equator.\n\u201cIn exchange for the use of our base and the visa exemption for Americans, the president will come home with a Trump baseball cap,\u201d the article said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually an incredible location when you study it, and when you see it,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, referring to the agreement Mr. Bolsonaro had announced allowing United States companies to launch satellites from a base in Alcantara, along the north coast of Brazil. \u201cWe won\u2019t go into it now, but because of the location, tremendous amounts of money would be saved. To put it very simply, the flights are a lot shorter.\u201d\nBrazil experts in the United States said the visit had gone well and would most likely establish a foundation for closer cooperation between the two largest economies in the Americas.\n\u201cWe can point to the removal of visa restrictions by Brazil on U.S. citizens as a signal that Brazil is working to reduce barriers to engagement,\u201d said Roberta Braga, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center.",

In making his case, Mr. Nunes, a loyal ally of President Trump and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, repeated several common Republican complaints that Twitter has repeatedly denied: that it censors Republicans, &ldquo;shadow bans&rdquo; their accounts and actively helps their opponents.</p>\n<p>Though absorbing criticism comes with the territory for politicians, the complaint described the objectionable tweets from the three users as something &ldquo;that no human being should ever have to bear and suffer in their whole life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To make his case, he cited a wide variety of tweets that included accusations of criminal misconduct, crude jokes at his expense and relatively banal criticism. The complaint says the tweets &ldquo;falsely stated&rdquo; that Mr. Nunes had brought &ldquo;shame&rdquo; to his family and that he was voted &ldquo;Most Likely to Commit Treason&rdquo; in high school, and that one of them included a cartoon image of a sexual act with Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The complaint lists dozens of other tweets he found insulting.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nunes singled out Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who said on Twitter that she would not comment on the lawsuit, and two parody accounts: @DevinNunesMom, which was suspended last year, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devincow\">@DevinCow</a>, which is still active. The complaint says that Ms. Mair coordinated with the anonymous accounts on &ldquo;a vicious defamation campaign&rdquo; but did not offer evidence she was behind them or communicated with them, except for one tweet encouraging people to follow @DevinCow.</p>\n<p>Experts generally say the law protects large internet platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from liability based on what their users publish. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a> says they should not &ldquo;be treated as the publisher or speaker&rdquo; of the content &mdash; allowing the platforms to exist without having to preapprove every post for potential legal issues.</p>\n<p>But the complaint by Mr. Nunes seeks to portray the tweets directed at him as evidence of larger efforts by Twitter to undermine Republicans &mdash; a frequent rallying cry of conservatives. Mr. Nunes was a key figure in the House&rsquo;s Russia investigation, and a frequent target for critics who said he was abusing his authority by impeding investigations to protect Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As part of its agenda to squelch Nunes&rsquo; voice, cause him extreme pain and suffering, influence the 2018 Congressional election, and distract, intimidate and interfere with Nunes&rsquo; investigation into corruption and Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election, Twitter did absolutely nothing,&rdquo; the complaint said.</p>\n<p>Twitter declined to comment on the lawsuit. But in public statements, including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/technology/facebook-twitter-congress.html\">contentious House committee hearings in September</a>, executives have denied any political bias or agendas. Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, told the House committee they had found no difference in the reach of tweets by Democrats and those by Republicans.</p>\n<p>Mr. Nunes repeated the debunked claim that the social network was &ldquo;shadow banning&rdquo; Republicans, including him. Shadow banning &mdash; the act of a platform allowing someone to post but not allowing others to see the post, effectively making them invisible &mdash; became <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/twitter-shadowbanning.html\">a political catch phrase in July</a>, when a Vice News article used the term to characterize a Twitter bug that was affecting some prominent conservatives.</p>\n<p>In fact, the bug affected their accounts only briefly by not showing up on the network&rsquo;s search results when a user searched for their names; the reach of their posts was unaffected. But the assertion was still used by many, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/trump-social-media-conservatives.html\">including Mr. Trump</a>, as evidence of bias against conservatives.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit by Mr. Nunes had the perhaps unintended effect of sharply increasing the reach of @DevinCow, the parody account that had around 1,200 followers before the lawsuit was filed.

He has taken the bait on almost every negative book written about him by a former staff member or a journalist, helping to elevate those tomes to the best-seller lists by declaring, via Twitter, that their authors are &ldquo;a mess!&rdquo; (Cliff Sims), a &ldquo;lowlife&rdquo; (Omarosa Manigault Newman) or an &ldquo;idiot&rdquo; (Bob Woodward).</p>\n<p>Returning fire with fire is part of the president&rsquo;s modus operandi that aides around him have internalized.

He barely worked <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept\">@TheJusticeDept</a> and was either fired/quit, didn&rsquo;t want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn&rsquo;t even know him!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In fact, Mr. Conway withdrew his name from consideration for a top job at the Justice Department, running its civil division, before he ever started. And he has known Mr. Trump for decades, since he lived in Manhattan at Trump World Tower and declined to sit on the condo board, a spot that his wife took in his stead.</p>\n<p>In more recent history, Mr. Conway spent time with Mr. Trump on election night and at the wedding of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in June 2017, when Mr. Trump even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/us/politics/eric-trump-kellyanne-george-conway.html\">commended him on turning down the job</a> because it would have meant reporting to a &ldquo;weak&rdquo; leader, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>\n<p>Since Mr. Conway has become more vocal in his criticism of the president, Mr. Trump has referred to him repeatedly as &ldquo;Mr. Kellyanne Conway&rdquo; and claimed that in his diatribes against the president, he is simply trying to gain attention through the reflected glory of his wife. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1108335293671845888\">Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter</a> that Mr. Conway, &ldquo;often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife&rsquo;s success &amp; angry that I, with her help, didn&rsquo;t give him the job he so desperately wanted.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In an interview, Mr. Conway dismissed the idea that he was coasting off interest in his wife, and said that in the course of a long marriage, it is hard to separate who is responsible for whose fortune and fame.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The way we structured our lives before the campaign, it enabled her to build her business so she could become the campaign manager,&rdquo; said Mr. Conway, who was previously a partner at the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz. &ldquo;I helped in ways that enabled her to go off and be the campaign manager, and go off to the White House in the spring of 2017.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>When the couple relocated its family to Washington from New Jersey, Mr. Conway gave up his partner status at the law firm, which does not have an office in the District of Columbia, and became &ldquo;of counsel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Conway said his motivation to publicly attack the president had been driven, at least in part, by feeling responsible for having played a small role in electing him, even if it was a tangential one of supportive spouse to the campaign manager.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a little bit of guilt there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t my first choice,&rdquo; Mr. Conway added. &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t her first choice. He was the last choice, in terms of the last person standing.&rdquo; But Mr. Conway said his wife was now all-in for the president, much to his chagrin. &ldquo;At this point, yes she is,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Ms. Conway, who led a briefing on Mr. Trump&rsquo;s initiative to stop opioid abuse on Tuesday morning and was set to personally brief the president on the administration&rsquo;s achievements later in the day, declined to comment. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Ms. Conway said she did not share her husband&rsquo;s view of the president&rsquo;s mental health.</p>\n<p>Critics of Mr. Conway have noted that Mr. Trump revealed himself fully during the campaign, and has not changed. What has changed, in fact, is Mr. Conway&rsquo;s view of him.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I had assumed and hoped that the gravity of the office would lead him to something greater,&rdquo; Mr. Conway said. &ldquo;That respect for the office, respect for history and the desire to leave a legacy would lead him to see that there is something beyond himself that he needs to achieve.&rdquo; But Mr. Conway said that &ldquo;on Day 1, his focus on the crowds, it was clear almost instantaneously that he&rsquo;s not capable of it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A lifelong Republican, Mr. Conway said he had not ruled out supporting a Democrat in 2020. &ldquo;It depends on what they say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but under no circumstances would I vote or support Trump.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some followers of the White House&rsquo;s personal dramas believe the Conways are playing both sides and looking for a big payday if Ms. Conway decides to leave the administration. But Mr. Conway said that a Mary Matalin-James Carville-style road show was an unlikely outcome.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I almost wish that were so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is just my way of expressing my views about something I find thoroughly maddening, which is the utter incompetence and mendacity of the president and the administration. I don&rsquo;t end up getting in arguments at home about it.&rdquo;</p>",

And he has known Mr. Trump for decades, since he lived in Manhattan at Trump World Tower and declined to sit on the condo board, a spot that his wife took in his stead.\nIn more recent history, Mr. Conway spent time with Mr. Trump on election night and at the wedding of the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, in June 2017, when Mr. Trump even commended him on turning down the job because it would have meant reporting to a \u201cweak\u201d leader, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nSince Mr. Conway has become more vocal in his criticism of the president, Mr. Trump has referred to him repeatedly as \u201cMr. Kellyanne Conway\u201d and claimed that in his diatribes against the president, he is simply trying to gain attention through the reflected glory of his wife. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that Mr. Conway, \u201coften referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife\u2019s success & angry that I, with her help, didn\u2019t give him the job he so desperately wanted.\u201d\nIn an interview, Mr. Conway dismissed the idea that he was coasting off interest in his wife, and said that in the course of a long marriage, it is hard to separate who is responsible for whose fortune and fame.\n\u201cThe way we structured our lives before the campaign, it enabled her to build her business so she could become the campaign manager,\u201d said Mr. Conway, who was previously a partner at the law firm Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz. \u201cI helped in ways that enabled her to go off and be the campaign manager, and go off to the White House in the spring of 2017.\u201d\nWhen the couple relocated its family to Washington from New Jersey, Mr. Conway gave up his partner status at the law firm, which does not have an office in the District of Columbia, and became \u201cof counsel.\u201d\nMr. Conway said his motivation to publicly attack the president had been driven, at least in part, by feeling responsible for having played a small role in electing him, even if it was a tangential one of supportive spouse to the campaign manager.\n\u201cThere is a little bit of guilt there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some of that.\u201d\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t my first choice,\u201d Mr. Conway added. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t her first choice. He was the last choice, in terms of the last person standing.\u201d But Mr. Conway said his wife was now all-in for the president, much to his chagrin. \u201cAt this point, yes she is,\u201d he said.\nMs. Conway, who led a briefing on Mr. Trump\u2019s initiative to stop opioid abuse on Tuesday morning and was set to personally brief the president on the administration\u2019s achievements later in the day, declined to comment. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Ms. Conway said she did not share her husband\u2019s view of the president\u2019s mental health.\nCritics of Mr. Conway have noted that Mr. Trump revealed himself fully during the campaign, and has not changed. What has changed, in fact, is Mr. Conway\u2019s view of him.\n\u201cI had assumed and hoped that the gravity of the office would lead him to something greater,\u201d Mr. Conway said. \u201cThat respect for the office, respect for history and the desire to leave a legacy would lead him to see that there is something beyond himself that he needs to achieve.\u201d But Mr. Conway said that \u201con Day 1, his focus on the crowds, it was clear almost instantaneously that he\u2019s not capable of it.\u201d\nA lifelong Republican, Mr. Conway said he had not ruled out supporting a Democrat in 2020. \u201cIt depends on what they say,\u201d he said, \u201cbut under no circumstances would I vote or support Trump.\u201d\nSome followers of the White House\u2019s personal dramas believe the Conways are playing both sides and looking for a big payday if Ms. Conway decides to leave the administration. But Mr. Conway said that a Mary Matalin-James Carville-style road show was an unlikely outcome.\n\u201cI almost wish that were so,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just my way of expressing my views about something I find thoroughly maddening, which is the utter incompetence and mendacity of the president and the administration. I don\u2019t end up getting in arguments at home about it.\u201d",

Hutt (a superfan abbreviation for Jabba the Hutt, the &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; gangster who hangs a frozen Han Solo on his wall), the actor John Cleese, Kathryn Janeway (a &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; captain) and someone called John Snow (more on him later).</p>\n<p>The names stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers interns are university students &mdash; depending on which movie or comic you prefer, Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fits that bill &mdash; and also, real human beings.</p>\n<p>A former council economist, Martha Gimbel, who is now research director at Indeed, noticed the names and tweeted about them on Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>Last year&rsquo;s list was pretty impressive, too, it turns out.

Also, who is this &ldquo;John Snow&rdquo; they speak of? Is he the former Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush? An actual intern? Or did the council, in a blow to its nerd cred, misspell the name of the &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; hero Jon Snow?</p>\n<p>The New York Times asked a council spokeswoman to clarify. &ldquo;Have a sense of humor!&rdquo; she replied.</p>\n<p>Funny, that&rsquo;s what people usually say to economists.</p>",

There\u2019s also Aunt May (Peter Parker\u2019s guardian; apparently there are no anti-nepotism rules at the council), J. T. Hutt (a superfan abbreviation for Jabba the Hutt, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d gangster who hangs a frozen Han Solo on his wall), the actor John Cleese, Kathryn Janeway (a \u201cStar Trek\u201d captain) and someone called John Snow (more on him later).\nThe names stuck out because most Council of Economic Advisers interns are university students \u2014 depending on which movie or comic you prefer, Peter Parker is the only one on the list who fits that bill \u2014 and also, real human beings.\nA former council economist, Martha Gimbel, who is now research director at Indeed, noticed the names and tweeted about them on Tuesday afternoon.\nLast year\u2019s list was pretty impressive, too, it turns out. The 2018 report included abbreviated references to a pair of famed \u201cStar Trek\u201d captains, James T. Kirk and Jean-Luc Picard.\nThe White House says it\u2019s all in good fun. The Council of Economic Advisers\u2019 official Twitter account said late Tuesday that the list was an effort to call attention to its intern \u201csuper heroes,\u201d who made \u201csignificant contributions\u201d to the economic report.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Jabba the Hutt is not, in fact, a superhero \u2014 he enslaved Princess Leia and tried to feed Han Solo and Luke Skywalker to a slow-digesting pit monster in the desert. Also, who is this \u201cJohn Snow\u201d they speak of? Is he the former Treasury secretary under President George W. Bush? An actual intern? Or did the council, in a blow to its nerd cred, misspell the name of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d hero Jon Snow?\nThe New York Times asked a council spokeswoman to clarify. \u201cHave a sense of humor!\u201d she replied.\nFunny, that\u2019s what people usually say to economists.",

We came here and joined the Native Americans.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long said that a baby can be lifted out of a cradle anywhere in the world and brought into any home in America, whatever the color of the folks in that household, and they can be raised to be American as any other. And I believe that every one of us, every one of us, is created in God&rsquo;s image.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Lavelle said she asked the question in this northern Iowa town of 5,000 because she worried that anti-immigrant language used in a manifesto written by the suspect in the mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, resembled Mr. King&rsquo;s own talking points. His fumbling answer to a relatively simple query may have done little to allay those concerns, two months after Mr. King, a nine-term Republican with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/steve-king-offensive-quotes.html\">long history of racist comments</a>, was publicly rebuked by members of his own party.</p>\n<p>House Republican leaders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/steve-king-white-supremacy.html\">removed</a> Mr. King from his committee assignments in January, after comments he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/steve-king-trump-immigration-wall.html?module=inline\">made to The New York Times questioned</a> why the phrase &ldquo;white supremacy&rdquo; was considered offensive.

After being asked about the manifesto, Mr. King responded at length. He said the author of the manifesto had expressed as much sympathy for Communist China as white supremacy. &ldquo;The further it went, the more inconsistent it became, and he seems to have mixed and matched ideologies,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Pressed about the overlap between the manifesto&rsquo;s language and his own, Mr. King responded, &ldquo;He also likely used the same words that Mao used.&rdquo;</p>",

He said the author of the manifesto had expressed as much sympathy for Communist China as white supremacy. \u201cThe further it went, the more inconsistent it became, and he seems to have mixed and matched ideologies,\u201d he said.\nPressed about the overlap between the manifesto\u2019s language and his own, Mr. King responded, \u201cHe also likely used the same words that Mao used.\u201d",

The suit, filed by the attorneys general of Washington, D.C., and Maryland, alleges that Mr. Trump&rsquo;s decision to retain ownership of the hotel after he took office violates the Constitution&rsquo;s emoluments clauses.</p>\n<p>During the hearing, Judge Dennis W. Shedd, the panel&rsquo;s senior jurist, suggested the lawsuit seemed to seek to penalize the president for being a successful business executive. &ldquo;You even want him fired from &lsquo;The Apprentice,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; he said, apparently referring to reports that the president benefited from the purchase of rights for the show by government-owned foreign broadcasters.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit, the first of its kind, asserts that Mr. Trump is violating the clauses in the Constitution that restrict federal officials from accepting government-bestowed financial gains or &ldquo;emoluments,&rdquo; other than their salaries. The Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene after a series of rulings against the president by Judge Peter J. Messitte of the United States District Court in Greenbelt, Md.</p>\n<p>Although Judge Messitte limited the case to allegations that Mr. Trump is profiting from foreign- and state-government guests who patronize the Trump International Hotel, he has allowed it to proceed to the evidence-gathering stage over vigorous objections by the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Legal experts said the appeals court judges could make several moves in the president&rsquo;s favor, including allowing the department to appeal the whole case on an emergency basis or sending it back to the lower court with instructions to Judge Messitte to reconsider the merits of some of his decisions.</p>\n<p>The attorneys general for Maryland and the District of Columbia have asserted that the Trump hotel is unfairly siphoning off business and damaging competitors in their jurisdictions. Judge Messitte ruled that they had enough legal standing for the suit to go forward.</p>\n<p>But Hashim M. Mooppan, a deputy assistant attorney general representing the federal government, told the appeals court judges that the president was immune from such claims. &ldquo;This case should be over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The president is unique.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added: &ldquo;He is not any old inferior officer like the postmaster general. They can&rsquo;t point to any basis in either case law or history to subject the president of the United States&rdquo; to such demands.</p>\n<p>The judges suggested that the plaintiffs seemed to have no clear notion of what exactly they wanted Mr. Trump to do, should he be found to have violated the emoluments bans.</p>\n<p>They repeatedly asked Loren AliKhan, the solicitor general for the District of Columbia, whether the local jurisdictions were seeking to force Mr. Trump to sell the hotel, put the asset into a blind trust or simply ban state and foreign government guests at that property.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You filed the lawsuit and you don&rsquo;t even know what actual, real-world relief you think would satisfy your claim of violation,&rdquo; Judge Shedd said.</p>\n<p>When Ms. AliKhan responded that the lower court would decide the proper remedy, Judge Paul V. Niemeyer scoffed: &ldquo;The district court is going to make this up?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The third judge on the panel, A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., focused on what constitutes an illegal emolument. Courts have never before addressed that issue.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs have argued that it should be defined as any government-bestowed profit, gain or advantage, other than a salary. But Judge Quattlebaum asked whether that would force Mr. Trump to sell his Treasury bonds, since the interest constituted profit.</p>\n<p>At a news conference after the hearing, the local attorneys general expressed confidence that they would prevail. Despite the rain of harsh questions, Karl A. Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, said, &ldquo;I did not take anything from their tone.&rdquo;</p>",

The Justice Department asked the appeals court to intervene after a series of rulings against the president by Judge Peter J.

The federal investigation found that a Yale coach gave bogus athletic endorsements to two students, one of whom was admitted to the college, Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, said Tuesday. He said that how well a student performed academically while at Yale would not factor into a disciplinary decision.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When applicants sign their applications, they attest that the contents are true and complete,&rdquo; Mr. Conroy said.</p>\n<p>Even beyond such formal attestations, some ethicists said there was a case for expelling the students who benefited unknowingly from their parents&rsquo; machinations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty common in the law, and it coincides with moral intuitions: If you&rsquo;re the unwitting beneficiary of a fraud, you don&rsquo;t get to keep the benefits,&rdquo; said Brian Leiter, director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of Chicago, who has <a href=\"https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2019/03/first-class-action-lawsuit-filed-in-the-college-admissions-scandal.html\">posted on his philosophy blog</a>, &ldquo;Leiter Reports,&rsquo;&rsquo; about the scandal.</p>\n<p>And children, Professor Leiter said, share a common interest with their parents. Allowing them to acquire a prestigious college degree would reward their parents&rsquo; behavior, even if they had been unaware of it. But he said what to do with students like those at T.M. Landry whose high school administrators had falsified their applications was more difficult, because the school had an interest in raising its own reputation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s entirely on the administrator, probably the penalty shouldn&rsquo;t be exacted on the student,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Messages left with more than three dozen parents and students associated with the alleged scheme were not returned on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>William Singer, the college counselor at the center of the fraud case, expressed sympathy for the children of his former clients who now find themselves facing possible expulsion, his lawyer, Donald H. Heller, said in an interview.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He feels horribly for the distress the kids are going through,&rdquo; Mr. Heller said. Mr. Singer&rsquo;s suggestion, for what it&rsquo;s worth, is that &ldquo;each student should be judged on the student&rsquo;s personal culpability &mdash; as opposed to the conduct of others,&rdquo; the lawyer said.</p>",

Two parents named in the case resigned from the board of trustees of Sage Hill, a private school in Newport Coast, Calif.\n\u201cWe condemn the alleged actions of those implicated in this scandal as they clearly do not reflect our school\u2019s mission, values and vision,\u201d Sage Hill said in a statement, adding that the \u201cconsistent practice has been to recommend against the use of independent college counselors.\u201d\nSome of the students implicated in the case unearthed by federal prosecutors last week appear to have been knowing participants in the fraud.\nBut it was adults who played the dominant roles, with parents, consultants, college officials and athletic coaches under indictment for scheming on behalf of unwitting children.\nIn the court papers, which contain transcripts of conversations between parents and officials at the organization that arranged the bribes, one parent recounted a \u201cglitch\u201d when her son, fraudulently recruited as a track athlete, was asked about the sport by an adviser at orientation.\n\u201cApparently the adviser said something to the effect of, \u2018Oh, so you\u2019re a track athlete?\u2019 And [my son] said, \u2018No.\u2019 Cause, so [my son] has no idea,\u2019\u2019 the transcript reads.\n\u201cI understand, she won\u2019t even know,\u2019\u2019 another parent said, referring to elaborate plans to deceive her daughter about an arrangement to falsify her standardized test score.\nStill, several colleges issued statements this week indicating that students unwittingly associated with the scandal could still be held accountable because they are required to certify, by signing their applications, that they had told the truth.\nAt the University of Texas, for instance, that language reads: \u201cI certify that the information I have provided is complete and correct, and I understand that the submission of false information is grounds for rejection of my application, withdrawal of any offer of acceptance, cancellation of enrollment and/or appropriate disciplinary action.\u201d\nUniversity officials declined to discuss specific cases, citing privacy rules, but they said punishment could be as severe as being expelled or having admission rescinded. The federal investigation found that a Yale coach gave bogus athletic endorsements to two students, one of whom was admitted to the college, Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Yale, said Tuesday. He said that how well a student performed academically while at Yale would not factor into a disciplinary decision.\n\u201cWhen applicants sign their applications, they attest that the contents are true and complete,\u201d Mr. Conroy said.\nEven beyond such formal attestations, some ethicists said there was a case for expelling the students who benefited unknowingly from their parents\u2019 machinations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty common in the law, and it coincides with moral intuitions: If you\u2019re the unwitting beneficiary of a fraud, you don\u2019t get to keep the benefits,\u201d said Brian Leiter, director of the Center for Law, Philosophy and Human Values at the University of Chicago, who has posted on his philosophy blog, \u201cLeiter Reports,\u2019\u2019 about the scandal.\nAnd children, Professor Leiter said, share a common interest with their parents. Allowing them to acquire a prestigious college degree would reward their parents\u2019 behavior, even if they had been unaware of it. But he said what to do with students like those at T.M. Landry whose high school administrators had falsified their applications was more difficult, because the school had an interest in raising its own reputation.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s entirely on the administrator, probably the penalty shouldn\u2019t be exacted on the student,\u201d he said.\nMessages left with more than three dozen parents and students associated with the alleged scheme were not returned on Tuesday.\nWilliam Singer, the college counselor at the center of the fraud case, expressed sympathy for the children of his former clients who now find themselves facing possible expulsion, his lawyer, Donald H. Heller, said in an interview.\n\u201cHe feels horribly for the distress the kids are going through,\u201d Mr. Heller said. Mr. Singer\u2019s suggestion, for what it\u2019s worth, is that \u201ceach student should be judged on the student\u2019s personal culpability \u2014 as opposed to the conduct of others,\u201d the lawyer said.",

In the state of West Virginia, the attorney general has the authority to bring only civil cases, not criminal ones. Law enforcement officials in other states have been stymied by statues of limitation, which have often restricted their ability to prosecute allegations of sexual abuse that happened decades ago.</p>\n<p>Legal experts say that West Virginia&rsquo;s lawsuit is a sign that attorneys general are increasingly trying to find novel ways to address the abuse problem in their states.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What we are going to see is perhaps a broader array of legal avenues to hold the dioceses responsible,&rdquo; Mary G. Leary, a law professor at the Catholic University of America, said of the West Virginia case.</p>\n<p>The West Virginia approach alleges that the diocese and bishop &ldquo;knowingly employed pedophiles&rdquo; at Catholic schools and camps but did not disclose to parents the &ldquo;danger&rdquo; of sending their children to these programs, which advertised safe environments. The suit also says that church officials did not conduct adequate background checks for employees of Catholic schools and camps.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We believe that every parent who paid tuition for a service that falls under consumer protection laws deserves to know the schools their children are attending are safe,&rdquo; the West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey said in a phone interview. &ldquo;The church itself advertised that these children would be in a safe environment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Though the West Virginia lawsuit is in its early stages, the strategy presents a potentially new legal option for law enforcement to seek redress in such cases.</p>\n<p>In the past, church leaders have been sued in civil court with claims of negligence, which some lawyers have seen as a more straightforward strategy. But the consumer protection angle is &ldquo;groundbreaking,&rdquo; and similar to inventive legal approaches in opioid or environmental cases, said Jayne Conroy, a trial lawyer at Simmons Hanly Conroy who has worked on a number of high-profile sex-abuse cases against Catholic institutions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think you are going to see many other attorneys general do the same,&rdquo; Ms. Conroy said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Morrisey&rsquo;s office began its investigation into the church in September, after the explosive Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/catholic-church-sex-abuse-pennsylvania.html\">report</a> last summer alleging that bishops and other church leaders covered up widespread child sexual abuse over several decades. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday says that, in at least five instances over several decades, the diocese put credibly accused priests back into ministry with children or did not conduct proper background checks on school employees.</p>\n<p>In one case, Father Patrick Condron, who was employed at a diocesan school in the 1980s and who later admitted to sexual misconduct against a student, was returned to ministry at an elementary school from 1998 to 2001, without parents of children at the school being informed of his history.</p>\n<p>Mr. Morrisey said that he was seeking a permanent court order to block the Catholic Church from continuing such conduct, and that one goal of the lawsuit was to &ldquo;dramatically increase transparency&rdquo; within the church.</p>\n<p>He did not rule out the possibility of additional criminal action by the state; he said any evidence of criminal wrongdoing would be passed on to appropriate law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p>The diocese of Wheeling-Charleston &ldquo;strongly and unconditionally rejects&rdquo; the lawsuit&rsquo;s allegation that it is not &ldquo;wholly committed&rdquo; to protecting children, a diocesan spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that some of the allegations in the complaint &ldquo;are not accurately described.&rdquo; The findings of the church-led investigation into <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/us/bishop-bransfield-pope-francis.html\">Bishop Michael J. Bransfield</a>, who led the diocese from 2005 to 2018, have not yet been made public.</p>\n<p>Mark E. Chopko, whose firm Stradley Ronon Stevens &amp; Young represents the diocese in West Virginia, pointed out in an email that the lawsuit is administrative, not criminal, and that the state is seeking &ldquo;unspecified&rdquo; fines or civil penalties, rather than building a case to arrest the bishop.</p>\n<p>Religious institutions are not usually subject to rules governing consumer protection, in part because they might be protected by freedom of religion, said Nicholas P. Cafardi, a prominent canon lawyer in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there aren&rsquo;t some First Amendment issues there,&rdquo; Mr. Cafardi said. &ldquo;If the attorney general could convince the courts that this was more than a religious activity, he may have a case.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There is also some ambiguity around whether a priest is definitively an employee of the church. Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York, who was accused of moving around pedophile priests, once argued that the diocese was not liable for their behavior because they were independent contractors. &ldquo;Every priest is self-employed,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/nyregion/cardinal-edward-m-egan-former-archbishop-of-new-york-dies-at-82.html\">testified</a> in 1997.</p>\n<p>Mr. Morrisey said his case does not conflict with the First Amendment. &ldquo;We are not seeking to engage in doctrinal questions of the church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No one is immune from the law, and the church is not immune from consumer protection laws.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At least 15 other state attorneys general have started investigations into the Catholic church since last summer. Mr. Morrisey said he had been in touch with some of them, but declined to say whether other states were considering a similar legal strategy. Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania has discussed the consumer fraud angle with several attorneys general considering action against the church.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to see Attorney General Morrisey taking such an innovative approach to protecting children in West Virginia,&rdquo; Mr. Shapiro said in an email.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit filed on Tuesday says that at least one of the priests named in the Pennsylvania report was also employed for a time in the West Virginia diocese.</p>\n<p>Pope Francis accepted Bishop Bransfield&rsquo;s resignation in September amid allegations that the bishop had sexually harassed adults. American church officials were instructed by the pope to investigate the allegations.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, who has been overseeing the church in West Virginia since Bishop Bransfield&rsquo;s resignation, announced that the preliminary investigation had been completed. He said that Bishop Bransfield would be restricted from ministry in West Virginia and the archdiocese of Baltimore, pending a final judgment by the Vatican.</p>",

The suit also says that church officials did not conduct adequate background checks for employees of Catholic schools and camps.\n\u201cWe believe that every parent who paid tuition for a service that falls under consumer protection laws deserves to know the schools their children are attending are safe,\u201d the West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey said in a phone interview. \u201cThe church itself advertised that these children would be in a safe environment.\u201d\nThough the West Virginia lawsuit is in its early stages, the strategy presents a potentially new legal option for law enforcement to seek redress in such cases.\nIn the past, church leaders have been sued in civil court with claims of negligence, which some lawyers have seen as a more straightforward strategy. But the consumer protection angle is \u201cgroundbreaking,\u201d and similar to inventive legal approaches in opioid or environmental cases, said Jayne Conroy, a trial lawyer at Simmons Hanly Conroy who has worked on a number of high-profile sex-abuse cases against Catholic institutions.\n\u201cI think you are going to see many other attorneys general do the same,\u201d Ms. Conroy said.\nMr. Morrisey\u2019s office began its investigation into the church in September, after the explosive Pennsylvania report last summer alleging that bishops and other church leaders covered up widespread child sexual abuse over several decades. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday says that, in at least five instances over several decades, the diocese put credibly accused priests back into ministry with children or did not conduct proper background checks on school employees.\nIn one case, Father Patrick Condron, who was employed at a diocesan school in the 1980s and who later admitted to sexual misconduct against a student, was returned to ministry at an elementary school from 1998 to 2001, without parents of children at the school being informed of his history.\nMr. Morrisey said that he was seeking a permanent court order to block the Catholic Church from continuing such conduct, and that one goal of the lawsuit was to \u201cdramatically increase transparency\u201d within the church.\nHe did not rule out the possibility of additional criminal action by the state; he said any evidence of criminal wrongdoing would be passed on to appropriate law enforcement officials.\nThe diocese of Wheeling-Charleston \u201cstrongly and unconditionally rejects\u201d the lawsuit\u2019s allegation that it is not \u201cwholly committed\u201d to protecting children, a diocesan spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that some of the allegations in the complaint \u201care not accurately described.\u201d The findings of the church-led investigation into Bishop Michael J. Bransfield, who led the diocese from 2005 to 2018, have not yet been made public.\nMark E. Chopko, whose firm Stradley Ronon Stevens & Young represents the diocese in West Virginia, pointed out in an email that the lawsuit is administrative, not criminal, and that the state is seeking \u201cunspecified\u201d fines or civil penalties, rather than building a case to arrest the bishop.\nReligious institutions are not usually subject to rules governing consumer protection, in part because they might be protected by freedom of religion, said Nicholas P. Cafardi, a prominent canon lawyer in Pennsylvania.\n\u201cI wonder if there aren\u2019t some First Amendment issues there,\u201d Mr. Cafardi said. \u201cIf the attorney general could convince the courts that this was more than a religious activity, he may have a case.\u201d\nThere is also some ambiguity around whether a priest is definitively an employee of the church. Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York, who was accused of moving around pedophile priests, once argued that the diocese was not liable for their behavior because they were independent contractors. \u201cEvery priest is self-employed,\u201d he testified in 1997.\nMr. Morrisey said his case does not conflict with the First Amendment. \u201cWe are not seeking to engage in doctrinal questions of the church,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is immune from the law, and the church is not immune from consumer protection laws.\u201d\nAt least 15 other state attorneys general have started investigations into the Catholic church since last summer. Mr. Morrisey said he had been in touch with some of them, but declined to say whether other states were considering a similar legal strategy. Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania has discussed the consumer fraud angle with several attorneys general considering action against the church.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see Attorney General Morrisey taking such an innovative approach to protecting children in West Virginia,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said in an email.\nThe lawsuit filed on Tuesday says that at least one of the priests named in the Pennsylvania report was also employed for a time in the West Virginia diocese.\nPope Francis accepted Bishop Bransfield\u2019s resignation in September amid allegations that the bishop had sexually harassed adults. American church officials were instructed by the pope to investigate the allegations.\nEarlier this month, Archbishop William E. Lori of Baltimore, who has been overseeing the church in West Virginia since Bishop Bransfield\u2019s resignation, announced that the preliminary investigation had been completed. He said that Bishop Bransfield would be restricted from ministry in West Virginia and the archdiocese of Baltimore, pending a final judgment by the Vatican.",

Amnesty International, in a new report released on Tuesday, put the death toll at 14 since 2017 alone.</p>\n<p>The report linked the killings to President Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/africa/trump-is-said-to-ease-combat-rules-in-somalia-designed-to-protect-civilians.html\">decision to relax rules for preventing civilian casualties</a> during American counterterrorism strikes in Somalia. Amnesty said it examined five airstrikes that killed 14 civilians and injured eight.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In the incidents presented in this report, civilians were killed and injured in attacks that may have violated international humanitarian law and could, in some cases, constitute war crimes,&rdquo; the report said.</p>\n<p>It called into question repeated claims by United States Africa Command that there have been no civilian casualties from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/us/politics/us-somalia-airstrikes-shabab.html\">American strikes against the extremist Islamist group known as the Shabab</a>. The report also attributed the discrepancy to failures by the American military and the Somali government to adequately investigate claims that civilians were killed in airstrikes and raids by United States forces.</p>\n<p>Africa Command disputed the report&rsquo;s findings and maintained it had killed zero civilians in Somalia. &ldquo;Our assessments found that no Africom airstrike resulted in any civilian casualty or injury,&rdquo; the command said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Instead, American military officials said, extremist groups in Somalia are making up casualties and coercing locals to make false claims of civilians killed. &ldquo;Al Shabab and ISIS-Somalia have a history of placing their forces and facilities in and around civilian locations to conceal and shield their activities,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>\n<p>But during a conference call on Tuesday with reporters, Defense Department officials acknowledged that it was difficult to verify civilian casualties because most American airstrikes and raids take place in areas that are controlled by the Shabab.</p>\n<p>Before Mr. Trump took office, the military was generally required to follow standards that President Barack Obama imposed in 2013 for counterterrorism strikes beyond Afghanistan, Iraq and other conventional war zones.</p>\n<p>Those rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance, required high-level interagency vetting of proposed strikes. They also said that the target must pose a threat to Americans and that there must be near certainty that no bystanders would die.</p>\n<p>In March 2017, Mr. Trump signed a directive declaring parts of Somalia an &ldquo;area of active hostilities,&rdquo; where war zone targeting rules would apply.</p>\n<p>Under the new guidelines, Africa Command could treat Somalia under less restrictive battlefield rules. Without interagency vetting, commanders could strike suspected Shabab fighters even without reason to believe they posed a threat to Americans.</p>\n<p>In addition, the guidelines opened the door to permitting some civilian deaths if deemed necessary and proportionate to the threat.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The civilian death toll we&rsquo;ve uncovered in just a handful of strikes suggests the shroud of secrecy surrounding the U.S. role in Somalia&rsquo;s war is actually a smokescreen for impunity,&rdquo; Brian Castner, Amnesty International&rsquo;s senior crisis adviser, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>He called Africa Command&rsquo;s assertions of zero casualties &ldquo;all the more fanciful when you consider the U.S.A. has tripled its airstrikes across the country since 2016, outstripping their strikes in Libya and Yemen combined.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But Amnesty acknowledged that its investigators were also hampered by security concerns. As with Africa Command, that prevented Amnesty from conducting on site interviews and limited aid workers&rsquo; ability to freely gather evidence. The group said it interviewed a total of 142 witnesses and survivors, with 65 who had witnessed strikes where civilian casualties were confirmed.</p>\n<p>In one case, the report cited a drone strike on Oct. 16, 2017, against a Shabab vehicle. The attack missed its target and killed two civilians and injured five, including two children.</p>\n<p>Amnesty called on Africa Command to &ldquo;acknowledge civilian casualties caused by U.S. attacks and offer compensation and explanation to survivors and families of civilians killed in U.S. strikes regardless of whether the casualties were caused by a lawful attack.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2013, the Shabab carried out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/africa/nairobi-mall-shooting.html?module=inline\">an attack at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya</a>, killing more than 60 people and wounding more than 175. Since then, it has adopted more sophisticated forms of terrorism, including nearly bringing down a Somali airliner in 2016 with a bomb hidden in a laptop computer.</p>\n<p>To counter the Shabab, the United States has used Special Operations forces, airstrikes, private contractors and assistance from African allies.</p>",

The report also attributed the discrepancy to failures by the American military and the Somali government to adequately investigate claims that civilians were killed in airstrikes and raids by United States forces.\nAfrica Command disputed the report\u2019s findings and maintained it had killed zero civilians in Somalia. \u201cOur assessments found that no Africom airstrike resulted in any civilian casualty or injury,\u201d the command said in a statement.\nInstead, American military officials said, extremist groups in Somalia are making up casualties and coercing locals to make false claims of civilians killed. \u201cAl Shabab and ISIS-Somalia have a history of placing their forces and facilities in and around civilian locations to conceal and shield their activities,\u201d the statement said.\nBut during a conference call on Tuesday with reporters, Defense Department officials acknowledged that it was difficult to verify civilian casualties because most American airstrikes and raids take place in areas that are controlled by the Shabab.\nBefore Mr. Trump took office, the military was generally required to follow standards that President Barack Obama imposed in 2013 for counterterrorism strikes beyond Afghanistan, Iraq and other conventional war zones.\nThose rules, known as the Presidential Policy Guidance, required high-level interagency vetting of proposed strikes. They also said that the target must pose a threat to Americans and that there must be near certainty that no bystanders would die.\nIn March 2017, Mr. Trump signed a directive declaring parts of Somalia an \u201carea of active hostilities,\u201d where war zone targeting rules would apply.\nUnder the new guidelines, Africa Command could treat Somalia under less restrictive battlefield rules. Without interagency vetting, commanders could strike suspected Shabab fighters even without reason to believe they posed a threat to Americans.\nIn addition, the guidelines opened the door to permitting some civilian deaths if deemed necessary and proportionate to the threat.\n\u201cThe civilian death toll we\u2019ve uncovered in just a handful of strikes suggests the shroud of secrecy surrounding the U.S. role in Somalia\u2019s war is actually a smokescreen for impunity,\u201d Brian Castner, Amnesty International\u2019s senior crisis adviser, said in a statement.\nHe called Africa Command\u2019s assertions of zero casualties \u201call the more fanciful when you consider the U.S.A. has tripled its airstrikes across the country since 2016, outstripping their strikes in Libya and Yemen combined.\u201d\nBut Amnesty acknowledged that its investigators were also hampered by security concerns. As with Africa Command, that prevented Amnesty from conducting on site interviews and limited aid workers\u2019 ability to freely gather evidence. The group said it interviewed a total of 142 witnesses and survivors, with 65 who had witnessed strikes where civilian casualties were confirmed.\nIn one case, the report cited a drone strike on Oct. 16, 2017, against a Shabab vehicle. The attack missed its target and killed two civilians and injured five, including two children.\nAmnesty called on Africa Command to \u201cacknowledge civilian casualties caused by U.S. attacks and offer compensation and explanation to survivors and families of civilians killed in U.S. strikes regardless of whether the casualties were caused by a lawful attack.\u201d\nIn 2013, the Shabab carried out an attack at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing more than 60 people and wounding more than 175. Since then, it has adopted more sophisticated forms of terrorism, including nearly bringing down a Somali airliner in 2016 with a bomb hidden in a laptop computer.\nTo counter the Shabab, the United States has used Special Operations forces, airstrikes, private contractors and assistance from African allies.",

In areas near the rivers, homes were submerged, with water rising near the tops of telephone poles.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We took an aerial survey, and as far as the eye can see, there was flooding, and deep as well,&rdquo; said Jamie LeSueur, who was leading rescue efforts in central Mozambique for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. &ldquo;What we are now facing is large-scale flooding on top of an area already devastated by the cyclone.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"An area outside the coastal city of Beira in central Mozambique on Tuesday.\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/world/19mozambique/merlin_152305197_3e744666-80c4-4be9-a6c7-b728e709dbd4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/world/19mozambique/merlin_152305197_3e744666-80c4-4be9-a6c7-b728e709dbd4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/world/19mozambique/merlin_152305197_3e744666-80c4-4be9-a6c7-b728e709dbd4-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/world/19mozambique/merlin_152305197_3e744666-80c4-4be9-a6c7-b728e709dbd4-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1280w\"></img></figure>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/world/africa/cyclone-idai-mozambique.html\">storm swept across Mozambique on Thursday night</a> before turning inland into neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe. It is believed to have affected more than 1.5 million people in the three nations.</p>\n<p>The countries, among the world&rsquo;s poorest, have limited capacity to respond to the disaster, and officials called for outside help. Relief officials warned that delays in reaching survivors could lead to an outbreak of illnesses, including cholera and malaria.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This cyclone has come at a very huge human cost,&rdquo; Nick Mangwana, a spokesman for the Zimbabwean government, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickmangwana/status/1107874903439609856?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">said on Twitter</a>. &ldquo;We certainly need a regional approach to these effects of global warming. These problems are transnational.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Mozambique, several aid agencies focused their efforts on Beira, a port city of half a million people that was all but destroyed by the storm. A cargo plane loaded with emergency supplies was able to land at the airport there, but aid groups struggled to distribute the goods to affected areas.</p>\n<p><em>[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/world/africa/cyclone-idai-mozambique.html\"><em>Cyclone Idai explained: What happened and what&rsquo;s being don</em></a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/world/africa/mozambique-cyclone-rescue.html\"><em>e</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>The main highway into the city remained impassable, while secondary roads were being cleared of fallen trees and other debris, said Saul Butters, CARE&rsquo;s assistant director for Mozambique.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We have 13 articulated trucks that are unable to get into the city,&rdquo; Mr. Butters said, adding that the agency was now organizing airlifts by helicopter.</p>\n<p>Until isolated communities are reached, relief workers said, it is impossible to estimate the number of casualties. The official death toll in Mozambique was 84, though President Filipe Nyusi said on Monday that it could climb to more than 1,000.</p>\n<p>Beira, which is Mozambique&rsquo;s fourth-largest city and faces the Indian Ocean, remained without electricity and telephone service on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>After hitting Beira on Thursday night, the cyclone moved the next day into Chimanimani, a rural district in Zimbabwe near the border with Mozambique.</p>\n<p>Officials at Doctors Without Borders said they had been unable to reach Chimanimani because of destroyed roads and bridges, but the group was providing services at a center outside the area.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday in Chimanimani, burials were held for some of the victims of the storm.</p>\n<p>Absalom Makanga, a leader of the Salvation Church in Chimanimani, said by phone that 40 victims in a low-income area called Ngangu had been buried.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our resident pastor officiated at the burials because we could not get there because of the poor state of the roads destroyed by the cyclone,&rdquo; Mr. Makanga said.</p>\n<p>Rutendo Rukavi, a volunteer who was helping the flood victims in Chimanimani, said that she had witnessed makeshift burials for the dead, including for an 83-year-old man.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was sad,&rdquo; Ms. Rukavi said. &ldquo;People were just being buried in the midst of the debris that remained of their homes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Malawi, heavy rains have caused severe flooding in 14 southern districts near the Mozambican border, including Chikwawa and Nsanje.</p>\n<p>In Chikwawa, the worst-affected area, nine people have died and more than 54,000 people have been displaced.</p>\n<p>Lusizi Mshani, district commissioner for Chikwawa, said by phone that the displaced were staying in severely overcrowded government-run camps, each holding about 5,000 people.</p>\n<p>Mr. Mshani said that most people affected by the floods had now been moved to the camps.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The water level has gone down, and people in the lower areas have been moved to higher ground,&rdquo; he said. But, he said, the displaced were now in desperate need of new shelter, food, clean water and medicine.</p>",

                "text": "MAPUTO, Mozambique \u2014 Rescue workers struggled Tuesday to reach areas devastated by a huge cyclone in Mozambique, as heavy rains swelled rivers and further isolated flooded communities in what aid agencies called the worst natural disaster in southern Africa in two decades.\nIn central Mozambique, the area hit hardest by Cyclone Idai, overflowing rivers created \u201can inland ocean\u201d where countless people were still marooned, a United Nations official said.\nRescue workers reported seeing people on rooftops and in trees days after the storm struck. In areas near the rivers, homes were submerged, with water rising near the tops of telephone poles.\n\u201cWe took an aerial survey, and as far as the eye can see, there was flooding, and deep as well,\u201d said Jamie LeSueur, who was leading rescue efforts in central Mozambique for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \u201cWhat we are now facing is large-scale flooding on top of an area already devastated by the cyclone.\u201d\nThe storm swept across Mozambique on Thursday night before turning inland into neighboring Malawi and Zimbabwe. It is believed to have affected more than 1.5 million people in the three nations.\nThe countries, among the world\u2019s poorest, have limited capacity to respond to the disaster, and officials called for outside help. Relief officials warned that delays in reaching survivors could lead to an outbreak of illnesses, including cholera and malaria.\n\u201cThis cyclone has come at a very huge human cost,\u201d Nick Mangwana, a spokesman for the Zimbabwean government, said on Twitter. \u201cWe certainly need a regional approach to these effects of global warming. These problems are transnational.\u201d\nIn Mozambique, several aid agencies focused their efforts on Beira, a port city of half a million people that was all but destroyed by the storm. A cargo plane loaded with emergency supplies was able to land at the airport there, but aid groups struggled to distribute the goods to affected areas.\n[Cyclone Idai explained: What happened and what\u2019s being done.]\nThe main highway into the city remained impassable, while secondary roads were being cleared of fallen trees and other debris, said Saul Butters, CARE\u2019s assistant director for Mozambique.\n\u201cWe have 13 articulated trucks that are unable to get into the city,\u201d Mr. Butters said, adding that the agency was now organizing airlifts by helicopter.\nUntil isolated communities are reached, relief workers said, it is impossible to estimate the number of casualties. The official death toll in Mozambique was 84, though President Filipe Nyusi said on Monday that it could climb to more than 1,000.\nBeira, which is Mozambique\u2019s fourth-largest city and faces the Indian Ocean, remained without electricity and telephone service on Tuesday.\nAfter hitting Beira on Thursday night, the cyclone moved the next day into Chimanimani, a rural district in Zimbabwe near the border with Mozambique.\nOfficials at Doctors Without Borders said they had been unable to reach Chimanimani because of destroyed roads and bridges, but the group was providing services at a center outside the area.\nOn Tuesday in Chimanimani, burials were held for some of the victims of the storm.\nAbsalom Makanga, a leader of the Salvation Church in Chimanimani, said by phone that 40 victims in a low-income area called Ngangu had been buried.\n\u201cOur resident pastor officiated at the burials because we could not get there because of the poor state of the roads destroyed by the cyclone,\u201d Mr. Makanga said.\nRutendo Rukavi, a volunteer who was helping the flood victims in Chimanimani, said that she had witnessed makeshift burials for the dead, including for an 83-year-old man.\n\u201cIt was sad,\u201d Ms. Rukavi said. \u201cPeople were just being buried in the midst of the debris that remained of their homes.\u201d\nIn Malawi, heavy rains have caused severe flooding in 14 southern districts near the Mozambican border, including Chikwawa and Nsanje.\nIn Chikwawa, the worst-affected area, nine people have died and more than 54,000 people have been displaced.\nLusizi Mshani, district commissioner for Chikwawa, said by phone that the displaced were staying in severely overcrowded government-run camps, each holding about 5,000 people.\nMr. Mshani said that most people affected by the floods had now been moved to the camps.\n\u201cThe water level has gone down, and people in the lower areas have been moved to higher ground,\u201d he said. But, he said, the displaced were now in desperate need of new shelter, food, clean water and medicine.",

                "text": "Adam Dean for The New York Times\nOne was a dairy farmer. Another aspired to be a pilot. One was an elder known for helping newcomers. Another was a teenager who called his mother when the shooting started. The 50 people slaughtered by a gunman at two Christchurch mosques last week spanned a range of backgrounds. Here is what we know about them.\nAtta Elayyan\nImage\nAtta Elayyan, 33, was a technology entrepreneur, a goalkeeper and a new father. He played for New Zealand\u2019s national futsal team, according to the New Zealand Football association, which confirmed his death. Futsal is a version of five-a-side soccer played indoors.\n\u201cThere are no words to sum up how we are all feeling,\u201d one of his teammates, Josh Margetts, said in a statement. \u201cThere is a huge hole in our hearts as we come to terms with the loss of a great person and a good mate. He will be sorely missed.\u201d\nMr. Elayyan was born in Kuwait and studied computer science at the University of Canterbury. He was the chief executive and a co-founder of LWA Solutions, a mobile app start-up. He was well known in the futsal world and in Christchurch\u2019s tech community.\nHe and his wife, Farah, have a young daughter, Aya, whose photos appear in abundance on his Facebook page. In one, she is wearing a bib that says: \u201cMy dad rocks.\u201d\n[We learned more about Mr. Elayyan from his family as they gathered to remember him and say goodbye.]\nMucad Ibrahim\nImage\nThree-year-old Mucad Ibrahim is the youngest person confirmed to have been killed in the attacks. He was at Al Noor mosque and became separated from his brother and father when the shooting began.\n\u201cHe was a Muslim-born Kiwi who was full of energy, love and happiness,\u201d his family said in a statement. \u201cHe is remembered in our community as a young boy who emanated nothing but the representation of God\u2019s love, peace and mercy.\u201d\n\u201cWill miss you dearly brother,\u201d Mucad\u2019s brother Abdi Ibrahim wrote on Facebook.\nMucad was wearing a white thobe and his favorite white hat on Friday, \u201cand so returned to His Lord in a state of pure innocence and spiritual beauty,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said.\nThe family said they had taken solace from a global outpouring of support. \u201cKnowing that New Zealand and the whole world stands behind our boy reassures us that violence and racism are unwelcome in our world,\u201d they said.\nSayyad Milne\nImage\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost my little boy, he\u2019s just turned 14,\u201d Sayyad Milne\u2019s father, John Milne, told The New Zealand Herald through tears.\nSayyad was one of two Cashmere High School students killed in the attack, according to the school\u2019s principal, Mark Wilson. The boy was an avid soccer player.\n\u201cHe proved himself to be not only a truly outstanding goalkeeper, but a great friend and colleague, a real team player with a fabulous attitude and a warm and friendly personality,\u201d St. Albans Shirley Football Club said in a statement on Facebook.\n\u201cSayyad was one of our own and we will always remember him.\u201d\nLilik Abdul Hamid\nImage\nLilik Abdul Hamid, 57, originally from Indonesia, had been an aircraft maintenance engineer with Air New Zealand for 16 years, the company\u2019s chief executive, Christopher Luxon, said in a statement.\n\u201cHe first got to know the team even earlier when he worked with our aircraft engineers in a previous role overseas,\u201d Mr. Luxon said. \u201cThe friendships he made at that time led him to apply for a role in Air New Zealand and make the move to Christchurch.\u201d\nMr. Hamid is survived by his wife and two children, Mr. Luxon said. On Facebook, one of Mr. Hamid\u2019s friends called him \u201ca man with a gold heart who always opened his heart and home to everyone.\u201d\nAreeb Ahmed\nImage\nAreeb Ahmed, 27, was an employee of PricewaterhouseCoopers, a statement released by the company said. Pakistan\u2019s foreign ministry said he was originally from that country\u2019s largest city, Karachi.\n\u201cAreeb was a loved and respected member of our PwC family,\u201d the company wrote on Facebook. \u201cHis smile, warmth, dedication, respect and humor will be deeply missed.\u201d\nTariq Omar\nImage\nNew Zealand Football confirmed the death of Tariq Omar, 24, a soccer player who coached for several of Christchurch United Football Club\u2019s junior teams. Colin Williamson, the club\u2019s academy director, called him \u201ca beautiful human being with a tremendous heart and love for coaching.\u201d\n\u201cOur coaches and his players are struggling to understand what has happened and we are trying to support our club members as best as we can,\u201d Mr. Williamson said in a statement released by the club. \u201cBut of course our main thoughts and concerns go out to Tariq\u2019s family who are in our hearts and prayers.\u201d\nShahid Suhail\nImage\nShahid Suhail, 35, from Pakistan, was an engineer who worked for a resin manufacturer in Christchurch, according to Stuff, a news website. He had a wife and two young daughters. \u201cHis daughters were his life,\u201d said his wife, Asma.\nSyed Jahandad Ali\nImage\nSyed Jahandad Ali, 34, originally from Lahore, Pakistan, worked at Intergen, a software company and had a wife and three children, according to a fundraising page created by the company. In a statement, the company called him \u201ca kind and gentle man.\u201d\n\u201cSyed Jahandad Ali has deeply touched the lives of his friends, colleagues and wider technology community through his knowledge and skills.

The younger Mr. Nabi\u2019s hands trembled as he held up his mobile phone to show a picture of his father with his daughter in the mosque on a different day.\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d make it to the prayers.

He arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday to speak with officials in Kuwait, Israel and Lebanon about containing Iran.</p>\n<p>Under plans recommended by Mr. Pompeo and some White House officials, the State Department would designate Iran&rsquo;s military <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/world/middleeast/iran-bombing.html\">Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps</a> as a foreign terrorist organization. It would be a first instance of the United States designating a unit of another government&rsquo;s military as a terrorist group. American officials said it could put United States troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions by foreign governments.</p>\n<p>The plans also would designate some Iraqi Shiite militias as foreign terrorist organizations. As a result, the Iranian-trained militias &mdash; and Iraqi officials who support them &mdash; would be subject to new economic sanctions and travel restrictions.</p>\n<p>The proposal was described to The New York Times on condition of anonymity by a half-dozen American and Iraqi officials and experts familiar with the sensitive diplomatic plans but not authorized to discuss them by name.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pompeo confirmed Monday night that he was looking at various groups, including the Revolutionary Guards in Iran, after he was asked by The Times on the flight to Kuwait about the proposed designations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There may well be other organizations that we designate,&rdquo; he said. The State Department designated an Iraqi group as a terrorist organization this month, despite opposition from the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>The Iraqi militias &mdash; some of which were trained by the Revolutionary Guards &mdash; operate with Baghdad&rsquo;s approval or financial support. Several are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/world/middleeast/iran-iraq-rouhani.html\">legitimate players in Iraqi politics</a>. They are part of the <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/more-than-militias-iraqs-popular-mobilization-forces-are-here-to-stay/\">Popular Mobilization Forces</a>, an umbrella organization of about 50 paramilitary groups that fought against the Islamic State, a radical Sunni group, and are paid by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Americans can make the decisions they want, but what the Americans see is different than what we see,&rdquo; Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said last week. &ldquo;Our position on the Popular Mobilization Forces is very clear and well known.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Officials at the Pentagon and the C.I.A. &mdash; which Mr. Pompeo ran in the Trump administration&rsquo;s first year &mdash; oppose designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards or the Iraqi militias as terrorist groups, fearing a backlash that could constrain American troops. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander\">Qassim Suleimani</a>, commander of the corps&rsquo; elite Quds Force and a regular visitor to Iraq, has been designated a terrorist by the United States.</p>\n<p>Iraqi leaders were already irate over the Trump administration&rsquo;s insistence that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/middleeast/us-iran-sanctions-oil-waivers.html\">they comply with American sanctions</a> imposed against Iran after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Tehran.</p>\n<p>Tensions between Washington and Baghdad have only risen through the winter.</p>\n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/world/middleeast/trump-iraq-iran-reaction.html\">Iraqi politicians bristled</a> after Mr. Trump said American troops in Iraq <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-syria-iran.html\">would monitor and pressure Iran</a>. Iraqi leaders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/iraq-buying-energy-iran.html\">are resisting demands by Mr. Pompeo</a> to stop buying energy from Iran &mdash; another issue on which Pentagon officials have sided with Baghdad. Iraq officials also remain unhappy by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-consulate-basra-closed.html\">closing of the United States Consulate in Basra</a>, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city, where a temporary halt of electricity exports from Iran led to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/middleeast/in-strategic-iraqi-city-a-week-of-deadly-turmoil.html\">violent rioting</a> last summer.</p>\n<p>On Friday, a senior State Department official said Mr. Pompeo&rsquo;s visit to the Middle East this week was part of the goal of rolling back Iran&rsquo;s forces and linked Shiite militias. As with Iraq, the pressure campaign has angered leaders in Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah is a major military force, holds parliamentary seats and runs the health ministry.</p>\n<p>Analysts said Mr. Pompeo&rsquo;s trip and its focus on Iran is an attempt <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/03/01/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-elections-225512\">to lend Trump administration support</a> to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before national elections set for April 9. Iran and Israel are longtime enemies. Mr. Pompeo has denied such intentions.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pompeo has told the leaders of power-starved Iraq that they must stop buying Iranian natural gas and electricity. But on Tuesday, following recommendations by senior Pentagon officials, he agreed to extend a waiver of the sanctions to allow Iraq to buy electricity from Iran. The new waiver will expire in 90 days, in the middle of Iraq&rsquo;s scorching summer.</p>\n<p>If they are forced to stop buying electricity from Iran, Iraqi officials warned, protests could destabilize the government of Mr. Abdul Mahdi, who was named prime minister in October. In February, he said Iraq would not comply with the sanctions, citing the 13 years of United Nations sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein that took a bruising toll on Iraqis throughout the country.</p>\n<p>Iraqi officials now are exploring how to buy natural gas from Iran but still protect Iraqi banks from American penalties.</p>\n<p>This month, against the advice of officials at the Pentagon, the State Department announced that <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2019/03/290002.htm\">it was designating</a> an Iraqi militia, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, and its leader, Akram Abbas al-Kaabi, as &ldquo;specially designated global terrorists.&rdquo; The group is funded by the Iraqi government, but the State Department said its loyalty was to Iran.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pompeo also is seeking to designate a more significant group, Asa&rsquo;ib Ahl al-Haq, as a terrorist organization. Asa&rsquo;ib Ahl al-Haq won <a href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/iranian-militias-in-iraqs-parliament-political-outcomes-and-u.s.-response\">15 seats in Iraq&rsquo;s Parliament</a> last year. Though its officials now say they tolerate the United States military presence in Iraq, the militia fought American troops at the height of the Iraq war. The militia is led by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-election-enemies.html\">Qais al-Khazali</a>, a former American detainee who is accused of masterminding an ambush in the holy Shiite city of Karbala that killed five American soldiers in 2007.</p>\n<p>After Mr. Trump announced in December that he would withdraw United States forces from the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, American officials began quietly negotiating with Iraqi counterparts to shift hundreds of commandos and support troops to Iraq. The initial urgency for the shift has cooled, however, now that Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/middleeast/trump-troops-syria-.html\">has agreed to leave 400 American troops</a> in Syria rather than withdraw all 2,000. But many Iraqi lawmakers are reluctant to give the 5,200 American troops already in Baghdad and at a handful of other bases much freedom to move or operate.</p>\n<p>The terrorist designations could complicate talks over those issues and a range of diplomatic matters by fueling animosity toward the United States. One senior American official said the designations could lead to barring members of the Iraqi and Iranian governments from traveling to the United States &mdash; including to the United Nations in New York.</p>\n<p>Administration lawyers have been poring over the proposed language for the terrorist designations and their possible consequences. So far, that has kept Mr. Pompeo from issuing them, two senior American officials said.

                "text": "Furqan Al-Aaraji/EPA, via Shutterstock\nKUWAIT CITY \u2014 The United States\u2019 attempts to isolate Iran, including by punishing Iraqi militias and politicians who are supported by Iranian officials, has deepened tensions not only between Washington and Baghdad but also within the Trump administration.\nAmerican military and intelligence officials said the increasing pressure on Iraq risks infuriating its Parliament, including politicians linked to Iran, which could limit the movements of the 5,200 United States troops based in Iraq.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, whose confrontational stand on Iran has already strained ties with European allies, is leading the push for Iraq to confront its fellow Shiite-majority neighbor. He arrived in the Middle East on Tuesday to speak with officials in Kuwait, Israel and Lebanon about containing Iran.\nUnder plans recommended by Mr. Pompeo and some White House officials, the State Department would designate Iran\u2019s military Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. It would be a first instance of the United States designating a unit of another government\u2019s military as a terrorist group. American officials said it could put United States troops and intelligence officers at risk of similar actions by foreign governments.\nThe plans also would designate some Iraqi Shiite militias as foreign terrorist organizations. As a result, the Iranian-trained militias \u2014 and Iraqi officials who support them \u2014 would be subject to new economic sanctions and travel restrictions.\nThe proposal was described to The New York Times on condition of anonymity by a half-dozen American and Iraqi officials and experts familiar with the sensitive diplomatic plans but not authorized to discuss them by name.\nMr. Pompeo confirmed Monday night that he was looking at various groups, including the Revolutionary Guards in Iran, after he was asked by The Times on the flight to Kuwait about the proposed designations.\n\u201cThere may well be other organizations that we designate,\u201d he said. The State Department designated an Iraqi group as a terrorist organization this month, despite opposition from the Pentagon.\nThe Iraqi militias \u2014 some of which were trained by the Revolutionary Guards \u2014 operate with Baghdad\u2019s approval or financial support. Several are legitimate players in Iraqi politics. They are part of the Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella organization of about 50 paramilitary groups that fought against the Islamic State, a radical Sunni group, and are paid by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government.\n\u201cThe Americans can make the decisions they want, but what the Americans see is different than what we see,\u201d Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq said last week. \u201cOur position on the Popular Mobilization Forces is very clear and well known.\u201d\nOfficials at the Pentagon and the C.I.A. \u2014 which Mr. Pompeo ran in the Trump administration\u2019s first year \u2014 oppose designating the Iranian Revolutionary Guards or the Iraqi militias as terrorist groups, fearing a backlash that could constrain American troops. Qassim Suleimani, commander of the corps\u2019 elite Quds Force and a regular visitor to Iraq, has been designated a terrorist by the United States.\nIraqi leaders were already irate over the Trump administration\u2019s insistence that they comply with American sanctions imposed against Iran after President Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Tehran.\nTensions between Washington and Baghdad have only risen through the winter.\nIn February, Iraqi politicians bristled after Mr. Trump said American troops in Iraq would monitor and pressure Iran. Iraqi leaders are resisting demands by Mr. Pompeo to stop buying energy from Iran \u2014 another issue on which Pentagon officials have sided with Baghdad. Iraq officials also remain unhappy by the closing of the United States Consulate in Basra, the country\u2019s second-largest city, where a temporary halt of electricity exports from Iran led to violent rioting last summer.\nOn Friday, a senior State Department official said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s visit to the Middle East this week was part of the goal of rolling back Iran\u2019s forces and linked Shiite militias. As with Iraq, the pressure campaign has angered leaders in Lebanon, where Iran-backed Hezbollah is a major military force, holds parliamentary seats and runs the health ministry.\nAnalysts said Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip and its focus on Iran is an attempt to lend Trump administration support to embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel before national elections set for April 9. Iran and Israel are longtime enemies. Mr. Pompeo has denied such intentions.\nMr. Pompeo has told the leaders of power-starved Iraq that they must stop buying Iranian natural gas and electricity. But on Tuesday, following recommendations by senior Pentagon officials, he agreed to extend a waiver of the sanctions to allow Iraq to buy electricity from Iran. The new waiver will expire in 90 days, in the middle of Iraq\u2019s scorching summer.\nIf they are forced to stop buying electricity from Iran, Iraqi officials warned, protests could destabilize the government of Mr. Abdul Mahdi, who was named prime minister in October. In February, he said Iraq would not comply with the sanctions, citing the 13 years of United Nations sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein that took a bruising toll on Iraqis throughout the country.\nIraqi officials now are exploring how to buy natural gas from Iran but still protect Iraqi banks from American penalties.\nThis month, against the advice of officials at the Pentagon, the State Department announced that it was designating an Iraqi militia, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, and its leader, Akram Abbas al-Kaabi, as \u201cspecially designated global terrorists.\u201d The group is funded by the Iraqi government, but the State Department said its loyalty was to Iran.\nMr. Pompeo also is seeking to designate a more significant group, Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, as a terrorist organization. Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq won 15 seats in Iraq\u2019s Parliament last year. Though its officials now say they tolerate the United States military presence in Iraq, the militia fought American troops at the height of the Iraq war. The militia is led by Qais al-Khazali, a former American detainee who is accused of masterminding an ambush in the holy Shiite city of Karbala that killed five American soldiers in 2007.\nAfter Mr. Trump announced in December that he would withdraw United States forces from the fight against the Islamic State in Syria, American officials began quietly negotiating with Iraqi counterparts to shift hundreds of commandos and support troops to Iraq. The initial urgency for the shift has cooled, however, now that Mr. Trump has agreed to leave 400 American troops in Syria rather than withdraw all 2,000. But many Iraqi lawmakers are reluctant to give the 5,200 American troops already in Baghdad and at a handful of other bases much freedom to move or operate.\nThe terrorist designations could complicate talks over those issues and a range of diplomatic matters by fueling animosity toward the United States. One senior American official said the designations could lead to barring members of the Iraqi and Iranian governments from traveling to the United States \u2014 including to the United Nations in New York.\nAdministration lawyers have been poring over the proposed language for the terrorist designations and their possible consequences. So far, that has kept Mr. Pompeo from issuing them, two senior American officials said. One official said that trying to enforce the sanctions that the terrorist designations would prompt would be a nightmare.",

Everyone welcomed her at her parents&rsquo; place after church on Sundays, at birthday parties for nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p>Then in October, that door snapped shut again: A preview for the documentary &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/arts/music/surviving-r-kelly.html\">Surviving R. Kelly</a>&rdquo; had dropped, and Sparkle was in it, telling the world what she thought Robert Kelly had done to her niece.</p>\n<p>One of her sisters texted her to say that she heard Sparkle was on &ldquo;some TV show about rob&rdquo; talking about the family. She told Sparkle to leave them alone.</p>\n<p>Sparkle, a singer, was once R. Kelly&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. He produced her first album in the late 1990s, which went gold. But in 2002, he was arrested on child pornography charges stemming from a video that shows a man having sex with and urinating on a teenager. Sparkle testified at trial in 2008 that the man in the video was Mr. Kelly, and that the girl was her 14-year-old niece.</p>\n<p>Her testimony sliced her family into factions, relegating her to years of exile, and it may have stifled her career. Today, Sparkle is arguably more well known for her public stand against him than she is for her music. And as Mr. Kelly faces new charges of sexual abuse, prosecutors have told her she may be called to testify again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope they don&rsquo;t need me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I have to.

(She described her current age as &ldquo;somewhere between birth and death.&rdquo;) The family moved to the suburb of Oak Park when Sparkle was 3, and she started singing in church a year later. Encouraged by her father, she and her siblings formed a gospel group growing up. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if I ever dreamed of being a professional singer, because I wanted to be a model,&rdquo; she said with a laugh. &ldquo;But dear old dad, he was like, &lsquo;No, you get up there and you sing, and you&rsquo;d better be the loudest!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She met Mr. Kelly in 1989 and a few years later, she said, she was singing backup on an album he was producing: &ldquo;Age Ain&rsquo;t Nothing but a Number,&rdquo; by the singer <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/02/arts/a-pioneer-briefly-of-a-new-sound.html\">Aaliyah</a>. The album title would soon take on a sinister cast: The year the record was released, a 27-year-old Mr. Kelly reportedly married Aaliyah, who was 15. The marriage was annulled. (Aaliyah <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/27/arts/aaliyah-22-singer-who-first-hit-the-charts-at-14.html\">died in a plane crash</a> in 2001.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s lawyer declined to comment for this article.</p>\n<p>Sparkle said that at the time, she thought talk of the marriage was a publicity stunt. How could anything like that happen when Aaliyah&rsquo;s parents and her uncle, who was Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s manager, were always around? Still, she continued working with him.</p>\n<p>Then, in 1996, Mr. Kelly changed Sparkle&rsquo;s life. She was at a big retirement party for her father when Mr. Kelly called and asked her to come down to his studio in the River West neighborhood of Chicago. Down she went in a long black gown and heels, and when she arrived, she started recording what would become her own debut album, &ldquo;Sparkle.&rdquo; She spent time recording at night and went to work during the day at SportsChannel Chicago as an assistant engineer.</p>\n<p>Sparkle&rsquo;s album, released in 1998, was a success, selling half a million copies. But even before its release, her professional relationship with Mr. Kelly was so strained that he had threatened not to release it at all, she said. By the time they started working on her second album, it was untenable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He was trying to now be really controlling, and I saw it now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to do that with me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sparkle said that she asked to be released from her contract, and he let her go. She put out her second album, &ldquo;Told You So,&rdquo; with Motown records in 2000, but it was far less successful.</p>\n<p>Sparkle is still a singer, though she has never repeated the success she saw 20 years ago. She sang backup for Toni Braxton for a few years. She released a single in 2012 called &ldquo;So Bad.&rdquo; She said that private performances have helped her make a living. And just before the documentary about Mr. Kelly came out in January, she released a new song called &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1gMpP9A0Pk\">We Are Ready</a>,&rdquo; which explores the themes of the #MeToo movement. It is impossible to know what effect her schism with Mr. Kelly had on her career, but in a business grounded in relationships, alienating such a powerful figure certainly could have created roadblocks.</p>\n<p>Today, she lives in downtown Chicago with Bruce Wayne, her manager and boyfriend of nearly 20 years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fighting to have a street named after her,&rdquo; Mr. Wayne said. &ldquo;She held a mirror up to society. This is bigger than R. Kelly, and she&rsquo;s been so far ahead of everybody.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With long blond hair and an elegant bearing, Sparkle carries herself like a woman who knows how to have her picture taken, and how to stand her ground. But there is a warmth behind the glamorous presentation.</p>\n<p>Good friends call her Steph, but Mr. Wayne has a lot of people calling her Miss Jenkins. That nickname comes from a skit on the TV show &ldquo;In Living Color,&rdquo; in which a gossipy character named Benita Butrell would dish into the camera and then proclaim, &ldquo;but I ain&rsquo;t one to gossip, so you ain&rsquo;t hear that from me.&rdquo; The character was known for freaking out and saying &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t nobody better say nothing bad about Miss Jenkins!&rdquo; before trashing Miss Jenkins.</p>\n<p>Sparkle, he said, hates keeping secrets, even of the most uncomfortable truths. She believes that if someone has done wrong, she is obligated to tell.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Growing up, she was the one who always blew the whistle and told,&rdquo; Mr. Wayne said. &ldquo;This is, I guess, her call of duty.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before she and Mr. Kelly went their separate ways, Sparkle made a decision that would fundamentally alter her family: She introduced Mr. Kelly to her brother-in-law, a guitar player, and to her niece. The girl was an aspiring rapper, charismatic and talented, and Sparkle said she hoped Mr. Kelly could do for her niece what he was doing for her. (Her niece is now in her mid-30s, but Sparkle still refuses to say her name during interviews, which she describes as an effort to protect her.)</p>\n<p>In 2001, a lawyer who said he wanted to represent her sister contacted Sparkle to say he had a tape of her niece having sex with Mr. Kelly. Sparkle decided to testify against Mr. Kelly, along with about a dozen other witnesses who identified Mr. Kelly and her niece in court. But her sister insisted that the girl in the video was not her child. The family split. Only one of Sparkle&rsquo;s brothers &mdash; Bennie Edwards, who used to braid her hair and make her breakfast every morning as a child &mdash; stood by her.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sparkle, she loves her family, they need to know that,&rdquo; Mr. Edwards said. &ldquo;I love them as well, but the truth &mdash; the truth is the truth at the end of the day, and that&rsquo;s all it is.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Kelly was acquitted on all charges in 2008. Sparkle&rsquo;s niece never testified, and his lawyers argued successfully that the identities of the people in the video could not be known for certain.</p>\n<p>Now, prosecutors in Chicago say that another tape has surfaced showing Mr. Kelly having sex with the same girl. Mr. Kelly was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/r-kelly-charged-indicted.html\">arrested</a> in February on charges involving four alleged victims, and while any trial could still be years away, the tape is a crucial piece of evidence in what may be the strongest case against him. Sparkle said she has seen stills of the video and that it&rsquo;s clearly a different recording of the same people. Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer who gave the tape to prosecutors, said the people on the tape talk about the girl&rsquo;s 14-year-old body parts.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Avenatti is now facing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/us/avenatti-indictment.html\">legal troubles</a> of his own, with federal prosecutors accusing him of stealing money from clients and lying about his income to the I.R.S. and in bankruptcy court. Mr. Avenatti has denied all the allegations against him and suggested that the case was politically motivated. (He has represented Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Trump.) &ldquo;Any charges I am facing have nothing to do with the R. Kelly case and will have zero impact,&rdquo; Mr. Avenatti said. &ldquo;Greenberg is desperate,&rdquo; he added, referring to Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s lawyer, Steven Greenberg.</p>\n<p>Mr. Greenberg has asked the judge for all electronic communications between Mr. Avenatti and the prosecutors. Mr. Greenberg suggested in a filing that the Cook County State&rsquo;s Attorney Kimberly M. Foxx may have been &ldquo;manipulated&rdquo; by Mr. Avenatti.</p>\n<p>Friction between members of the Edwards family began to fade once Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s trial was over, and in 2011, while planning their parents&rsquo; 50th wedding anniversary, the siblings started speaking again. But inside their new calm, nothing related to Mr. Kelly was discussed, even as her brother-in-law continued to play guitar with him professionally. When Sparkle tried to speak with her sister about what happened, her sister would only say, &ldquo;God forgives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In recent years, as Sparkle watched the #MeToo movement shake the country, she did not expect it to come for Mr. Kelly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was for us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for black people.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Then the filmmaker Dream Hampton reached out to Sparkle to ask if she would <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/media/r-kelly-jim-derogatis-dream-hampton.html\">participate in a documentary</a> about Mr. Kelly that would chronicle his alleged history of abusing girls and women. Sparkle said she agreed to participate when it was made clear to her that her story would be in the documentary, whether she was or not. She said she didn&rsquo;t want someone else to get it wrong.</p>\n<p>So she recorded an interview for what became &ldquo;Surviving R. Kelly.&rdquo; The documentary unleashed a torrent of criticism against Mr. Kelly when it was released in January, increasing public pressure on law enforcement to pursue him. He was quickly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/arts/music/r-kelly-rca-sony.html\">dropped</a> by his record label.</p>\n<p>But Sparkle did not tell the family the documentary was coming. Her mother had dementia and her health was failing.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want this to be my mom&rsquo;s end,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>In the fall, just days after her mother died, the trailer for &ldquo;Surviving R. Kelly&rdquo; was released, and Sparkle was in it. Her sister texted her and told her to leave them alone. Bennie Edwards and their brother, Lee, are the only two of her five siblings who are speaking with her now.</p>\n<p>She has been criticized for trying to capitalize on the film with her new single, &ldquo;We Are Ready,&rdquo; she said, but she is a singer, and this is how she processes her life. She plans to release an EP, &ldquo;Obstacle Course,&rdquo; her first in nearly 20 years, this summer.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know, I was thinking back to a time, before was a MeToo,&rdquo; she says on her new single, &ldquo;it was just me.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times\nCHICAGO \u2014 After nearly a decade of silence, the musician Sparkle and her family were finally talking again. Everyone welcomed her at her parents\u2019 place after church on Sundays, at birthday parties for nieces and nephews.\nThen in October, that door snapped shut again: A preview for the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d had dropped, and Sparkle was in it, telling the world what she thought Robert Kelly had done to her niece.\nOne of her sisters texted her to say that she heard Sparkle was on \u201csome TV show about rob\u201d talking about the family. She told Sparkle to leave them alone.\nSparkle, a singer, was once R. Kelly\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. He produced her first album in the late 1990s, which went gold. But in 2002, he was arrested on child pornography charges stemming from a video that shows a man having sex with and urinating on a teenager. Sparkle testified at trial in 2008 that the man in the video was Mr. Kelly, and that the girl was her 14-year-old niece.\nHer testimony sliced her family into factions, relegating her to years of exile, and it may have stifled her career. Today, Sparkle is arguably more well known for her public stand against him than she is for her music. And as Mr. Kelly faces new charges of sexual abuse, prosecutors have told her she may be called to testify again.\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t need me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have to. I have to see this thing through.\u201d\n[Read more about the latest charges against R. Kelly.]\nSparkle, whose real name is Stephanie Edwards, was born on the West Side of Chicago, the youngest of six children. (She described her current age as \u201csomewhere between birth and death.\u201d) The family moved to the suburb of Oak Park when Sparkle was 3, and she started singing in church a year later. Encouraged by her father, she and her siblings formed a gospel group growing up. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever dreamed of being a professional singer, because I wanted to be a model,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut dear old dad, he was like, \u2018No, you get up there and you sing, and you\u2019d better be the loudest!\u2019\u201d\nShe met Mr. Kelly in 1989 and a few years later, she said, she was singing backup on an album he was producing: \u201cAge Ain\u2019t Nothing but a Number,\u201d by the singer Aaliyah. The album title would soon take on a sinister cast: The year the record was released, a 27-year-old Mr. Kelly reportedly married Aaliyah, who was 15. The marriage was annulled. (Aaliyah died in a plane crash in 2001.)\nMr. Kelly\u2019s lawyer declined to comment for this article.\nSparkle said that at the time, she thought talk of the marriage was a publicity stunt. How could anything like that happen when Aaliyah\u2019s parents and her uncle, who was Mr. Kelly\u2019s manager, were always around? Still, she continued working with him.\nThen, in 1996, Mr. Kelly changed Sparkle\u2019s life. She was at a big retirement party for her father when Mr. Kelly called and asked her to come down to his studio in the River West neighborhood of Chicago. Down she went in a long black gown and heels, and when she arrived, she started recording what would become her own debut album, \u201cSparkle.\u201d She spent time recording at night and went to work during the day at SportsChannel Chicago as an assistant engineer.\nSparkle\u2019s album, released in 1998, was a success, selling half a million copies. But even before its release, her professional relationship with Mr. Kelly was so strained that he had threatened not to release it at all, she said. By the time they started working on her second album, it was untenable.\n\u201cHe was trying to now be really controlling, and I saw it now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that with me.\u201d\nSparkle said that she asked to be released from her contract, and he let her go. She put out her second album, \u201cTold You So,\u201d with Motown records in 2000, but it was far less successful.\nSparkle is still a singer, though she has never repeated the success she saw 20 years ago. She sang backup for Toni Braxton for a few years. She released a single in 2012 called \u201cSo Bad.\u201d She said that private performances have helped her make a living. And just before the documentary about Mr. Kelly came out in January, she released a new song called \u201cWe Are Ready,\u201d which explores the themes of the #MeToo movement. It is impossible to know what effect her schism with Mr. Kelly had on her career, but in a business grounded in relationships, alienating such a powerful figure certainly could have created roadblocks.\nToday, she lives in downtown Chicago with Bruce Wayne, her manager and boyfriend of nearly 20 years.\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting to have a street named after her,\u201d Mr. Wayne said. \u201cShe held a mirror up to society. This is bigger than R. Kelly, and she\u2019s been so far ahead of everybody.\u201d\nWith long blond hair and an elegant bearing, Sparkle carries herself like a woman who knows how to have her picture taken, and how to stand her ground. But there is a warmth behind the glamorous presentation.\nGood friends call her Steph, but Mr. Wayne has a lot of people calling her Miss Jenkins. That nickname comes from a skit on the TV show \u201cIn Living Color,\u201d in which a gossipy character named Benita Butrell would dish into the camera and then proclaim, \u201cbut I ain\u2019t one to gossip, so you ain\u2019t hear that from me.\u201d The character was known for freaking out and saying \u201cDon\u2019t nobody better say nothing bad about Miss Jenkins!\u201d before trashing Miss Jenkins.\nSparkle, he said, hates keeping secrets, even of the most uncomfortable truths. She believes that if someone has done wrong, she is obligated to tell.\n\u201cGrowing up, she was the one who always blew the whistle and told,\u201d Mr. Wayne said. \u201cThis is, I guess, her call of duty.\u201d\nBefore she and Mr. Kelly went their separate ways, Sparkle made a decision that would fundamentally alter her family: She introduced Mr. Kelly to her brother-in-law, a guitar player, and to her niece. The girl was an aspiring rapper, charismatic and talented, and Sparkle said she hoped Mr. Kelly could do for her niece what he was doing for her. (Her niece is now in her mid-30s, but Sparkle still refuses to say her name during interviews, which she describes as an effort to protect her.)\nIn 2001, a lawyer who said he wanted to represent her sister contacted Sparkle to say he had a tape of her niece having sex with Mr. Kelly. Sparkle decided to testify against Mr. Kelly, along with about a dozen other witnesses who identified Mr. Kelly and her niece in court. But her sister insisted that the girl in the video was not her child. The family split. Only one of Sparkle\u2019s brothers \u2014 Bennie Edwards, who used to braid her hair and make her breakfast every morning as a child \u2014 stood by her.\n\u201cSparkle, she loves her family, they need to know that,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cI love them as well, but the truth \u2014 the truth is the truth at the end of the day, and that\u2019s all it is.\u201d\nMr. Kelly was acquitted on all charges in 2008. Sparkle\u2019s niece never testified, and his lawyers argued successfully that the identities of the people in the video could not be known for certain.\nNow, prosecutors in Chicago say that another tape has surfaced showing Mr. Kelly having sex with the same girl. Mr. Kelly was arrested in February on charges involving four alleged victims, and while any trial could still be years away, the tape is a crucial piece of evidence in what may be the strongest case against him. Sparkle said she has seen stills of the video and that it\u2019s clearly a different recording of the same people. Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer who gave the tape to prosecutors, said the people on the tape talk about the girl\u2019s 14-year-old body parts.\nBut Mr. Avenatti is now facing legal troubles of his own, with federal prosecutors accusing him of stealing money from clients and lying about his income to the I.R.S. and in bankruptcy court. Mr. Avenatti has denied all the allegations against him and suggested that the case was politically motivated. (He has represented Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against President Trump.) \u201cAny charges I am facing have nothing to do with the R. Kelly case and will have zero impact,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said. \u201cGreenberg is desperate,\u201d he added, referring to Mr. Kelly\u2019s lawyer, Steven Greenberg.\nMr. Greenberg has asked the judge for all electronic communications between Mr. Avenatti and the prosecutors. Mr. Greenberg suggested in a filing that the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kimberly M. Foxx may have been \u201cmanipulated\u201d by Mr. Avenatti.\nFriction between members of the Edwards family began to fade once Mr. Kelly\u2019s trial was over, and in 2011, while planning their parents\u2019 50th wedding anniversary, the siblings started speaking again. But inside their new calm, nothing related to Mr. Kelly was discussed, even as her brother-in-law continued to play guitar with him professionally. When Sparkle tried to speak with her sister about what happened, her sister would only say, \u201cGod forgives.\u201d\nIn recent years, as Sparkle watched the #MeToo movement shake the country, she did not expect it to come for Mr. Kelly.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was for us,\u201d she said, \u201cfor black people.\u201d\nThen the filmmaker Dream Hampton reached out to Sparkle to ask if she would participate in a documentary about Mr. Kelly that would chronicle his alleged history of abusing girls and women. Sparkle said she agreed to participate when it was made clear to her that her story would be in the documentary, whether she was or not. She said she didn\u2019t want someone else to get it wrong.\nSo she recorded an interview for what became \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d The documentary unleashed a torrent of criticism against Mr. Kelly when it was released in January, increasing public pressure on law enforcement to pursue him. He was quickly dropped by his record label.\nBut Sparkle did not tell the family the documentary was coming. Her mother had dementia and her health was failing.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want this to be my mom\u2019s end,\u201d she said.\nIn the fall, just days after her mother died, the trailer for \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d was released, and Sparkle was in it. Her sister texted her and told her to leave them alone. Bennie Edwards and their brother, Lee, are the only two of her five siblings who are speaking with her now.\nShe has been criticized for trying to capitalize on the film with her new single, \u201cWe Are Ready,\u201d she said, but she is a singer, and this is how she processes her life. She plans to release an EP, \u201cObstacle Course,\u201d her first in nearly 20 years, this summer.\n\u201cYou know, I was thinking back to a time, before was a MeToo,\u201d she says on her new single, \u201cit was just me.\u201d",

Seven medical device manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson &amp; Johnson, are paying nearly $8 billion to resolve the claims of more than 100,000 women.</p>\n<p>For years, women and legal advocates have tried to persuade the F.D.A. that the pelvic mesh implant causes harm. As the number of serious complications increased significantly, the F.D.A. reclassified this type of pelvic mesh as high risk in 2016 and told manufacturers to submit more evidence that the devices were safe and would benefit patients with the condition.</p>\n<p>In announcing its decision on Tuesday, the F.D.A. said that Boston Scientific and Coloplast, a Danish company, had not demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the devices.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In order for these mesh devices to stay on the market, we determined that we needed evidence that they worked better than surgery without the use of mesh to repair pelvic organ prolapse,&rdquo; said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the F.D.A.&rsquo;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long term.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Deborah Kotz, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the two medical device companies had 10 days to submit a plan for how the mesh devices will be withdrawn from the market.</p>\n<p>Shanin Specter, a lawyer who has won numerous big jury verdicts against firms that manufactured the pelvic mesh, said the F.D.A. should extend the decision to include mesh devices used for treatment of some urinary conditions.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a good step forward,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But mesh used to treat stress incontinence also continues to devastate thousands of women, and the F.D.A. should act decisively there, too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Boston Scientific, which had filed two applications for its devices, criticized the agency&rsquo;s action. &ldquo;We are deeply disappointed by the F.D.A.&rsquo;s decision on our premarket approval applications&rdquo; for two products, said Kate Haranis, a spokeswoman for the company. The company, she added, believes that &ldquo;the inaccessibility of these products will severely limit treatment options for the 50 percent of women in the U.S. who will suffer from pelvic organ prolapse during their lives.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Haranis said its transvaginal mesh product portfolio accounts for roughly $25 million in sales annually, or about 1 percent of the company&rsquo;s total sales. Its stock fell a little more than 4 percent on the news.</p>\n<p>Lina Danstrup, a spokeswoman for Coloplast, said in an email that Restorelle DirectFix Anterior, the affected device, represents about 0.2 percent of group revenues. Coloplast&rsquo;s stock also fell slightly on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Gynecologists have been implanting surgical mesh to repair pelvic organ prolapse since the 1970s, and they began using it for transvaginal repair of the condition in the 1990s. The mesh is implanted in the vaginal wall; complications have included bleeding, pain, inflammation and dislodging or protrusion through the wall that can cause infection. Many women have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/14/business/vaginal-mesh-surgery-lawsuits-financing.html\">required a second surgery to repair the damage</a>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Specter said the mesh device used in pelvic organ prolapse surgery tends to be larger and more injury-producing than the devices used in surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence.</p>\n<p>But even the small mesh devices have an unacceptably high complication rate, he said, in the range of 5 to 15 percent. &ldquo;There was never a need for these mesh products,&rdquo; he said, noting there is an alternative surgical procedure using a patient&rsquo;s own tissue.</p>\n<p>The disputes over the safety of pelvic mesh have gone on for more than a decade. Until Tuesday, the F.D.A. had never formally demanded that the products be taken off the market, but it had issued several warnings about the devices. The agency said earlier that it had received reports of more than 10,000 complaints of serious injury and nearly 80 deaths as of last year.</p>\n<p>Women who have already had the devices implanted and are not having problems with them should not take any action, other than to continue regular doctor visits, Ms. Kotz, the F.D.A. spokeswoman, said.</p>\n<p>It has been estimated that nearly 10 million women worldwide have received mesh implants to treat weakening pelvic muscles and alleviate urinary incontinence. Roughly 10 to 15 percent have suffered complications, in some cases requiring the mesh to be removed.</p>\n<p>In light of the litigation, warnings and complaints from women about severe pain and bleeding from mesh implants, some manufacturers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, had voluntarily stopped selling them.</p>\n<p>More than 100,000 people filed claims against the major manufacturers in federal and state courts. Although some of the settlement figures have been large, women have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/pelvic-mesh-settlements-lawyers.html\">complained that lawyers have taken a lot of the settlement money</a>. Documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews indicated that the average settlement for each woman was less than $60,000.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If this had happened at the very outset of the litigation, we might have seen higher settlement values,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in pelvic mesh litigation. &ldquo;It could help with the remaining cases. The plaintiffs themselves see this as a pretty huge victory and a victory that they wish had come a lot sooner.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In recent years, sales of the pelvic mesh had declined as companies stopped selling the devices and the costs of litigation mounted. From 2010 to 2017, sales in the United States amounted to about $600 million, according to some estimates.</p>",

                "text": "Boston Scientific\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday ordered the two remaining medical device companies selling surgical mesh for the repair of pelvic organ prolapse to stop all sales and distribution in the United States.\nIt is the most stringent action the F.D.A. has taken in the lengthy legal and medical battles over vaginal mesh, a synthetic product that has been implanted in millions of women to strengthen weakened pelvic muscles that can cause the bladder, the uterus and other organs to sag into the vaginal area.\nThe agency issued the decision against the two companies, Boston Scientific and Coloplast, at a time when multimillion-dollar verdicts against manufacturers of the devices continue to be awarded or upheld on appeal.\nLitigation over pelvic mesh, also called transvaginal mesh, ranks as one of the largest mass tort cases in the nation\u2019s history in terms of claims filed, number of corporate defendants and settlement dollars. Seven medical device manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, are paying nearly $8 billion to resolve the claims of more than 100,000 women.\nFor years, women and legal advocates have tried to persuade the F.D.A. that the pelvic mesh implant causes harm. As the number of serious complications increased significantly, the F.D.A. reclassified this type of pelvic mesh as high risk in 2016 and told manufacturers to submit more evidence that the devices were safe and would benefit patients with the condition.\nIn announcing its decision on Tuesday, the F.D.A. said that Boston Scientific and Coloplast, a Danish company, had not demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the devices.\n\u201cIn order for these mesh devices to stay on the market, we determined that we needed evidence that they worked better than surgery without the use of mesh to repair pelvic organ prolapse,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the F.D.A.\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t assure women that these devices were safe and effective long term.\u201d\nDeborah Kotz, a spokeswoman for the agency, said the two medical device companies had 10 days to submit a plan for how the mesh devices will be withdrawn from the market.\nShanin Specter, a lawyer who has won numerous big jury verdicts against firms that manufactured the pelvic mesh, said the F.D.A. should extend the decision to include mesh devices used for treatment of some urinary conditions.\n\u201cThis is a good step forward,\u201d he said. \u201cBut mesh used to treat stress incontinence also continues to devastate thousands of women, and the F.D.A. should act decisively there, too.\u201d\nBoston Scientific, which had filed two applications for its devices, criticized the agency\u2019s action. \u201cWe are deeply disappointed by the F.D.A.\u2019s decision on our premarket approval applications\u201d for two products, said Kate Haranis, a spokeswoman for the company. The company, she added, believes that \u201cthe inaccessibility of these products will severely limit treatment options for the 50 percent of women in the U.S. who will suffer from pelvic organ prolapse during their lives.\u201d\nMs. Haranis said its transvaginal mesh product portfolio accounts for roughly $25 million in sales annually, or about 1 percent of the company\u2019s total sales. Its stock fell a little more than 4 percent on the news.\nLina Danstrup, a spokeswoman for Coloplast, said in an email that Restorelle DirectFix Anterior, the affected device, represents about 0.2 percent of group revenues. Coloplast\u2019s stock also fell slightly on Tuesday.\nGynecologists have been implanting surgical mesh to repair pelvic organ prolapse since the 1970s, and they began using it for transvaginal repair of the condition in the 1990s. The mesh is implanted in the vaginal wall; complications have included bleeding, pain, inflammation and dislodging or protrusion through the wall that can cause infection. Many women have required a second surgery to repair the damage.\nMr. Specter said the mesh device used in pelvic organ prolapse surgery tends to be larger and more injury-producing than the devices used in surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence.\nBut even the small mesh devices have an unacceptably high complication rate, he said, in the range of 5 to 15 percent. \u201cThere was never a need for these mesh products,\u201d he said, noting there is an alternative surgical procedure using a patient\u2019s own tissue.\nThe disputes over the safety of pelvic mesh have gone on for more than a decade. Until Tuesday, the F.D.A. had never formally demanded that the products be taken off the market, but it had issued several warnings about the devices. The agency said earlier that it had received reports of more than 10,000 complaints of serious injury and nearly 80 deaths as of last year.\nWomen who have already had the devices implanted and are not having problems with them should not take any action, other than to continue regular doctor visits, Ms. Kotz, the F.D.A. spokeswoman, said.\nIt has been estimated that nearly 10 million women worldwide have received mesh implants to treat weakening pelvic muscles and alleviate urinary incontinence. Roughly 10 to 15 percent have suffered complications, in some cases requiring the mesh to be removed.\nIn light of the litigation, warnings and complaints from women about severe pain and bleeding from mesh implants, some manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson, had voluntarily stopped selling them.\nMore than 100,000 people filed claims against the major manufacturers in federal and state courts. Although some of the settlement figures have been large, women have complained that lawyers have taken a lot of the settlement money. Documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews indicated that the average settlement for each woman was less than $60,000.\n\u201cIf this had happened at the very outset of the litigation, we might have seen higher settlement values,\u201d said Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia and an expert in pelvic mesh litigation. \u201cIt could help with the remaining cases. The plaintiffs themselves see this as a pretty huge victory and a victory that they wish had come a lot sooner.\u201d\nIn recent years, sales of the pelvic mesh had declined as companies stopped selling the devices and the costs of litigation mounted. From 2010 to 2017, sales in the United States amounted to about $600 million, according to some estimates.",

The building &mdash; an aging Brutalist layer cake, selected by the bureau&rsquo;s founders for the aspirational symbolism of its proximity to the White House, one block away &mdash; was under renovation, and so each visitor in turn trudged around to a side entrance. Inside the building, Mulvaney had begun another kind of reconstruction, one that would shift the balance of power between the politically influential industries that lend money and the hundreds of millions of Americans who borrow it.</p>\n<p>Three months earlier, President Trump installed Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, as the C.F.P.B.&rsquo;s acting director. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, envisioned it as a kind of economic equalizer for American consumers, a counter to the country&rsquo;s rising structural inequality. Republicans had come to view her creation as a &ldquo;rogue agency&rdquo; with &ldquo;dictatorial powers unique in the American republic,&rdquo; as <a href=\"https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL[1]-ben_1468872234.pdf\">the party&rsquo;s 2016 platform put it</a>. In Congress, Mulvaney had established himself as an outspoken enemy of the bureau, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaVeNafdyVA\">describing it</a>, memorably, as a &ldquo;joke&rdquo; in &ldquo;a sick, sad kind of way&rdquo; and sponsoring legislation to abolish it.</p>\n<p>Some of those invited to the meeting in February had picketed outside the bureau&rsquo;s headquarters on Mulvaney&rsquo;s first day at work. Their unease had only grown as Mulvaney ordered a hiring freeze, put new enforcement cases on hold and sent the Federal Reserve, which funds the C.F.P.B., a budget request for zero dollars, saying the bureau could <a href=\"https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_fy2018_q2_funding-request-letter-to-frb.pdf\">make do with the money it had on hand</a>. Within weeks, Mulvaney announced that he would reconsider one of the bureau&rsquo;s major long-term initiatives: rules to restrict payday loans, products that are marketed to the working poor as an emergency lifeline but frequently leave them buried in debt. &ldquo;Anybody who thinks that a Trump-administration C.F.P.B. would be the same as an Obama-administration C.F.P.B. is simply being na&iuml;ve,&rdquo; Mulvaney told reporters. &ldquo;Elections have consequences at every agency.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mulvaney was also aware that appearances have consequences. For agency heads, it is important to appear open to all points of view about their regulatory decisions, especially if they end up having to defend them in court. In February, he agreed to meet with his critics in person. Thirty or so people gathered around a conference table as rain lashed the windows. Mulvaney, who is 51, has close-cropped hair and a bulldog countenance that befits his manner. A founder of the House&rsquo;s hard-line Freedom Caucus, he can be sarcastic, even withering, in hearings and speeches. But Mulvaney struck a placating tone with his guests. He kept his opening remarks brief, according to six people who attended the meeting. Important things at the bureau would not change, he reassured them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to burn the place down,&rdquo; he insisted. Mulvaney said he did not intend to discuss his plans for the payday-loan rule with them but encouraged everyone to share their views.</p>\n<p>Many of Mulvaney&rsquo;s guests came from advocacy groups, like Americans for Financial Reform and the Center for Responsible Lending, that often did battle with Washington&rsquo;s powerful financial-industry lobby. But the meeting also included a dozen religious leaders, among them officials from national evangelical and Baptist organizations, whose members tend to be among Trump&rsquo;s most loyal supporters. These leaders viewed payday lending as not only unfair but also sinful, and they had fought against it across Trump country &mdash; in deep-red South Dakota, on the same day Trump won the presidency, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure effectively banning payday loans. The ministers had planned carefully for their moment with Mulvaney, and for 20 minutes they took turns detailing the harm that payday lending had inflicted on their neighborhoods and congregations. Eventually they gave the floor to the Rev. Amiri B. Hooker, who led an African-American church near Mulvaney&rsquo;s old congressional district.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I told him I was from Kershaw County,&rdquo; Hooker told me recently, recalling his exchange with Mulvaney. &ldquo;He smiled and asked how were the good folks from Kershaw.&rdquo; When Hooker pastored in Lake City, an hour away from Kershaw, a quarter of his congregation either had taken out payday loans themselves or knew someone who had. He told Mulvaney about an 84-year-old congregant in Lake City whom, during a week that she was so sick that she missed services, he saw hobbling toward him down the street. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;I had to go pay my bill,&rsquo; &rdquo; Hooker recalled. The woman had taken out a $250 loan almost three years earlier to cover her granddaughter&rsquo;s heating bill. She was still paying it off, Hooker told Mulvaney, at a cost of $75 a month, rolling over the loan into a new one each time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/magazine/cities-fine-poor-jail.html\"><em>[How cities make money by fining the poor.]</em></a></p>\n<p>Despite his earlier reticence, Mulvaney seemed eager to offer his own view of how the bureau ought to operate. It wasn&rsquo;t up to the federal government to stop people from taking the kind of credit that suited them, he suggested: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason people should be taking these loans &mdash; but they do.&rdquo; He pointed out that there wasn&rsquo;t anyone in the room from North Carolina, where payday lending was illegal. They should plead their case to state officials. &ldquo;You have a place to go to address payday loans, and it&rsquo;s not me,&rdquo; he said, according to multiple attendees. As the C.F.P.B.&rsquo;s acting director, he wouldn&rsquo;t stop enforcing the law as written. He only wanted a more efficient bureau, he explained, one steeped in evidence-based decision-making, one that educated consumers to make good decisions on their own. Mulvaney provided few details about how it would all look, but he promised the pastors he would follow up to let them know which way he decided to go on payday-loan regulation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard from him,&rdquo; Hooker says.</p>\n<p>In the months that followed, Mulvaney&rsquo;s vision for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would become clearer. This account of Mulvaney&rsquo;s tenure is based on interviews with more than 60 current or former bureau employees, current and former Mulvaney aides, consumer advocates and financial-industry executives and lobbyists, as well as hundreds of pages of internal bureau documents obtained by The New York Times and others. When Mulvaney took over, the fledgling C.F.P.B. was perhaps Washington&rsquo;s most feared financial regulator: It announced dozens of cases annually against abusive debt collectors, sloppy credit agencies and predatory lenders, and it was poised to force sweeping changes on the $30 billion payday-loan industry, one of the few corners of the financial world that operates free of federal regulation. What he left behind is an agency whose very mission is now a matter of bitter dispute. &ldquo;The bureau was constructed really deliberately to protect ordinary people,&rdquo; says Lisa Donner, the head of Americans for Financial Reform. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken it apart &mdash; dismantled it, piece by piece, brick by brick.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mulvaney&rsquo;s careful campaign of deconstruction offers a case study in the Trump administration&rsquo;s approach to transforming Washington, one in which strategic neglect and bureaucratic self-sabotage create versions of agencies that seem to run contrary to their basic premises. According to one person who speaks with Mulvaney often, his smooth subdual of the C.F.P.B. was part of his pitch to Trump for his promotion to White House chief of staff &mdash; long one of the most powerful jobs in Washington. Mulvaney&rsquo;s slow-rolling attack on the bureau&rsquo;s enforcement and regulatory powers wasn&rsquo;t just one of the Trump era&rsquo;s most emblematic assaults on the so-called administrative state. It was also, in part, an audition.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Elizabeth Warren testifying on Capitol Hill in 2011.\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/magazine/21mag-CFPB-Pic3/21mag-CFPB-Pic3-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcSet=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/magazine/21mag-CFPB-Pic3/21mag-CFPB-Pic3-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/magazine/21mag-CFPB-Pic3/21mag-CFPB-Pic3-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/magazine/21mag-CFPB-Pic3/21mag-CFPB-Pic3-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 2048w\"></img><figcaption>Elizabeth Warren testifying on Capitol Hill in 2011.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>The Consumer Financial</strong> Protection Bureau emerged from a liberal concern that the American political economy was increasingly defined by <a href=\"https://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/#income-inequality\">inequality</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/business/dealbook/household-debt-united-states.html\">consumer debt</a>. As a young academic in the 1980s, Warren began studying how and why some Americans ended up taking on more debt than they could handle. The act of borrowing money, she learned, was growing increasingly risky and complex. As the consumer-credit industry grew, credit-card companies and mortgage lenders began to design their products to appear cheaper than they actually were. Unlike most things people buy, financial products became defined by their ever-lengthening terms and conditions: mandatory arbitration, reverse amortization, interest-rate calculations that can change at a whim, cross-default clauses and two-cycle billing, mysterious credit scores that emanate from Equifax and Experian as if from the temples of an obscurantist cult. &ldquo;The real money was in the fine print,&rdquo; Warren told me recently.</p>\n<p>Warren, who is now a senator from Massachusetts and a Democratic candidate for president, spoke to me by phone as she was making her way to New Hampshire for a campaign swing. On the trail and off, Warren depicts the rise of the consumer financial industry as part of an elemental structural shift in American life. Wealthy people and big corporations were not just eating up a growing share of the pie; they had rigged the marketplace to help them do it. All that fine print didn&rsquo;t just shift billions upon billions of dollars into the hands of lenders, Warren argued. It shifted power. Lenders could more safely harvest a few dollars in fees from the checking account of each customer, even when doing so broke the law, when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html\">mandatory arbitration clauses in the fine print prohibit customers from joining together</a> in a class action to get their money back. Brokers could more easily push a family to a higher-cost mortgage, even when they qualified for a cheaper one, if the family believed they were getting the best possible deal. The increase in debt-financed consumption helped paper over the stagnating wages of the middle class and the growing gap between the rich and everyone else. But it was also driving an epidemic of social misery: bankruptcy and lost homes, anxiety and shame.</p>\n<p>In her research, Warren found that people got in over their heads not because they were greedy or lacked self-discipline, but because they were being outmatched by a sophisticated and often predatory industry of lenders. Warren recalled being struck by &ldquo;the number of people who said, in our interviews, &lsquo;I never understood my payment would go up on that&rsquo; or &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand I owed more on my house than I paid for it,&rsquo; &rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Even after they had seen a lawyer and declared bankruptcy, they still didn&rsquo;t understand what had happened.&rdquo; In <a href=\"https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/5/unsafe-at-any-rate/\">a 2007 article titled &ldquo;Unsafe at Any Rate,&rdquo;</a> Warren proposed the creation of a new regulatory agency to oversee consumer-credit products. When she lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill after the financial crisis, Warren would take them a selection of credit-card agreements. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d lay three of them down on the table, and I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Tell me which one is the cheapest credit card.&rsquo; &rdquo; None could.</p>\n<p>Warren and other consumer advocates argued that payday lenders built their industry on a similar sleight of hand. They marketed themselves as lenders of last resort, offering emergency loans for a broken-down car or an unexpected medical bill. But according to Nick Bourke, a former financial-services consultant who now directs consumer-finance research at the Pew Charitable Trusts, what fed the industry&rsquo;s growth were not emergency expenses but the increasingly unstable incomes of the working poor. As their hourly wages fluctuated at the whims of workplace-optimization software, payday-loan customers &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/video/2013/payday-loans-explained\">typically white women earning around $30,000, according to Pew&rsquo;s research</a> &mdash; borrowed to pay their rent or electric bills. The average customer paid $55 in fees to borrow $375, due on their next payday. But most found that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to repay the loan after two weeks. They took out another loan to cover the first, and usually another.</p>\n<p>Consumer advocates called this cycle <a href=\"http://stopthedebttrap.org/\">a &ldquo;debt trap&rdquo;</a> and argued that payday lenders, much like credit-card companies, disguised the true costs of their products. Store clerks emphasized the small-seeming fees and pushed customers to roll their old loans into new ones, so that the fees snowballed, eventually exceeding the cost of the original loan. While most banks made money by finding customers who could repay their debts on time, payday lenders made money by finding customers who couldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;If borrowers repaid loans in just two weeks and walked away as advertised, lenders would go out of business,&rdquo; Bourke says.</p>\n<p>Improbably, the payday-loan industry earned a fortune from the working poor. The short loan terms and frequent rollovers pumped out profits faster than conventional lending, requiring less capital and yielding bigger profits. Beginning in the 1990s, federal and state deregulation set off a payday-loan gold rush. In states like Utah, North Carolina and Missouri, the number of storefront lenders tripled or even quintupled practically overnight. Lenders <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=694141\">clustered around big military bases throughout the South</a>, where they could target service members, most of them young, low-paid and living the kind of peripatetic lives that made them ideal payday-loan customers. &ldquo;Anybody with $50,000 can get into payday lending in some states,&rdquo; one former payday-loan executive told me. &ldquo;The model is designed to print money.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some of the largest payday lenders built national franchises and took their companies public during the frothy 2000s, fueling further expansion. Silicon Valley venture capitalists stepped in, building lead-generation databases and online platforms to compete against traditional storefront lenders. So did Wall Street. In recent years, leading private-equity firms, including Golden Gate Capital and the Fortress Investment Group, <a href=\"http://pestakeholder.org/report/private-equity-piles-into-payday-lending-and-other-subprime-consumer-lending/\">have acquired or bought stakes in almost two dozen short-term lenders</a>. Payday lenders, which once operated on the fringes of the financial world, are now in unlikely alignment with the titans of high finance: Each has benefited enormously from Trump&rsquo;s deregulatory policies, which Trump has cast as populist and his likely 2020 opponents have assailed as plutocratic.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you think about structures that perpetuate racial and economic inequality &mdash; this is it,&rdquo; says Diane Standaert, the director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending, which advocates tighter regulation on lenders. &ldquo;These are entities that suck up billions of dollars a year from people making $25,000 a year. And it&rsquo;s going into the pockets of the wealthiest people in the world.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Mulvaney began his</strong> political career in the heart of payday-loan country, just as the industry&rsquo;s headlong expansion began running into serious resistance. In South Carolina, short-term lending is not only a significant industry but also a political force. Payday lenders dole out more campaign money than traditional banks do, most of it to committees controlled by the Legislature&rsquo;s powerful Republican leaders. The country&rsquo;s biggest payday-loan chain, Advance America, is based in Spartanburg, where a local business school is named for a company founder, George Dean Johnson Jr., and the company&rsquo;s chief spokesman, Jamie Fulmer, serves part time as a city councilman.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney, who worked as a lawyer, restaurateur and real estate developer before entering politics, ran for a seat in the State House in 2006, when South Carolina had around a thousand payday lenders, one of the highest densities in the country. Two years later, Mulvaney won election to the State Senate, in a district that stretched along South Carolina&rsquo;s border with North Carolina, which had outlawed payday lenders in 2001. Mulvaney, a junior lawmaker, received only a sprinkle of checks from the payday-loan industry during his time in the Legislature. But payday lenders did a brisk business in and around Mulvaney&rsquo;s district, throwing up billboards along Interstate 77 and advertising in the Charlotte phone book to draw customers from across the border. For some constituents, particularly in rural areas of the district, payday lending served as a de facto line of credit. Emma Doyle, a close aide since Mulvaney&rsquo;s time in Congress, told me that his views of the payday-loan industry were shaped, in part, by hearing from lower-income constituents who relied on payday lenders when they had nowhere else to go. &ldquo;It was something he had worked on, something he had heard from a lot of people about,&rdquo; Doyle told me. &ldquo;Not everybody ends up in a debt trap. Not everyone ends up saying, &lsquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t taken this out&rsquo; or &lsquo;I wish it hadn&rsquo;t been available to me.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n<p>North Carolina&rsquo;s expulsion of payday lenders was the first in a series of setbacks for the industry that unfolded through the decade. In 2005, federal officials began cracking down on <a href=\"https://uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/Payday_Lending_2001_USPIRG.pdf\">&ldquo;rent-a-bank&rdquo; schemes</a>, in which payday-loan companies formed partnerships with banks in states that had loose lending regulations to export high-interest loans to customers in states that banned them. A year later, with tens of thousands of American soldiers deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress passed the Military Lending Act, imposing a rate cap on payday loans and auto-title loans to service members. Over Mulvaney&rsquo;s first two years in the Legislature, several other states passed new restrictions on lenders, and proposals to follow suit were among the most hotly debated legislation in the Capitol.</p>\n<p>At first, payday-loan supporters successfully bottled up the bills in committee. But in 2008, as the subprime-mortgage implosion set off a global financial crisis, the politics of financial regulation abruptly shifted. Public anger against lenders spread around the country, and amid the wreckage of lost homes and destroyed savings, the wave engulfed payday lenders too. In the November elections, Democrats in Washington began drafting the Dodd-Frank reform act, adopting Warren&rsquo;s idea for a new consumer financial regulator. Even in South Carolina, there were calls to ban payday lending altogether. &ldquo;You had a lot of horror stories out there about people carrying multiple loans and taking out one loan to pay off another loan,&rdquo; recalls Wes Hayes, a Republican who served with Mulvaney in the State Senate.</p>\n<p>Hayes began working with Advance America and other lenders on a compromise that would limit South Carolinians to taking out one payday loan at a time. &ldquo;We were trying to break the cycle,&rdquo; he told me. For payday lenders, Hayes&rsquo;s bill was also a kind of breakwater, intended to absorb the anger building against the industry in South Carolina and elsewhere. Advance America pushed lawmakers to support the compromise. Johnson, the company&rsquo;s co-founder, personally lobbied the state&rsquo;s governor at the time, Mark Sanford, according to a former Sanford aide. &ldquo;It strengthened the consumer protections that were in our state, but also allowed consumers access to the credit they needed,&rdquo; Fulmer says.</p>\n<p>But not everyone was convinced. In the Senate, Mulvaney belonged to a small group of young conservatives who called themselves the William Wallace Caucus, after the Scottish freedom fighter portrayed in &ldquo;Braveheart.&rdquo; Like a growing number of conservatives around the country, they viewed the Republican Party of the Bush years as adrift from small-government principles. In the depths of the recession, Mulvaney sided with Sanford against their fellow Republicans when Sanford tried to reject federal stimulus money &mdash; funds that Mulvaney cast as an ominous expansion of big-government power. Hayes&rsquo;s payday-loan bill came to the floor a few weeks later. Sanford, the aide told me, was skeptical that borrowers were being misled by payday lenders and made clear he would veto the bill. Republicans in the Legislature laid plans to override him. In May 2009, Hayes&rsquo;s compromise passed overwhelmingly.</p>\n<p>Only four members of the State Senate voted against the legislation. One of them was Mulvaney. A few months after the vote, he announced that he would run for Congress, joining the Tea Party wave that was building around the country.</p>\n<p><strong>The C.F.P.B. that</strong> opened its doors in 2011 had been carefully constructed to survive the fight ahead. Warren and her colleagues wanted a bureau that could resist the political pressures that, in their view, had cowed and co-opted other financial regulators leading up to the crisis. The C.F.P.B. was funded directly by the Federal Reserve, insulating it from congressional appropriators. The sole political appointee was its director, who would serve a five-year term and could be fired only for wrongdoing. Facing stiff Republican congressional resistance to the prospect of Warren taking the job, Obama ultimately picked Richard Cordray, a cerebral former Ohio attorney general.</p>\n<p>The new agency had the feel of a start-up. Cordray, a Democrat, made an effort to recruit broadly, bringing in financial-industry veterans and former prosecutors, but Warren&rsquo;s creation inevitably attracted Warren acolytes and veterans of consumer-advocacy groups, many of whom landed in the enforcement division. As the human and financial costs of the subprime-mortgage crash mounted, the new bureau was inundated with whistle-blower tips and consumer complaints. Cordray and his leadership team initially planned to focus on the biggest consumer-finance players, like mortgage lenders and credit-card companies; payday lenders were a relatively small industry compared with Wall Street. But it was growing quickly: The crisis had been good for business, pulling more middle-class families into the payday-loan market. And unlike banks, payday lenders were unregulated by the federal government. &ldquo;It was affecting a lot of people at the margins who could least afford to run into trouble,&rdquo; Cordray told me recently.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the C.F.P.B. began conducting supervisory exams of payday lenders, a process that required them to open up their offices and books, and sometimes yielded evidence of predatory lending for the bureau&rsquo;s enforcement team to take up. A company called Ace Cash Express, investigators found, harassed overdue borrowers by using phony legal threats. The investigation yielded a potent illustration of the debt trap: Ace Cash&rsquo;s training manual, which instructed employees to pressure borrowers into paying off overdue loans by taking out new ones, illustrated its customer-service doctrine with a graphic resembling a recycling symbol, with <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-ace-cash-express-for-pushing-payday-borrowers-into-cycle-of-debt/\">one &ldquo;short-term&rdquo; loan fueling the next in an endless loop of debt</a>.</p>\n<p>Other investigations underscored the contempt that some lenders had for their new regulator. When the bureau informed Cash America, a major firm based in Texas, that it planned to conduct an examination, employees there <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-takes-action-against-payday-lender-for-robo-signing/\">shredded internal records and deleted recordings of phone calls with customers</a>. Managers at the firm instructed employees to mislead the bureau&rsquo;s examiners about its sales practices and stripped its call center of posters exhorting the employees to collect on debts. (The bureau later found that Cash America had illegally overcharged hundreds of service members and their families and ordered the company to pay a $5 million fine.)</p>\n<p>The exams also provided an insider&rsquo;s view of the historically insular industry, data that in turn guided the bureau&rsquo;s enforcement lawyers and regulation writers. <a href=\"http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201304_cfpb_payday-dap-whitepaper.pdf\">A bureau study of 15 million loans</a> found that customers who kept rolling their loans over &mdash; taking out 10 or more a year &mdash; were the cream of the payday-loan industry, generating three-quarters of all loan fees. Advance America and other lenders disputed these findings, arguing that the bureau had undercounted one-time borrowers. But Cordray and his team saw evidence of a major regulatory failure: State-level reform efforts had largely failed to rein in the industry&rsquo;s most abusive features, like debt traps. And lenders were devising ever-more-sophisticated tools to evade state regulation altogether: Some incorporated on Indian reservations or in offshore financial havens, selling loans online and claiming to be immune from state laws entirely.</p>\n<p>A faction in the bureau advocated a strategy of hyperaggressive enforcement lawsuits to bring the industry to heel. Instead, Cordray settled on a two-pronged strategy, according to current and former bureau employees. Enforcement lawyers would begin prosecuting the industry&rsquo;s worst scofflaws, especially the growing online lenders. But at the same time, the bureau would develop a package of tough rules that would apply to everyone.</p>\n<p>In 2015, the agency outlined its core proposal, one that would eliminate debt traps: <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-considers-proposal-to-end-payday-debt-traps/\">an ability-to-repay rule</a>. Under such a rule, payday lenders would have to check whether borrowers could afford to pay back a loan before making it in the first place &mdash; a short-term loan would have to actually be short-term, not just bait for a debt trap. The rule would have real teeth: If companies lent money to people who couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay it back, they could face prosecution and sizable fines. &ldquo;We wanted to prompt reform in the industry,&rdquo; Cordray says. &ldquo;If they couldn&rsquo;t reform their products, some of them would get out of the industry altogether.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/magazine/americans-jobs-poverty-homeless.html\"><em>[Why jobs aren&rsquo;t the solution to poverty.]</em></a></p>\n<p>The backlash against the proposal was severe. Dennis Shaul, who leads the Community Financial Services Association of America, an industry trade group founded by Advance America and other payday lenders, told me that his group would have supported some limits on repeat borrowing. But the ability-to-repay rule, his members felt, was designed to shrink their industry. &ldquo;We felt their solution was arbitrary,&rdquo; Shaul says. The association worked with Jones Day, a powerhouse Washington law firm, to mount an all-fronts legal challenge. Advance America accused consumer-advocacy groups like the Center for Responsible Lending, whose alumni <a href=\"https://www.advanceamerica.net/news/consumer-issues/politico-cfpb-worked-hand-in-hand-with-consumer-activists-to-draft-regulations\">dotted the bureau and who had consulted closely with it on the proposed rules</a>, of &ldquo;infiltrating&rdquo; the C.F.P.B. (The revolving door, of course, spun both ways: Shaul was recruited by the industry after working for Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was an author of Dodd-Frank, and dozens of former bureau officials have gone on to work for the financial industry.) The industry mustered studies, including one by the bureau&rsquo;s former assistant research director, finding that the bureau&rsquo;s proposal would cut revenue so drastically as to put storefront companies out of business.</p>\n<p>Not everyone in the industry agreed with this argument. The former payday-loan executive told me that most of his old industry would have survived under the ability-to-repay rule, but with a less lucrative business model. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d still make money,&rdquo; the former executive says. &ldquo;It would just be less money.&rdquo; But payday lenders found a willing audience in Congress, where Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee &mdash; including Mulvaney, who joined the committee in 2013 &mdash; had worked aggressively to <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-cfpb-under-fire-20170407-story.html\">bring Washington&rsquo;s new watchdog to heel</a>. The committee was led by Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who regarded the bureau as a constitutional abomination and Cordray as a &ldquo;benevolent financial-product dictator,&rdquo; as he put it in one hearing. Hensarling <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/cfpb_staff_report.pdf\">hammered Cordray with subpoenas</a> and accused the bureau of mismanagement and waste. Mulvaney regarded Hensarling as a mentor and held similar views about the bureau&rsquo;s structure and powers. &ldquo;Some of us would like to get rid of it,&rdquo; Mulvaney told a reporter in 2014. At oversight hearings, Mulvaney questioned Cordray relentlessly about the bureau&rsquo;s budget and his payday-loan proposal, even introducing a bill that would <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/05/the-pending-crackdown-on-payday-lending-is-causing-the-exact-washington-argument-youd-expect/?utm_term=.8c1ae45ae11e\">allow states to opt out from the ability-to-repay rule for five years</a>. Payday lenders, seeing Mulvaney as an ally, donated tens of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.</p>\n<p>But as the 2016 election approached, aggressive enforcement by the C.F.P.B. and other federal regulators had cast a pall over the industry. Its money machine began to slow. That year alone, storefront-payday-loan fees plummeted by more than a quarter, according to an internal industry presentation that I obtained. The C.F.P.B. was &ldquo;biased against our industry, our product and our customers,&rdquo; Fulmer, the Advance America spokesman, told me. &ldquo;We were in a very perilous position coming to the fall of 2016.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong>Like almost every</strong> industry in America, payday lenders weren&rsquo;t prepared for a Trump victory. But it quickly became clear that his election presented an opportunity. While Trump ran as a populist, promising to tear down a &ldquo;rigged system&rdquo; &mdash; language that echoed Warren&rsquo;s own rhetoric &mdash; his anti-Wall Street rhetoric <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/where-trump-stands-on-wall-street/\">fused with a pro-Wall Street platform</a>. Advance America and others from the industry flooded Trump&rsquo;s inauguration committee with more than a million dollars in contributions.</p>\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/business/donald-trump-billionaires-cabinet-nominees.html\">stocked his cabinet with billionaires and Wall Street veterans</a>, including Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, who became his chief economic adviser. Trump, with Hensarling&rsquo;s encouragement, tapped Mulvaney to run the Office of Management and Budget. The new administration immediately came under pressure to dismiss Cordray, who had almost 18 months left in his term as C.F.P.B. director. But Cohn and others in the White House were cautious, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The move would have plunged the administration into a risky legal battle against the bureau. They also believed &mdash; correctly, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/cordray-said-to-be-announcing-bid-for-ohio-governor-on-tuesday\">it turned out</a> &mdash; that Cordray would leave the bureau to run for governor of Ohio; a high-profile firing might actually help his campaign. Cohn persuaded Trump that the Cordray problem would soon take care of itself and began identifying candidates to replace him.</p>\n<p>The list was short. To take over the agency immediately, without a time-consuming nomination fight, the White House needed someone who had already been confirmed by the Senate for another administration job. Trump settled on Mulvaney, asking him to continue as budget chief and also run the bureau until he could appoint a permanent successor there. Mulvaney, according to people close to him, did not campaign for the job but eagerly accepted it, drawn to the opportunity to remake the C.F.P.B. In November 2017, just weeks after finalizing the new ability-to-repay rule, Cordray announced his departure. Citing succession rules laid out in Dodd-Frank, Cordray tried to install a top aide, Leandra English, as the new acting director. The C.F.P.B.&rsquo;s own general counsel sided with the White House, writing a memo backing Mulvaney&rsquo;s appointment; English fought the appointment in court but ultimately quit. Mulvaney landed at the bureau just after Thanksgiving, bearing a bag full of doughnuts for his new colleagues.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney had given some thought to taking control of a bureaucracy that didn&rsquo;t necessarily want him there. He told reporters that he wanted his second agency to be more like his first, the Office of Management and Budget, where career employees are matched with appointees who serve at the president&rsquo;s pleasure. &ldquo;Maybe they didn&rsquo;t think they needed to have any political people here because a lot of the people here were political anyway,&rdquo; Mulvaney said. To become less political, Mulvaney decided, the bureau would first have to become more political. Each of the senior career officials in charge of the bureau&rsquo;s divisions, who had the title of associate director, would get a Mulvaney-appointed twin, known as a policy associate director, or PAD. To lead the PADs, Mulvaney hired Brian Johnson, a senior Hensarling aide who had helped lead the inquisition of Cordray&rsquo;s bureau. In his old job, Johnson helped draft a report &mdash; titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/11-24-15_cfpb_indirect_auto_staff_report.pdf\">Unsafe at Any Bureaucracy</a>&rdquo; &mdash; alleging that the bureau used shoddy statistics and legally questionable tactics to prosecute auto lenders accused of having racially discriminated against car buyers. In his new job, Johnson quoted Adam Smith and attacked what he called &ldquo;paternalistic&rdquo; policies. According to two former staff members, Johnson, citing an overlooked subsection of Dodd-Frank, soon revised a boilerplate description of the bureau&rsquo;s mission that was appended to the bottom of news releases. It would henceforth include a reference to eliminating &ldquo;unduly burdensome regulations.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Emma Doyle, who went on to serve with Mulvaney at the bureau, told me that the PADs were intended to make life easier for career employees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s helpful to be able to translate what the director&rsquo;s vision is back down to staff and have the staff have an intermediary interceding on their behalf,&rdquo; she said. But the appointments drew outrage inside and outside the C.F.P.B. Older agencies were accustomed to the ebb and flow of administrations, each with its own priorities. But many at the bureau believed in Warren&rsquo;s idea of a regulator that permanently represented the interest of consumers &mdash; at least, as they defined it. Each side argued that the other wanted to politicize an otherwise pristine bureaucracy. &ldquo;I originally designed the agency to be as nonpolitical as possible,&rdquo; Warren told me. &ldquo;When Mulvaney came in and brought in his own team of political hacks and put them in the agency, I was shocked.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mulvaney&rsquo;s appointments were particularly alarming to the bureau&rsquo;s supervision and enforcement staff, led by a former line attorney named Chris D&rsquo;Angelo. When Mulvaney first arrived, D&rsquo;Angelo urged his staff not to assume the worst, people who worked with him told me. But D&rsquo;Angelo grew alarmed when Mulvaney named his PAD, a midlevel administration financial-services lawyer named Eric Blankenstein, who had little experience in consumer enforcement. D&rsquo;Angelo took his case directly to Mulvaney. He argued that career enforcement officials at other financial regulatory agencies, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, reported directly to the appointed head of the agency, in order to create a clear line of accountability for enforcement decisions.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney did not budge. (D&rsquo;Angelo, who left the bureau in February, declined to comment.) After Blankenstein arrived, lawyers in the enforcement office were ordered to prepare summaries justifying every active enforcement matter &mdash; more than 100 open cases, most of them not yet public. Two days later, without warning, the bureau filed a one-sentence notice in federal court in Kansas announcing that it was withdrawing a high-profile lawsuit against a quartet of payday lenders, <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article195623824.html\">a case known as Golden Valley</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The Golden Valley</strong> lawsuit was a product of Cordray&rsquo;s enforcement strategy against scofflaw lenders. According to the bureau&rsquo;s complaint, Golden Valley and three other lenders were technically owned by the Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake, a California tribe, but were largely run out of a call center in Kansas. The lenders made payday loans over the internet, claiming that tribal ownership allowed the firm to ignore usury laws in states where its triple-digit interest rates were illegal. Using a legal theory the bureau had successfully employed in earlier cases &mdash; that trying to collect on illegal loans is itself a deceptive business practice under Dodd-Frank &mdash; the bureau <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-four-online-lenders-collecting-debts-consumers-did-not-legally-owe/\">filed suit against Golden Valley and the other lenders in the spring of 2017</a>. The sudden withdrawal mystified and worried other lawyers in the division, who wondered what implications it held for their own cases.</p>\n<p>As the grumbling spread throughout his division, Blankenstein convened a staff conference call. According to two people who were on the call, Blankenstein told them that in a previous meeting Mulvaney asked several questions about the Golden Valley case, including whether the defendants had fair notice that the bureau would view their conduct as illegal under Dodd-Frank. One person on the call later described this &ldquo;fair notice&rdquo; argument to me as one that could, in practice, justify throwing out many of the bureau&rsquo;s other payday-loan cases, which advanced much the same theory as the Golden Valley lawsuit. But strikingly, according to the two people on the call, Blankenstein claimed that he himself didn&rsquo;t know exactly why Mulvaney pulled the case.</p>\n<p>Some career employees saw a kind of strategic ambiguity at work, designed to muddle decision-making and insulate Mulvaney as he neutered the agency&rsquo;s enforcement work. The bureau&rsquo;s enforcement lawyers typically spent months or years developing cases from the bureau&rsquo;s complaint database or from information garnered from supervisory exams. In a memo to the staff, Mulvaney pledged to prioritize enforcement according to the volume of consumer complaints the bureau received, nearly a third of which related to debt collection and only 2 percent of which concerned payday lending. But bureau employees told me it was difficult to discern which particular cases and legal theories Mulvaney might allow to go forward, casting a chill over the work. Where Cordray had allowed lower-ranking enforcement lawyers to present cases to him directly, Mulvaney required lawyers to present their cases through Blankenstein, and bureau employees told me they had little sense of whether Blankenstein was arguing for them or against them when he took cases to Mulvaney. Craig Cowie, a former bureau enforcement lawyer who supervised several major payday-loan cases, including the one against Golden Valley, worked under Mulvaney for six months. &ldquo;I never met him,&rdquo; Cowie told me. &ldquo;I was never even in the same room as him.&rdquo; (Cowie declined to discuss any specific case, citing confidentiality rules.) &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t recall him ever visiting enforcement,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>By February, Mulvaney had spread a kind of bureaucratic fog across his new agency. He moved the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity from Blankenstein&rsquo;s enforcement division to his own director&rsquo;s office, frustrating coordination between the bureau&rsquo;s experts on discriminatory lending and the lawyers who enforced the law. He took responsibility for coordinating the bureau&rsquo;s oversight of the Military Lending Act away from the bureau&rsquo;s service member affairs chief &mdash; a revered retired Army colonel &mdash; and gave it to a young aide with little experience. Cordray sometimes wouldn&rsquo;t end a meeting until everyone in the room had weighed in on the matter at hand. Mulvaney, by contrast, began restricting more meetings to senior officials. The move was not atypical of federal agencies. But, employees told me, the effect was that information flowed up the chain of command and rarely back down. The practice also provided protection: Mulvaney&rsquo;s team faced a torrent of leaks from within the bureau and intense scrutiny from without, as consumer groups demanded Mulvaney and Johnson&rsquo;s calendars and email correspondence. One group, Allied Progress, filed more than 250 public-records requests during Mulvaney&rsquo;s tenure.</p>\n<p>If secrecy served to protect Mulvaney, it also made the C.F.P.B. even less efficient, worsening just the kind of management problems Mulvaney had, in theory, set out to combat. Junior staff members played endless games of telephone as they tried to suss out Mulvaney&rsquo;s marching orders. &ldquo;You had to have a meeting after the meeting so that people would know what was decided,&rdquo; one former employee told me. (Mulvaney and Johnson ultimately compromised, allowing junior staff members to dial into more meetings.) Cordray had allowed enforcement lawyers to send out a civil investigative demand &mdash; a kind of noncriminal subpoena &mdash; with the approval of a midlevel supervisor. Bureau lawyers told me that the practice allowed them to make narrower, less burdensome requests of lenders, because they had to jump through fewer hoops to ask for more. But Mulvaney viewed the requests as an onerous demand of the lenders who received them &mdash; to be used only by bureau lawyers as a last resort. All civil demands had to go through Blankenstein. Over the coming months, the pace of investigations would slow drastically.</p>\n<p>Mulvaney presented his decisions as part of an earnest effort to fulfill the bureau&rsquo;s stated mission. He was not trying to undermine the bureau, he argued, but operate it within the plain black letter of Dodd-Frank. &ldquo;I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the bureau to protect consumers,&rdquo; he wrote to the staff in one memo. &ldquo;But we will no longer go beyond that mandate.&rdquo; To career employees, however, Mulvaney&rsquo;s crusade against statutory deviation increasingly felt like an ideological publicity stunt, one that came at the expense of the agency&rsquo;s ostensible mission. Mulvaney commenced a lengthy effort to change the bureau&rsquo;s name, reasoning that Dodd-Frank had technically created something called the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. &ldquo;C.F.P.B. doesn&rsquo;t exist,&rdquo; he told bankers at a conference in April. &ldquo;C.F.P.B. has never existed.&rdquo; A new working group was convened to execute Mulvaney&rsquo;s decision, while staff members were prodded to begin using the new name on internal documents. Mulvaney appeared not to consider the vast costs of rewritten paperwork and compliance procedures that a renaming might place on the banks and on other businesses the bureau regulates: $300 million, according to an internal agency analysis later obtained by The Hill. (The name change was abandoned in December.)</p>\n<p>Nor was Mulvaney reluctant to ignore the statute when it suited him, former employees told me. In a memo that spring, he announced the creation of new bureau offices dedicated to &ldquo;cost-benefit analysis&rdquo; and &ldquo;innovation.&rdquo; Technically, neither office was prescribed by Dodd-Frank. Almost as an afterthought, Mulvaney effectively dissolved the student-loan ombudsman&rsquo;s office &mdash; a position that was mandated by Dodd-Frank. A Mulvaney spokesman told reporters that the reorganization was a &ldquo;very modest organizational chart change.&rdquo; But on the same day, Mulvaney <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/us/student-loans-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb.html\">signaled that the bureau would scale back a long-awaited overhaul of student-lending rules</a>. Last August, the ombudsman, a Cordray veteran named Seth Frotman, quit in protest, accusing Mulvaney of ignoring Dodd-Frank&rsquo;s intent. &ldquo;It felt like we were in some Ayn Rand debate club,&rdquo; Frotman told me recently.</p>\n<p><strong>As Trump appointees </strong>elsewhere around the government were learning, it takes a bureaucracy to deconstruct one, and in all the speed and confusion, some of Mulvaney&rsquo;s own priorities began to suffer. By the spring, months after he announced that the bureau would reconsider Cordray&rsquo;s ability-to-repay rule, little apparent progress had been made. One problem, according to two former lawyers with the agency, was that Mulvaney and Johnson had more experience interrogating regulatory agencies than running them. Mulvaney had first asked the head of the research, markets and regulations division, a former financial-industry lawyer named David Silberman, if he could simply delay the new payday-loan rule. &ldquo;They thought they could come in and snap their fingers,&rdquo; a former lawyer there told me. But the law lays out a lengthy, nuanced procedure for writing or revising federal rules. In a joint memo with the legal division, according to a former staff member, Silberman&rsquo;s team warned Mulvaney that he had little basis on which to delay Cordray&rsquo;s rule and that he would most likely lose in court. Mulvaney had good reason to listen to them. As Trump officials at other agencies tried to roll back environmental and other regulations, they were losing in court at an embarrassingly high rate; in many cases, judges slapped down the administration for failing to follow proper rule-making procedures.</p>\n<p>Next, a team in Silberman&rsquo;s division was asked to devise arguments in favor of replacing the Cordray rule with a new rule, one that would challenge the underpinnings of Cordray&rsquo;s regulation. The work was inherently awkward: There were no new studies or industry data that might provide a basis to replace the rule, meaning they would have to attack their own analysis of the payday-loan industry. Most of the original authors were recused from the work, leaving a bare-bones team of about a half-dozen people to finish the job. &ldquo;You would be arguing against yourself,&rdquo; a former employee in Silberman&rsquo;s division told me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be saying, &lsquo;Everything I argued last year, I&rsquo;d have to say I was wrong about.&rsquo; &rdquo; By the spring, Silberman&rsquo;s division had begun generating timelines and option memos for the bureau&rsquo;s senior staff members, including proposals to get rid of the rule&rsquo;s central feature, requiring payday lenders to make sure people can repay their loans.</p>\n<p>Yet Mulvaney and his deputies provided little feedback or direction on the proposals, according to former Silberman staff members I spoke with. &ldquo;It was radio silence from them on what direction they wanted to take,&rdquo; the former staff member told me. The process stalled. Payday lenders, who had expected quick action from Mulvaney, began to panic. Cordray&rsquo;s ability-to-repay rule would go into full effect in August 2019, in a little more than a year. Mulvaney&rsquo;s team might come up with a new rule before August, but it might not, and in the meantime payday lenders would have no choice but to reconfigure their businesses &mdash; or shut them down &mdash; to prepare for the old one. Shaul, the leader of the Community Financial Services Association, told me that he had difficulty getting any sense of where the bureau was headed. &ldquo;I was not able to get to see Mulvaney,&rdquo; Shaul told me. &ldquo;I was hoping we could convince Mulvaney to repeal that rule and craft a new rule.&rdquo; What they needed was certainty, or at minimum some kind of delay. As months passed without any word, Shaul told me, his members were increasingly set on suing the agency.</p>\n<p>What happened next underscores some of the absurdity and complexity of turning an agency inside out. In early April, Johnson granted Shaul an introductory meeting at the agency&rsquo;s headquarters. At the last second, Shaul emailed to say he would be bringing Chris Vergonis, one of the association&rsquo;s lawyers at Jones Day &mdash; and one of the people who would prepare any lawsuit against the agency. His presence was potentially dangerous for Mulvaney&rsquo;s team; it could raise questions about whether the bureau was improperly coordinating with the industry. According to notes of the meeting, taken by a career bureau employee and obtained by the consumer group Public Citizen, Shaul told Johnson that the association had in fact been preparing to sue the C.F.P.B. to stop Cordray&rsquo;s rule but now believed that it would be better to work with the bureau to write a new one. With the Cordray rule looming, Shaul stressed, they would need to move quickly.</p>\n<p>A person familiar with the meeting, who asked for anonymity because of the legal sensitivities involved, told me that Shaul and Vergonis kept pushing for details of the new rule and at one point asked outright what reaction the bureau would have to a lawsuit. According to the staff notes, Johnson replied carefully, as a good lawyer would; it would be inappropriate for him to discuss either the rule or the lawsuit, he told them. Shaul gave me a similar account. &ldquo;I found them so cautious as to preclude our having any real discussion,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;We came away from the meeting thinking that we were not going to get many answers.&rdquo; Four days later, the Community Financial Services Association and another industry group filed suit against the bureau.</p>\n<p>The C.F.P.B.&rsquo;s response was atypical of a regulatory agency. In mid-May, the bureau&rsquo;s lawyers called Vergonis with a proposal: They now wanted to <a href=\"https://business.cch.com/BFLD/CFSA-v-CFPB-LitigationStayMotion-05312018.pdf\">in effect join forces with the industry</a>, by asking a judge to stay both the compliance date of Cordray&rsquo;s rule and the lawsuit. In a kind of regulatory jujitsu, the bureau would cite Mulvaney&rsquo;s own decision to reconsider the Cordray rule as an excuse to stop the clock on the August 2019 implementation. There was just too much fog. &ldquo;The bureau&rsquo;s decision to initiate rule making to reconsider the payday rule creates inherent uncertainty,&rdquo; the bureau lawyers and Vergonis&rsquo;s team wrote in court papers filed later that month. &ldquo;There is no way to know whether plaintiffs&rsquo; members will ultimately need to comply with the payday rule, a modified payday rule or no rule at all.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The bureau still had not explained what kind of rule it planned to propose, much less implement, and in June, a Texas judge rejected the request for a stay of the compliance date. But that October, the C.F.P.B. announced that its new rule would indeed target the ability-to-repay requirement. Not long after, the judge agreed to grant the stay, in effect delaying the core of Cordray&rsquo;s old rule. Inside the bureau, according to two former employees and an industry lawyer I spoke with, the regulation-writing team lurched into high gear, rushing to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/payday-loans-rules-cfpb.html\">deliver what the bureau had promised</a>. The industry had won what it needed most: time.</p>\n<p><strong>Almost from the</strong> moment Mulvaney arrived at the C.F.P.B., rumors ricocheted around Washington that Trump was eyeing him as a future White House chief of staff. Mulvaney denied these rumors with the studied self-deprecation of a man whose star was on the rise. But by the time the White House had settled on a nominee to succeed Mulvaney at the C.F.P.B. &mdash; Kathleen Kraninger, his deputy in the budget office &mdash; in June, Mulvaney was going into the bureau&rsquo;s offices only twice a week. C.F.P.B. staff members were just as likely to catch a glimpse of him on television: Mulvaney&rsquo;s dual agency hats made him an in-demand guest on cable shows, where he capably defended Trump against the day&rsquo;s mini-scandal. The president reportedly enjoyed watching him butt heads with cable hosts, and despite a packed schedule, Mulvaney found time to polish his skills. In April, after a contentious morning Senate hearing where he made headlines sparring with Warren, he boarded an evening flight to Los Angeles. There, he spent most of two days in media training with Frank Luntz, the famed Republican messaging guru and a friend dating back to Mulvaney&rsquo;s time in the South Carolina Legislature. (A spokesman for Mulvaney told me that Luntz donated his services.)</p>\n<p>Mulvaney continued to give speeches at financial-industry conferences, issuing sweeping pronouncements of bureau policy and often taking aim at Warren, a favorite target of his boss. When Warren sent Mulvaney letters demanding information about his conversations with payday lenders or his decision to freeze the bureau&rsquo;s data-collection efforts, a former employee told me, Mulvaney&rsquo;s team would take special relish in devising confrontational replies. Mulvaney and his staff members, for their part, viewed their tussles with Warren as a way to deliver the senator an unpleasant taste of her own medicine &mdash; an object lesson in the unaccountable bureaucracy that she had birthed and that he was remaking according to a different vision. &ldquo;The bureau is not going anywhere,&rdquo; Mulvaney told a conference of mortgage bankers in October. &ldquo;There is no appetite on Capitol Hill for getting rid of the bureau. We are here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But within the walls Warren had so carefully constructed, the bricks began to loosen. Over the last year, Mulvaney&rsquo;s temporary hiring freeze has turned into an indefinite one, <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2018/04/06/cfpb-staffing-drops-for-4th-straight-quarter-longest-since-agency-opened/\">slowly shrinking the C.F.P.B.&rsquo;s staff by attrition</a>. Bureau news releases, once packed with colorful details about abusive lending practices, have been toned down to dry legalese. <a href=\"https://consumerfed.org/reports/dormant-the-consumer-financial-protection-bureaus-law-enforcement-program-in-decline/\">According to a report</a> by Christopher Peterson, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, enforcement at the bureau appears to have dwindled radically. In 2018, the bureau announced just 11 lawsuits or settlements, less than a third of the number during Cordray&rsquo;s last year. In the months since Mulvaney reorganized the Office of Fair Lending, the bureau has not brought a single case alleging illegal discrimination. While Mulvaney pledged data-driven enforcement, his bureau brought only one case against debt collectors, who account for more complaints to the C.F.P.B. than almost any other industry. Where Mulvaney or his successor have allowed cases to go forward, lenders have often settled with lowered fines or none at all. When the bureau settled a three-year prosecution of a group of payday lenders called NDG Enterprise &mdash; which found that the group had falsely threatened American customers with arrest and imprisonment if they failed to repay loans &mdash; NDG walked away without paying a cent.</p>\n<p>After Trump announced in December that he was promoting Mulvaney to the top staff job in his administration, senior White House officials told reporters that he was the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;original Plan B.&rdquo; As Trump&rsquo;s acting White House chief of staff, Mulvaney sits &mdash; however temporarily &mdash; at Washington&rsquo;s bureaucratic apex, with influence far beyond the C.F.P.B. In the months leading up to the announcement, Mulvaney sometimes brushed off questions about his ambitions by joking that he was busy enough running two agencies. Now, in a sense, he runs them all.</p>",

                "text": "Typography by Tyler Comrie\nOne rainy afternoon early in February 2018, a procession of consumer experts and activists made their way to the headquarters of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington to meet Mick Mulvaney, then the bureau\u2019s acting director. The building \u2014 an aging Brutalist layer cake, selected by the bureau\u2019s founders for the aspirational symbolism of its proximity to the White House, one block away \u2014 was under renovation, and so each visitor in turn trudged around to a side entrance. Inside the building, Mulvaney had begun another kind of reconstruction, one that would shift the balance of power between the politically influential industries that lend money and the hundreds of millions of Americans who borrow it.\nThree months earlier, President Trump installed Mulvaney, a former congressman from South Carolina, as the C.F.P.B.\u2019s acting director. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the agency in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, envisioned it as a kind of economic equalizer for American consumers, a counter to the country\u2019s rising structural inequality. Republicans had come to view her creation as a \u201crogue agency\u201d with \u201cdictatorial powers unique in the American republic,\u201d as the party\u2019s 2016 platform put it. In Congress, Mulvaney had established himself as an outspoken enemy of the bureau, describing it, memorably, as a \u201cjoke\u201d in \u201ca sick, sad kind of way\u201d and sponsoring legislation to abolish it.\nSome of those invited to the meeting in February had picketed outside the bureau\u2019s headquarters on Mulvaney\u2019s first day at work. Their unease had only grown as Mulvaney ordered a hiring freeze, put new enforcement cases on hold and sent the Federal Reserve, which funds the C.F.P.B., a budget request for zero dollars, saying the bureau could make do with the money it had on hand. Within weeks, Mulvaney announced that he would reconsider one of the bureau\u2019s major long-term initiatives: rules to restrict payday loans, products that are marketed to the working poor as an emergency lifeline but frequently leave them buried in debt. \u201cAnybody who thinks that a Trump-administration C.F.P.B. would be the same as an Obama-administration C.F.P.B. is simply being na\u00efve,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters. \u201cElections have consequences at every agency.\u201d\nMulvaney was also aware that appearances have consequences. For agency heads, it is important to appear open to all points of view about their regulatory decisions, especially if they end up having to defend them in court. In February, he agreed to meet with his critics in person. Thirty or so people gathered around a conference table as rain lashed the windows. Mulvaney, who is 51, has close-cropped hair and a bulldog countenance that befits his manner. A founder of the House\u2019s hard-line Freedom Caucus, he can be sarcastic, even withering, in hearings and speeches. But Mulvaney struck a placating tone with his guests. He kept his opening remarks brief, according to six people who attended the meeting. Important things at the bureau would not change, he reassured them. \u201cI\u2019m not here to burn the place down,\u201d he insisted. Mulvaney said he did not intend to discuss his plans for the payday-loan rule with them but encouraged everyone to share their views.\nMany of Mulvaney\u2019s guests came from advocacy groups, like Americans for Financial Reform and the Center for Responsible Lending, that often did battle with Washington\u2019s powerful financial-industry lobby. But the meeting also included a dozen religious leaders, among them officials from national evangelical and Baptist organizations, whose members tend to be among Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters. These leaders viewed payday lending as not only unfair but also sinful, and they had fought against it across Trump country \u2014 in deep-red South Dakota, on the same day Trump won the presidency, voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure effectively banning payday loans. The ministers had planned carefully for their moment with Mulvaney, and for 20 minutes they took turns detailing the harm that payday lending had inflicted on their neighborhoods and congregations. Eventually they gave the floor to the Rev. Amiri B. Hooker, who led an African-American church near Mulvaney\u2019s old congressional district.\n\u201cI told him I was from Kershaw County,\u201d Hooker told me recently, recalling his exchange with Mulvaney. \u201cHe smiled and asked how were the good folks from Kershaw.\u201d When Hooker pastored in Lake City, an hour away from Kershaw, a quarter of his congregation either had taken out payday loans themselves or knew someone who had. He told Mulvaney about an 84-year-old congregant in Lake City whom, during a week that she was so sick that she missed services, he saw hobbling toward him down the street. \u201cShe said, \u2018I had to go pay my bill,\u2019 \u201d Hooker recalled. The woman had taken out a $250 loan almost three years earlier to cover her granddaughter\u2019s heating bill. She was still paying it off, Hooker told Mulvaney, at a cost of $75 a month, rolling over the loan into a new one each time.\n[How cities make money by fining the poor.]\nDespite his earlier reticence, Mulvaney seemed eager to offer his own view of how the bureau ought to operate. It wasn\u2019t up to the federal government to stop people from taking the kind of credit that suited them, he suggested: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason people should be taking these loans \u2014 but they do.\u201d He pointed out that there wasn\u2019t anyone in the room from North Carolina, where payday lending was illegal. They should plead their case to state officials. \u201cYou have a place to go to address payday loans, and it\u2019s not me,\u201d he said, according to multiple attendees. As the C.F.P.B.\u2019s acting director, he wouldn\u2019t stop enforcing the law as written. He only wanted a more efficient bureau, he explained, one steeped in evidence-based decision-making, one that educated consumers to make good decisions on their own. Mulvaney provided few details about how it would all look, but he promised the pastors he would follow up to let them know which way he decided to go on payday-loan regulation. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard from him,\u201d Hooker says.\nIn the months that followed, Mulvaney\u2019s vision for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would become clearer. This account of Mulvaney\u2019s tenure is based on interviews with more than 60 current or former bureau employees, current and former Mulvaney aides, consumer advocates and financial-industry executives and lobbyists, as well as hundreds of pages of internal bureau documents obtained by The New York Times and others. When Mulvaney took over, the fledgling C.F.P.B. was perhaps Washington\u2019s most feared financial regulator: It announced dozens of cases annually against abusive debt collectors, sloppy credit agencies and predatory lenders, and it was poised to force sweeping changes on the $30 billion payday-loan industry, one of the few corners of the financial world that operates free of federal regulation. What he left behind is an agency whose very mission is now a matter of bitter dispute. \u201cThe bureau was constructed really deliberately to protect ordinary people,\u201d says Lisa Donner, the head of Americans for Financial Reform. \u201cHe\u2019s taken it apart \u2014 dismantled it, piece by piece, brick by brick.\u201d\nMulvaney\u2019s careful campaign of deconstruction offers a case study in the Trump administration\u2019s approach to transforming Washington, one in which strategic neglect and bureaucratic self-sabotage create versions of agencies that seem to run contrary to their basic premises. According to one person who speaks with Mulvaney often, his smooth subdual of the C.F.P.B. was part of his pitch to Trump for his promotion to White House chief of staff \u2014 long one of the most powerful jobs in Washington. Mulvaney\u2019s slow-rolling attack on the bureau\u2019s enforcement and regulatory powers wasn\u2019t just one of the Trump era\u2019s most emblematic assaults on the so-called administrative state. It was also, in part, an audition.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau emerged from a liberal concern that the American political economy was increasingly defined by inequality and consumer debt. As a young academic in the 1980s, Warren began studying how and why some Americans ended up taking on more debt than they could handle. The act of borrowing money, she learned, was growing increasingly risky and complex. As the consumer-credit industry grew, credit-card companies and mortgage lenders began to design their products to appear cheaper than they actually were. Unlike most things people buy, financial products became defined by their ever-lengthening terms and conditions: mandatory arbitration, reverse amortization, interest-rate calculations that can change at a whim, cross-default clauses and two-cycle billing, mysterious credit scores that emanate from Equifax and Experian as if from the temples of an obscurantist cult. \u201cThe real money was in the fine print,\u201d Warren told me recently.\nWarren, who is now a senator from Massachusetts and a Democratic candidate for president, spoke to me by phone as she was making her way to New Hampshire for a campaign swing. On the trail and off, Warren depicts the rise of the consumer financial industry as part of an elemental structural shift in American life. Wealthy people and big corporations were not just eating up a growing share of the pie; they had rigged the marketplace to help them do it. All that fine print didn\u2019t just shift billions upon billions of dollars into the hands of lenders, Warren argued. It shifted power. Lenders could more safely harvest a few dollars in fees from the checking account of each customer, even when doing so broke the law, when mandatory arbitration clauses in the fine print prohibit customers from joining together in a class action to get their money back. Brokers could more easily push a family to a higher-cost mortgage, even when they qualified for a cheaper one, if the family believed they were getting the best possible deal. The increase in debt-financed consumption helped paper over the stagnating wages of the middle class and the growing gap between the rich and everyone else. But it was also driving an epidemic of social misery: bankruptcy and lost homes, anxiety and shame.\nIn her research, Warren found that people got in over their heads not because they were greedy or lacked self-discipline, but because they were being outmatched by a sophisticated and often predatory industry of lenders. Warren recalled being struck by \u201cthe number of people who said, in our interviews, \u2018I never understood my payment would go up on that\u2019 or \u2018I didn\u2019t understand I owed more on my house than I paid for it,\u2019 \u201d she told me. \u201cEven after they had seen a lawyer and declared bankruptcy, they still didn\u2019t understand what had happened.\u201d In a 2007 article titled \u201cUnsafe at Any Rate,\u201d Warren proposed the creation of a new regulatory agency to oversee consumer-credit products. When she lobbied lawmakers on Capitol Hill after the financial crisis, Warren would take them a selection of credit-card agreements. \u201cI\u2019d lay three of them down on the table, and I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me which one is the cheapest credit card.\u2019 \u201d None could.\nWarren and other consumer advocates argued that payday lenders built their industry on a similar sleight of hand. They marketed themselves as lenders of last resort, offering emergency loans for a broken-down car or an unexpected medical bill. But according to Nick Bourke, a former financial-services consultant who now directs consumer-finance research at the Pew Charitable Trusts, what fed the industry\u2019s growth were not emergency expenses but the increasingly unstable incomes of the working poor. As their hourly wages fluctuated at the whims of workplace-optimization software, payday-loan customers \u2014 typically white women earning around $30,000, according to Pew\u2019s research \u2014 borrowed to pay their rent or electric bills. The average customer paid $55 in fees to borrow $375, due on their next payday. But most found that they couldn\u2019t afford to repay the loan after two weeks. They took out another loan to cover the first, and usually another.\nConsumer advocates called this cycle a \u201cdebt trap\u201d and argued that payday lenders, much like credit-card companies, disguised the true costs of their products. Store clerks emphasized the small-seeming fees and pushed customers to roll their old loans into new ones, so that the fees snowballed, eventually exceeding the cost of the original loan. While most banks made money by finding customers who could repay their debts on time, payday lenders made money by finding customers who couldn\u2019t. \u201cIf borrowers repaid loans in just two weeks and walked away as advertised, lenders would go out of business,\u201d Bourke says.\nImprobably, the payday-loan industry earned a fortune from the working poor. The short loan terms and frequent rollovers pumped out profits faster than conventional lending, requiring less capital and yielding bigger profits. Beginning in the 1990s, federal and state deregulation set off a payday-loan gold rush. In states like Utah, North Carolina and Missouri, the number of storefront lenders tripled or even quintupled practically overnight. Lenders clustered around big military bases throughout the South, where they could target service members, most of them young, low-paid and living the kind of peripatetic lives that made them ideal payday-loan customers. \u201cAnybody with $50,000 can get into payday lending in some states,\u201d one former payday-loan executive told me. \u201cThe model is designed to print money.\u201d\nSome of the largest payday lenders built national franchises and took their companies public during the frothy 2000s, fueling further expansion. Silicon Valley venture capitalists stepped in, building lead-generation databases and online platforms to compete against traditional storefront lenders. So did Wall Street. In recent years, leading private-equity firms, including Golden Gate Capital and the Fortress Investment Group, have acquired or bought stakes in almost two dozen short-term lenders. Payday lenders, which once operated on the fringes of the financial world, are now in unlikely alignment with the titans of high finance: Each has benefited enormously from Trump\u2019s deregulatory policies, which Trump has cast as populist and his likely 2020 opponents have assailed as plutocratic.\n\u201cWhen you think about structures that perpetuate racial and economic inequality \u2014 this is it,\u201d says Diane Standaert, the director of state policy at the Center for Responsible Lending, which advocates tighter regulation on lenders. \u201cThese are entities that suck up billions of dollars a year from people making $25,000 a year. And it\u2019s going into the pockets of the wealthiest people in the world.\u201d\nMulvaney began his political career in the heart of payday-loan country, just as the industry\u2019s headlong expansion began running into serious resistance. In South Carolina, short-term lending is not only a significant industry but also a political force. Payday lenders dole out more campaign money than traditional banks do, most of it to committees controlled by the Legislature\u2019s powerful Republican leaders. The country\u2019s biggest payday-loan chain, Advance America, is based in Spartanburg, where a local business school is named for a company founder, George Dean Johnson Jr., and the company\u2019s chief spokesman, Jamie Fulmer, serves part time as a city councilman.\nMulvaney, who worked as a lawyer, restaurateur and real estate developer before entering politics, ran for a seat in the State House in 2006, when South Carolina had around a thousand payday lenders, one of the highest densities in the country. Two years later, Mulvaney won election to the State Senate, in a district that stretched along South Carolina\u2019s border with North Carolina, which had outlawed payday lenders in 2001. Mulvaney, a junior lawmaker, received only a sprinkle of checks from the payday-loan industry during his time in the Legislature. But payday lenders did a brisk business in and around Mulvaney\u2019s district, throwing up billboards along Interstate 77 and advertising in the Charlotte phone book to draw customers from across the border. For some constituents, particularly in rural areas of the district, payday lending served as a de facto line of credit. Emma Doyle, a close aide since Mulvaney\u2019s time in Congress, told me that his views of the payday-loan industry were shaped, in part, by hearing from lower-income constituents who relied on payday lenders when they had nowhere else to go. \u201cIt was something he had worked on, something he had heard from a lot of people about,\u201d Doyle told me. \u201cNot everybody ends up in a debt trap. Not everyone ends up saying, \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t taken this out\u2019 or \u2018I wish it hadn\u2019t been available to me.\u2019 \u201d\nNorth Carolina\u2019s expulsion of payday lenders was the first in a series of setbacks for the industry that unfolded through the decade. In 2005, federal officials began cracking down on \u201crent-a-bank\u201d schemes, in which payday-loan companies formed partnerships with banks in states that had loose lending regulations to export high-interest loans to customers in states that banned them. A year later, with tens of thousands of American soldiers deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress passed the Military Lending Act, imposing a rate cap on payday loans and auto-title loans to service members. Over Mulvaney\u2019s first two years in the Legislature, several other states passed new restrictions on lenders, and proposals to follow suit were among the most hotly debated legislation in the Capitol.\nAt first, payday-loan supporters successfully bottled up the bills in committee. But in 2008, as the subprime-mortgage implosion set off a global financial crisis, the politics of financial regulation abruptly shifted. Public anger against lenders spread around the country, and amid the wreckage of lost homes and destroyed savings, the wave engulfed payday lenders too. In the November elections, Democrats in Washington began drafting the Dodd-Frank reform act, adopting Warren\u2019s idea for a new consumer financial regulator. Even in South Carolina, there were calls to ban payday lending altogether. \u201cYou had a lot of horror stories out there about people carrying multiple loans and taking out one loan to pay off another loan,\u201d recalls Wes Hayes, a Republican who served with Mulvaney in the State Senate.\nHayes began working with Advance America and other lenders on a compromise that would limit South Carolinians to taking out one payday loan at a time. \u201cWe were trying to break the cycle,\u201d he told me. For payday lenders, Hayes\u2019s bill was also a kind of breakwater, intended to absorb the anger building against the industry in South Carolina and elsewhere. Advance America pushed lawmakers to support the compromise. Johnson, the company\u2019s co-founder, personally lobbied the state\u2019s governor at the time, Mark Sanford, according to a former Sanford aide. \u201cIt strengthened the consumer protections that were in our state, but also allowed consumers access to the credit they needed,\u201d Fulmer says.\nBut not everyone was convinced. In the Senate, Mulvaney belonged to a small group of young conservatives who called themselves the William Wallace Caucus, after the Scottish freedom fighter portrayed in \u201cBraveheart.\u201d Like a growing number of conservatives around the country, they viewed the Republican Party of the Bush years as adrift from small-government principles. In the depths of the recession, Mulvaney sided with Sanford against their fellow Republicans when Sanford tried to reject federal stimulus money \u2014 funds that Mulvaney cast as an ominous expansion of big-government power. Hayes\u2019s payday-loan bill came to the floor a few weeks later. Sanford, the aide told me, was skeptical that borrowers were being misled by payday lenders and made clear he would veto the bill. Republicans in the Legislature laid plans to override him. In May 2009, Hayes\u2019s compromise passed overwhelmingly.\nOnly four members of the State Senate voted against the legislation. One of them was Mulvaney. A few months after the vote, he announced that he would run for Congress, joining the Tea Party wave that was building around the country.\nThe C.F.P.B. that opened its doors in 2011 had been carefully constructed to survive the fight ahead. Warren and her colleagues wanted a bureau that could resist the political pressures that, in their view, had cowed and co-opted other financial regulators leading up to the crisis. The C.F.P.B. was funded directly by the Federal Reserve, insulating it from congressional appropriators. The sole political appointee was its director, who would serve a five-year term and could be fired only for wrongdoing. Facing stiff Republican congressional resistance to the prospect of Warren taking the job, Obama ultimately picked Richard Cordray, a cerebral former Ohio attorney general.\nThe new agency had the feel of a start-up. Cordray, a Democrat, made an effort to recruit broadly, bringing in financial-industry veterans and former prosecutors, but Warren\u2019s creation inevitably attracted Warren acolytes and veterans of consumer-advocacy groups, many of whom landed in the enforcement division. As the human and financial costs of the subprime-mortgage crash mounted, the new bureau was inundated with whistle-blower tips and consumer complaints. Cordray and his leadership team initially planned to focus on the biggest consumer-finance players, like mortgage lenders and credit-card companies; payday lenders were a relatively small industry compared with Wall Street. But it was growing quickly: The crisis had been good for business, pulling more middle-class families into the payday-loan market. And unlike banks, payday lenders were unregulated by the federal government. \u201cIt was affecting a lot of people at the margins who could least afford to run into trouble,\u201d Cordray told me recently.\nIn 2012, the C.F.P.B. began conducting supervisory exams of payday lenders, a process that required them to open up their offices and books, and sometimes yielded evidence of predatory lending for the bureau\u2019s enforcement team to take up. A company called Ace Cash Express, investigators found, harassed overdue borrowers by using phony legal threats. The investigation yielded a potent illustration of the debt trap: Ace Cash\u2019s training manual, which instructed employees to pressure borrowers into paying off overdue loans by taking out new ones, illustrated its customer-service doctrine with a graphic resembling a recycling symbol, with one \u201cshort-term\u201d loan fueling the next in an endless loop of debt.\nOther investigations underscored the contempt that some lenders had for their new regulator. When the bureau informed Cash America, a major firm based in Texas, that it planned to conduct an examination, employees there shredded internal records and deleted recordings of phone calls with customers. Managers at the firm instructed employees to mislead the bureau\u2019s examiners about its sales practices and stripped its call center of posters exhorting the employees to collect on debts. (The bureau later found that Cash America had illegally overcharged hundreds of service members and their families and ordered the company to pay a $5 million fine.)\nThe exams also provided an insider\u2019s view of the historically insular industry, data that in turn guided the bureau\u2019s enforcement lawyers and regulation writers. A bureau study of 15 million loans found that customers who kept rolling their loans over \u2014 taking out 10 or more a year \u2014 were the cream of the payday-loan industry, generating three-quarters of all loan fees. Advance America and other lenders disputed these findings, arguing that the bureau had undercounted one-time borrowers. But Cordray and his team saw evidence of a major regulatory failure: State-level reform efforts had largely failed to rein in the industry\u2019s most abusive features, like debt traps. And lenders were devising ever-more-sophisticated tools to evade state regulation altogether: Some incorporated on Indian reservations or in offshore financial havens, selling loans online and claiming to be immune from state laws entirely.\nA faction in the bureau advocated a strategy of hyperaggressive enforcement lawsuits to bring the industry to heel. Instead, Cordray settled on a two-pronged strategy, according to current and former bureau employees. Enforcement lawyers would begin prosecuting the industry\u2019s worst scofflaws, especially the growing online lenders. But at the same time, the bureau would develop a package of tough rules that would apply to everyone.\nIn 2015, the agency outlined its core proposal, one that would eliminate debt traps: an ability-to-repay rule. Under such a rule, payday lenders would have to check whether borrowers could afford to pay back a loan before making it in the first place \u2014 a short-term loan would have to actually be short-term, not just bait for a debt trap. The rule would have real teeth: If companies lent money to people who couldn\u2019t afford to pay it back, they could face prosecution and sizable fines. \u201cWe wanted to prompt reform in the industry,\u201d Cordray says. \u201cIf they couldn\u2019t reform their products, some of them would get out of the industry altogether.\u201d\n[Why jobs aren\u2019t the solution to poverty.]\nThe backlash against the proposal was severe. Dennis Shaul, who leads the Community Financial Services Association of America, an industry trade group founded by Advance America and other payday lenders, told me that his group would have supported some limits on repeat borrowing. But the ability-to-repay rule, his members felt, was designed to shrink their industry. \u201cWe felt their solution was arbitrary,\u201d Shaul says. The association worked with Jones Day, a powerhouse Washington law firm, to mount an all-fronts legal challenge. Advance America accused consumer-advocacy groups like the Center for Responsible Lending, whose alumni dotted the bureau and who had consulted closely with it on the proposed rules, of \u201cinfiltrating\u201d the C.F.P.B. (The revolving door, of course, spun both ways: Shaul was recruited by the industry after working for Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who was an author of Dodd-Frank, and dozens of former bureau officials have gone on to work for the financial industry.) The industry mustered studies, including one by the bureau\u2019s former assistant research director, finding that the bureau\u2019s proposal would cut revenue so drastically as to put storefront companies out of business.\nNot everyone in the industry agreed with this argument. The former payday-loan executive told me that most of his old industry would have survived under the ability-to-repay rule, but with a less lucrative business model. \u201cYou\u2019d still make money,\u201d the former executive says. \u201cIt would just be less money.\u201d But payday lenders found a willing audience in Congress, where Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee \u2014 including Mulvaney, who joined the committee in 2013 \u2014 had worked aggressively to bring Washington\u2019s new watchdog to heel. The committee was led by Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who regarded the bureau as a constitutional abomination and Cordray as a \u201cbenevolent financial-product dictator,\u201d as he put it in one hearing. Hensarling hammered Cordray with subpoenas and accused the bureau of mismanagement and waste. Mulvaney regarded Hensarling as a mentor and held similar views about the bureau\u2019s structure and powers. \u201cSome of us would like to get rid of it,\u201d Mulvaney told a reporter in 2014. At oversight hearings, Mulvaney questioned Cordray relentlessly about the bureau\u2019s budget and his payday-loan proposal, even introducing a bill that would allow states to opt out from the ability-to-repay rule for five years. Payday lenders, seeing Mulvaney as an ally, donated tens of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.\nBut as the 2016 election approached, aggressive enforcement by the C.F.P.B. and other federal regulators had cast a pall over the industry. Its money machine began to slow. That year alone, storefront-payday-loan fees plummeted by more than a quarter, according to an internal industry presentation that I obtained. The C.F.P.B. was \u201cbiased against our industry, our product and our customers,\u201d Fulmer, the Advance America spokesman, told me. \u201cWe were in a very perilous position coming to the fall of 2016.\u201d\nLike almost every industry in America, payday lenders weren\u2019t prepared for a Trump victory. But it quickly became clear that his election presented an opportunity. While Trump ran as a populist, promising to tear down a \u201crigged system\u201d \u2014 language that echoed Warren\u2019s own rhetoric \u2014 his anti-Wall Street rhetoric fused with a pro-Wall Street platform. Advance America and others from the industry flooded Trump\u2019s inauguration committee with more than a million dollars in contributions.\nTrump stocked his cabinet with billionaires and Wall Street veterans, including Gary Cohn, the former president of Goldman Sachs, who became his chief economic adviser. Trump, with Hensarling\u2019s encouragement, tapped Mulvaney to run the Office of Management and Budget. The new administration immediately came under pressure to dismiss Cordray, who had almost 18 months left in his term as C.F.P.B. director. But Cohn and others in the White House were cautious, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The move would have plunged the administration into a risky legal battle against the bureau. They also believed \u2014 correctly, as it turned out \u2014 that Cordray would leave the bureau to run for governor of Ohio; a high-profile firing might actually help his campaign. Cohn persuaded Trump that the Cordray problem would soon take care of itself and began identifying candidates to replace him.\nThe list was short. To take over the agency immediately, without a time-consuming nomination fight, the White House needed someone who had already been confirmed by the Senate for another administration job. Trump settled on Mulvaney, asking him to continue as budget chief and also run the bureau until he could appoint a permanent successor there. Mulvaney, according to people close to him, did not campaign for the job but eagerly accepted it, drawn to the opportunity to remake the C.F.P.B. In November 2017, just weeks after finalizing the new ability-to-repay rule, Cordray announced his departure. Citing succession rules laid out in Dodd-Frank, Cordray tried to install a top aide, Leandra English, as the new acting director. The C.F.P.B.\u2019s own general counsel sided with the White House, writing a memo backing Mulvaney\u2019s appointment; English fought the appointment in court but ultimately quit. Mulvaney landed at the bureau just after Thanksgiving, bearing a bag full of doughnuts for his new colleagues.\nMulvaney had given some thought to taking control of a bureaucracy that didn\u2019t necessarily want him there. He told reporters that he wanted his second agency to be more like his first, the Office of Management and Budget, where career employees are matched with appointees who serve at the president\u2019s pleasure. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t think they needed to have any political people here because a lot of the people here were political anyway,\u201d Mulvaney said. To become less political, Mulvaney decided, the bureau would first have to become more political. Each of the senior career officials in charge of the bureau\u2019s divisions, who had the title of associate director, would get a Mulvaney-appointed twin, known as a policy associate director, or PAD. To lead the PADs, Mulvaney hired Brian Johnson, a senior Hensarling aide who had helped lead the inquisition of Cordray\u2019s bureau. In his old job, Johnson helped draft a report \u2014 titled \u201cUnsafe at Any Bureaucracy\u201d \u2014 alleging that the bureau used shoddy statistics and legally questionable tactics to prosecute auto lenders accused of having racially discriminated against car buyers. In his new job, Johnson quoted Adam Smith and attacked what he called \u201cpaternalistic\u201d policies. According to two former staff members, Johnson, citing an overlooked subsection of Dodd-Frank, soon revised a boilerplate description of the bureau\u2019s mission that was appended to the bottom of news releases. It would henceforth include a reference to eliminating \u201cunduly burdensome regulations.\u201d\nEmma Doyle, who went on to serve with Mulvaney at the bureau, told me that the PADs were intended to make life easier for career employees. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to be able to translate what the director\u2019s vision is back down to staff and have the staff have an intermediary interceding on their behalf,\u201d she said. But the appointments drew outrage inside and outside the C.F.P.B. Older agencies were accustomed to the ebb and flow of administrations, each with its own priorities. But many at the bureau believed in Warren\u2019s idea of a regulator that permanently represented the interest of consumers \u2014 at least, as they defined it. Each side argued that the other wanted to politicize an otherwise pristine bureaucracy. \u201cI originally designed the agency to be as nonpolitical as possible,\u201d Warren told me. \u201cWhen Mulvaney came in and brought in his own team of political hacks and put them in the agency, I was shocked.\u201d\nMulvaney\u2019s appointments were particularly alarming to the bureau\u2019s supervision and enforcement staff, led by a former line attorney named Chris D\u2019Angelo. When Mulvaney first arrived, D\u2019Angelo urged his staff not to assume the worst, people who worked with him told me. But D\u2019Angelo grew alarmed when Mulvaney named his PAD, a midlevel administration financial-services lawyer named Eric Blankenstein, who had little experience in consumer enforcement. D\u2019Angelo took his case directly to Mulvaney. He argued that career enforcement officials at other financial regulatory agencies, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, reported directly to the appointed head of the agency, in order to create a clear line of accountability for enforcement decisions.\nMulvaney did not budge. (D\u2019Angelo, who left the bureau in February, declined to comment.) After Blankenstein arrived, lawyers in the enforcement office were ordered to prepare summaries justifying every active enforcement matter \u2014 more than 100 open cases, most of them not yet public. Two days later, without warning, the bureau filed a one-sentence notice in federal court in Kansas announcing that it was withdrawing a high-profile lawsuit against a quartet of payday lenders, a case known as Golden Valley.\nThe Golden Valley lawsuit was a product of Cordray\u2019s enforcement strategy against scofflaw lenders. According to the bureau\u2019s complaint, Golden Valley and three other lenders were technically owned by the Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake, a California tribe, but were largely run out of a call center in Kansas. The lenders made payday loans over the internet, claiming that tribal ownership allowed the firm to ignore usury laws in states where its triple-digit interest rates were illegal. Using a legal theory the bureau had successfully employed in earlier cases \u2014 that trying to collect on illegal loans is itself a deceptive business practice under Dodd-Frank \u2014 the bureau filed suit against Golden Valley and the other lenders in the spring of 2017. The sudden withdrawal mystified and worried other lawyers in the division, who wondered what implications it held for their own cases.\nAs the grumbling spread throughout his division, Blankenstein convened a staff conference call. According to two people who were on the call, Blankenstein told them that in a previous meeting Mulvaney asked several questions about the Golden Valley case, including whether the defendants had fair notice that the bureau would view their conduct as illegal under Dodd-Frank. One person on the call later described this \u201cfair notice\u201d argument to me as one that could, in practice, justify throwing out many of the bureau\u2019s other payday-loan cases, which advanced much the same theory as the Golden Valley lawsuit. But strikingly, according to the two people on the call, Blankenstein claimed that he himself didn\u2019t know exactly why Mulvaney pulled the case.\nSome career employees saw a kind of strategic ambiguity at work, designed to muddle decision-making and insulate Mulvaney as he neutered the agency\u2019s enforcement work. The bureau\u2019s enforcement lawyers typically spent months or years developing cases from the bureau\u2019s complaint database or from information garnered from supervisory exams. In a memo to the staff, Mulvaney pledged to prioritize enforcement according to the volume of consumer complaints the bureau received, nearly a third of which related to debt collection and only 2 percent of which concerned payday lending. But bureau employees told me it was difficult to discern which particular cases and legal theories Mulvaney might allow to go forward, casting a chill over the work. Where Cordray had allowed lower-ranking enforcement lawyers to present cases to him directly, Mulvaney required lawyers to present their cases through Blankenstein, and bureau employees told me they had little sense of whether Blankenstein was arguing for them or against them when he took cases to Mulvaney. Craig Cowie, a former bureau enforcement lawyer who supervised several major payday-loan cases, including the one against Golden Valley, worked under Mulvaney for six months. \u201cI never met him,\u201d Cowie told me. \u201cI was never even in the same room as him.\u201d (Cowie declined to discuss any specific case, citing confidentiality rules.) \u201cAnd I don\u2019t recall him ever visiting enforcement,\u201d he added.\nBy February, Mulvaney had spread a kind of bureaucratic fog across his new agency. He moved the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity from Blankenstein\u2019s enforcement division to his own director\u2019s office, frustrating coordination between the bureau\u2019s experts on discriminatory lending and the lawyers who enforced the law. He took responsibility for coordinating the bureau\u2019s oversight of the Military Lending Act away from the bureau\u2019s service member affairs chief \u2014 a revered retired Army colonel \u2014 and gave it to a young aide with little experience. Cordray sometimes wouldn\u2019t end a meeting until everyone in the room had weighed in on the matter at hand. Mulvaney, by contrast, began restricting more meetings to senior officials. The move was not atypical of federal agencies. But, employees told me, the effect was that information flowed up the chain of command and rarely back down. The practice also provided protection: Mulvaney\u2019s team faced a torrent of leaks from within the bureau and intense scrutiny from without, as consumer groups demanded Mulvaney and Johnson\u2019s calendars and email correspondence. One group, Allied Progress, filed more than 250 public-records requests during Mulvaney\u2019s tenure.\nIf secrecy served to protect Mulvaney, it also made the C.F.P.B. even less efficient, worsening just the kind of management problems Mulvaney had, in theory, set out to combat. Junior staff members played endless games of telephone as they tried to suss out Mulvaney\u2019s marching orders. \u201cYou had to have a meeting after the meeting so that people would know what was decided,\u201d one former employee told me. (Mulvaney and Johnson ultimately compromised, allowing junior staff members to dial into more meetings.) Cordray had allowed enforcement lawyers to send out a civil investigative demand \u2014 a kind of noncriminal subpoena \u2014 with the approval of a midlevel supervisor. Bureau lawyers told me that the practice allowed them to make narrower, less burdensome requests of lenders, because they had to jump through fewer hoops to ask for more. But Mulvaney viewed the requests as an onerous demand of the lenders who received them \u2014 to be used only by bureau lawyers as a last resort. All civil demands had to go through Blankenstein. Over the coming months, the pace of investigations would slow drastically.\nMulvaney presented his decisions as part of an earnest effort to fulfill the bureau\u2019s stated mission. He was not trying to undermine the bureau, he argued, but operate it within the plain black letter of Dodd-Frank. \u201cI intend to execute the statutory mandate of the bureau to protect consumers,\u201d he wrote to the staff in one memo. \u201cBut we will no longer go beyond that mandate.\u201d To career employees, however, Mulvaney\u2019s crusade against statutory deviation increasingly felt like an ideological publicity stunt, one that came at the expense of the agency\u2019s ostensible mission. Mulvaney commenced a lengthy effort to change the bureau\u2019s name, reasoning that Dodd-Frank had technically created something called the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cC.F.P.B. doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he told bankers at a conference in April. \u201cC.F.P.B. has never existed.\u201d A new working group was convened to execute Mulvaney\u2019s decision, while staff members were prodded to begin using the new name on internal documents. Mulvaney appeared not to consider the vast costs of rewritten paperwork and compliance procedures that a renaming might place on the banks and on other businesses the bureau regulates: $300 million, according to an internal agency analysis later obtained by The Hill. (The name change was abandoned in December.)\nNor was Mulvaney reluctant to ignore the statute when it suited him, former employees told me. In a memo that spring, he announced the creation of new bureau offices dedicated to \u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d and \u201cinnovation.\u201d Technically, neither office was prescribed by Dodd-Frank. Almost as an afterthought, Mulvaney effectively dissolved the student-loan ombudsman\u2019s office \u2014 a position that was mandated by Dodd-Frank. A Mulvaney spokesman told reporters that the reorganization was a \u201cvery modest organizational chart change.\u201d But on the same day, Mulvaney signaled that the bureau would scale back a long-awaited overhaul of student-lending rules. Last August, the ombudsman, a Cordray veteran named Seth Frotman, quit in protest, accusing Mulvaney of ignoring Dodd-Frank\u2019s intent. \u201cIt felt like we were in some Ayn Rand debate club,\u201d Frotman told me recently.\nAs Trump appointees elsewhere around the government were learning, it takes a bureaucracy to deconstruct one, and in all the speed and confusion, some of Mulvaney\u2019s own priorities began to suffer. By the spring, months after he announced that the bureau would reconsider Cordray\u2019s ability-to-repay rule, little apparent progress had been made. One problem, according to two former lawyers with the agency, was that Mulvaney and Johnson had more experience interrogating regulatory agencies than running them. Mulvaney had first asked the head of the research, markets and regulations division, a former financial-industry lawyer named David Silberman, if he could simply delay the new payday-loan rule. \u201cThey thought they could come in and snap their fingers,\u201d a former lawyer there told me. But the law lays out a lengthy, nuanced procedure for writing or revising federal rules. In a joint memo with the legal division, according to a former staff member, Silberman\u2019s team warned Mulvaney that he had little basis on which to delay Cordray\u2019s rule and that he would most likely lose in court. Mulvaney had good reason to listen to them. As Trump officials at other agencies tried to roll back environmental and other regulations, they were losing in court at an embarrassingly high rate; in many cases, judges slapped down the administration for failing to follow proper rule-making procedures.\nNext, a team in Silberman\u2019s division was asked to devise arguments in favor of replacing the Cordray rule with a new rule, one that would challenge the underpinnings of Cordray\u2019s regulation. The work was inherently awkward: There were no new studies or industry data that might provide a basis to replace the rule, meaning they would have to attack their own analysis of the payday-loan industry. Most of the original authors were recused from the work, leaving a bare-bones team of about a half-dozen people to finish the job. \u201cYou would be arguing against yourself,\u201d a former employee in Silberman\u2019s division told me. \u201cYou\u2019d be saying, \u2018Everything I argued last year, I\u2019d have to say I was wrong about.\u2019 \u201d By the spring, Silberman\u2019s division had begun generating timelines and option memos for the bureau\u2019s senior staff members, including proposals to get rid of the rule\u2019s central feature, requiring payday lenders to make sure people can repay their loans.\nYet Mulvaney and his deputies provided little feedback or direction on the proposals, according to former Silberman staff members I spoke with. \u201cIt was radio silence from them on what direction they wanted to take,\u201d the former staff member told me. The process stalled. Payday lenders, who had expected quick action from Mulvaney, began to panic. Cordray\u2019s ability-to-repay rule would go into full effect in August 2019, in a little more than a year. Mulvaney\u2019s team might come up with a new rule before August, but it might not, and in the meantime payday lenders would have no choice but to reconfigure their businesses \u2014 or shut them down \u2014 to prepare for the old one. Shaul, the leader of the Community Financial Services Association, told me that he had difficulty getting any sense of where the bureau was headed. \u201cI was not able to get to see Mulvaney,\u201d Shaul told me. \u201cI was hoping we could convince Mulvaney to repeal that rule and craft a new rule.\u201d What they needed was certainty, or at minimum some kind of delay. As months passed without any word, Shaul told me, his members were increasingly set on suing the agency.\nWhat happened next underscores some of the absurdity and complexity of turning an agency inside out. In early April, Johnson granted Shaul an introductory meeting at the agency\u2019s headquarters. At the last second, Shaul emailed to say he would be bringing Chris Vergonis, one of the association\u2019s lawyers at Jones Day \u2014 and one of the people who would prepare any lawsuit against the agency. His presence was potentially dangerous for Mulvaney\u2019s team; it could raise questions about whether the bureau was improperly coordinating with the industry. According to notes of the meeting, taken by a career bureau employee and obtained by the consumer group Public Citizen, Shaul told Johnson that the association had in fact been preparing to sue the C.F.P.B. to stop Cordray\u2019s rule but now believed that it would be better to work with the bureau to write a new one. With the Cordray rule looming, Shaul stressed, they would need to move quickly.\nA person familiar with the meeting, who asked for anonymity because of the legal sensitivities involved, told me that Shaul and Vergonis kept pushing for details of the new rule and at one point asked outright what reaction the bureau would have to a lawsuit. According to the staff notes, Johnson replied carefully, as a good lawyer would; it would be inappropriate for him to discuss either the rule or the lawsuit, he told them. Shaul gave me a similar account. \u201cI found them so cautious as to preclude our having any real discussion,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe came away from the meeting thinking that we were not going to get many answers.\u201d Four days later, the Community Financial Services Association and another industry group filed suit against the bureau.\nThe C.F.P.B.\u2019s response was atypical of a regulatory agency. In mid-May, the bureau\u2019s lawyers called Vergonis with a proposal: They now wanted to in effect join forces with the industry, by asking a judge to stay both the compliance date of Cordray\u2019s rule and the lawsuit. In a kind of regulatory jujitsu, the bureau would cite Mulvaney\u2019s own decision to reconsider the Cordray rule as an excuse to stop the clock on the August 2019 implementation. There was just too much fog. \u201cThe bureau\u2019s decision to initiate rule making to reconsider the payday rule creates inherent uncertainty,\u201d the bureau lawyers and Vergonis\u2019s team wrote in court papers filed later that month. \u201cThere is no way to know whether plaintiffs\u2019 members will ultimately need to comply with the payday rule, a modified payday rule or no rule at all.\u201d\nThe bureau still had not explained what kind of rule it planned to propose, much less implement, and in June, a Texas judge rejected the request for a stay of the compliance date. But that October, the C.F.P.B. announced that its new rule would indeed target the ability-to-repay requirement. Not long after, the judge agreed to grant the stay, in effect delaying the core of Cordray\u2019s old rule. Inside the bureau, according to two former employees and an industry lawyer I spoke with, the regulation-writing team lurched into high gear, rushing to deliver what the bureau had promised. The industry had won what it needed most: time.\nAlmost from the moment Mulvaney arrived at the C.F.P.B., rumors ricocheted around Washington that Trump was eyeing him as a future White House chief of staff. Mulvaney denied these rumors with the studied self-deprecation of a man whose star was on the rise. But by the time the White House had settled on a nominee to succeed Mulvaney at the C.F.P.B. \u2014 Kathleen Kraninger, his deputy in the budget office \u2014 in June, Mulvaney was going into the bureau\u2019s offices only twice a week. C.F.P.B. staff members were just as likely to catch a glimpse of him on television: Mulvaney\u2019s dual agency hats made him an in-demand guest on cable shows, where he capably defended Trump against the day\u2019s mini-scandal. The president reportedly enjoyed watching him butt heads with cable hosts, and despite a packed schedule, Mulvaney found time to polish his skills. In April, after a contentious morning Senate hearing where he made headlines sparring with Warren, he boarded an evening flight to Los Angeles. There, he spent most of two days in media training with Frank Luntz, the famed Republican messaging guru and a friend dating back to Mulvaney\u2019s time in the South Carolina Legislature. (A spokesman for Mulvaney told me that Luntz donated his services.)\nMulvaney continued to give speeches at financial-industry conferences, issuing sweeping pronouncements of bureau policy and often taking aim at Warren, a favorite target of his boss. When Warren sent Mulvaney letters demanding information about his conversations with payday lenders or his decision to freeze the bureau\u2019s data-collection efforts, a former employee told me, Mulvaney\u2019s team would take special relish in devising confrontational replies. Mulvaney and his staff members, for their part, viewed their tussles with Warren as a way to deliver the senator an unpleasant taste of her own medicine \u2014 an object lesson in the unaccountable bureaucracy that she had birthed and that he was remaking according to a different vision. \u201cThe bureau is not going anywhere,\u201d Mulvaney told a conference of mortgage bankers in October. \u201cThere is no appetite on Capitol Hill for getting rid of the bureau. We are here.\u201d\nBut within the walls Warren had so carefully constructed, the bricks began to loosen. Over the last year, Mulvaney\u2019s temporary hiring freeze has turned into an indefinite one, slowly shrinking the C.F.P.B.\u2019s staff by attrition. Bureau news releases, once packed with colorful details about abusive lending practices, have been toned down to dry legalese. According to a report by Christopher Peterson, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America, enforcement at the bureau appears to have dwindled radically. In 2018, the bureau announced just 11 lawsuits or settlements, less than a third of the number during Cordray\u2019s last year. In the months since Mulvaney reorganized the Office of Fair Lending, the bureau has not brought a single case alleging illegal discrimination. While Mulvaney pledged data-driven enforcement, his bureau brought only one case against debt collectors, who account for more complaints to the C.F.P.B. than almost any other industry. Where Mulvaney or his successor have allowed cases to go forward, lenders have often settled with lowered fines or none at all. When the bureau settled a three-year prosecution of a group of payday lenders called NDG Enterprise \u2014 which found that the group had falsely threatened American customers with arrest and imprisonment if they failed to repay loans \u2014 NDG walked away without paying a cent.\nAfter Trump announced in December that he was promoting Mulvaney to the top staff job in his administration, senior White House officials told reporters that he was the president\u2019s \u201coriginal Plan B.\u201d As Trump\u2019s acting White House chief of staff, Mulvaney sits \u2014 however temporarily \u2014 at Washington\u2019s bureaucratic apex, with influence far beyond the C.F.P.B. In the months leading up to the announcement, Mulvaney sometimes brushed off questions about his ambitions by joking that he was busy enough running two agencies. Now, in a sense, he runs them all.",

But some of those feeds were presented atop a gray box that, to some viewer confusion, presented information from the Encyclopaedia Britannica about the 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\u201cThese panels are triggered algorithmically and our systems sometimes make the wrong call,\u201d YouTube said in a statement, adding that it had disabled the boxes on streams related to the fire after recognizing the error.\nThe company did not say why the algorithm paired the live streams with information about the terrorist attacks. A cause for the Notre-Dame fire has not been identified, though investigators are treating it as an accident.\nThe panels, which pull information from Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia, were announced last summer as part of a broader effort to root out misinformation. At the time, YouTube said they would appear \u201calongside videos on a small number of well-established historical and scientific topics that have often been subject to misinformation, like the moon landing and the Oklahoma City Bombing.\u201d\nFor years, YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other tech giants have faced criticism that they have looked the other way as misinformation and hateful speech coursed through their platforms. The companies have taken steps to address the problem, though lawmakers, columnists and others have criticized them for not moving fast enough.\nIn January, YouTube said it would work to stop recommending videos based on conspiracy theories or unfounded claims.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll begin reducing recommendations of borderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways \u2014 such as videos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat, or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11,\u201d it said.\nThis month, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the proliferation of hate speech online, to which it had invited public policy officials from Facebook and Google, YouTube\u2019s parent company.\nThe hearing was streamed live from the committee\u2019s YouTube channel, but the company soon disabled the ability to comment on the feed, citing hateful speech.",

On Tuesday, it spurred donations to do the same for much smaller places of worship thousands of miles away that were recently destroyed by arson.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/church-fires-st-landry-parishmacedonia-ministry\">crowdfunding campaign</a> for three fire-ravaged black churches in Louisiana received more than $1.2 million after it was widely shared on social media on Tuesday. Many users noted that while hundreds of millions of euros had already been pledged to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation.html\">rebuild the famous cathedral</a>, the small churches in Louisiana were still struggling.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These communities need to know that people care about them and what they&rsquo;re going through,&rdquo; Jessica Piombo, a professor who lives in Monterey, Calif., wrote on the campaign&rsquo;s page.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every little bit counts.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The campaign was posted on GoFundMe last Wednesday by the Seventh District Baptist Association, which includes 54 Baptist churches in southwest Louisiana, including the three that were burned. The association noted that donations would go to rebuilding and replacing what was destroyed, from pews to sound systems and musical instruments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/meganromer/status/1118110093785083904\">A screen shot</a> of the campaign&rsquo;s page from early Tuesday morning showed that it had raised $92,939. That number shot upward as the day wore on, including many smaller donations. More than 25,000 people had donated as of early Wednesday afternoon, and a spokesman for GoFundMe said the campaign had received donations from all 50 states.</p>\n<p>Those who shared the campaign on Twitter included Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady; the journalist Yashar Ali; and Jake Tapper, the CNN anchor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/us/louisiana-black-church-fires.html\">The fires occurred</a> on March 26, April 2 and April 4 in St. Landry Parish, north of Lafayette. The first was at St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre; the two others were at Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist in Opelousas, the St. Landry Parish seat. The churches had been the spiritual homes of generations of black families.</p>\n<p><em>[&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t burn down our spirit&rdquo;: Black churches in Louisiana </em><em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/louisiana-black-churches-fires.html?action=click&module=inline&pgtype=Article\">were worried but defiant</a></em><em> after the fires.]</em></p>\n<p>The man accused of setting them, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/us/black-church-fires-louisiana.html\">Holden Matthews</a>, 21, is the son of a deputy sheriff and has been charged with arson and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/louisiana-black-church-fire-hate-crime.html\">hate crimes</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let me say it like this: The only building that had any sign of any furniture remaining was Mount Pleasant,&rdquo; said Freddie Jack, president of the association and the pastor of St. John Baptist Church in Ville Platte, La.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;St. Mary and Greater Union, all you see is charcoal. It&rsquo;s a total, complete loss at all three sites.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>While the churches had insurance, the coverage is limited. Greater Union Baptist Church was also paying down a mortgage taken out for a recent renovation. To complicate matters further, the new churches will have to meet stricter building codes imposed after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Jack said.</p>\n<p>At first, he set a fund-raising goal of $600,000, but on reflection he decided to triple that number to $1.8 million, based on his own experience building his church more than a decade ago.</p>\n<p>Whatever money is raised will be split among the three destroyed churches, each of which has more than 100 regular members, according to Mr. Jack, who met with the pastors of those churches on Monday night.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They have a long road ahead of them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a long way from full recovery, but the generosity of the people seems to be speaking volumes.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "William Widmer for The New York Times\nUpdate: The crowdfunding campaign surpassed its $1.8 million goal late Wednesday, April 17.\nThe fire at Notre-Dame cathedral on Monday prompted immediate pledges of millions of euros to help rebuild it. On Tuesday, it spurred donations to do the same for much smaller places of worship thousands of miles away that were recently destroyed by arson.\nA crowdfunding campaign for three fire-ravaged black churches in Louisiana received more than $1.2 million after it was widely shared on social media on Tuesday. Many users noted that while hundreds of millions of euros had already been pledged to rebuild the famous cathedral, the small churches in Louisiana were still struggling.\n\u201cThese communities need to know that people care about them and what they\u2019re going through,\u201d Jessica Piombo, a professor who lives in Monterey, Calif., wrote on the campaign\u2019s page.\n\u201cEvery little bit counts.\u201d\nThe campaign was posted on GoFundMe last Wednesday by the Seventh District Baptist Association, which includes 54 Baptist churches in southwest Louisiana, including the three that were burned. The association noted that donations would go to rebuilding and replacing what was destroyed, from pews to sound systems and musical instruments.\nA screen shot of the campaign\u2019s page from early Tuesday morning showed that it had raised $92,939. That number shot upward as the day wore on, including many smaller donations. More than 25,000 people had donated as of early Wednesday afternoon, and a spokesman for GoFundMe said the campaign had received donations from all 50 states.\nThose who shared the campaign on Twitter included Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and first lady; the journalist Yashar Ali; and Jake Tapper, the CNN anchor.\nThe fires occurred on March 26, April 2 and April 4 in St. Landry Parish, north of Lafayette. The first was at St. Mary Baptist in Port Barre; the two others were at Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist in Opelousas, the St. Landry Parish seat. The churches had been the spiritual homes of generations of black families.\n[\u201cThey didn\u2019t burn down our spirit\u201d: Black churches in Louisiana were worried but defiant after the fires.]\nThe man accused of setting them, Holden Matthews, 21, is the son of a deputy sheriff and has been charged with arson and hate crimes.\n\u201cLet me say it like this: The only building that had any sign of any furniture remaining was Mount Pleasant,\u201d said Freddie Jack, president of the association and the pastor of St. John Baptist Church in Ville Platte, La.\n\u201cSt. Mary and Greater Union, all you see is charcoal. It\u2019s a total, complete loss at all three sites.\u201d\nWhile the churches had insurance, the coverage is limited. Greater Union Baptist Church was also paying down a mortgage taken out for a recent renovation. To complicate matters further, the new churches will have to meet stricter building codes imposed after Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Jack said.\nAt first, he set a fund-raising goal of $600,000, but on reflection he decided to triple that number to $1.8 million, based on his own experience building his church more than a decade ago.\nWhatever money is raised will be split among the three destroyed churches, each of which has more than 100 regular members, according to Mr. Jack, who met with the pastors of those churches on Monday night.\n\u201cThey have a long road ahead of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re a long way from full recovery, but the generosity of the people seems to be speaking volumes.\u201d",

Will things get better?</strong></p>\n<p>Mr. McTeague said prices were down over the last couple of days. But he cautioned that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s still momentum in the price&rdquo; and that information lags by about a week.</p>\n<p>He predicted the average price per gallon would &ldquo;crest&rdquo; at about $4.15 soon, before dropping back to the $3.80 range.</p>\n<p>But Mr. McTeague noted that big driving weekends &mdash; Easter and Memorial Day &mdash; are coming up.

                "text": "Noah Berger/Associated Press\nGood morning.\n(Here\u2019s the sign-up, if you don\u2019t already get California Today by email.)\nGas is never cheap in California.\nBut if you\u2019ve filled up your tank in recent days, you may have found yourself wincing more than usual.\nThat\u2019s because, for the first time since July 2015, the average price for a gallon of gas in the Golden State pushed past $4, Dan McTeague, a senior petroleum analyst with the site GasBuddy, told me on Monday afternoon.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a psychological benchmark for a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d\nSo what\u2019s causing the price spike?\nYou may already know that the primary reason gas tends to be more expensive in California is the state\u2019s stringent gasoline standards, which require a cleaner fuel blend that only a few refineries outside the state can produce.\nSo when work is stopped at any of the 10 major refineries within California, it can make a significant dent in the supply of gas, which causes prices to rise.\nAnd that, Mr. McTeague said, is exactly what\u2019s been happening.\nAccording to a report by the Oil Price Information Service, six of those 10 major refineries have had work disruptions \u2014 like a fire at a Phillips 66 refinery in Carson on March 15 \u2014 or planned maintenance that has taken them offline.\nMr. McTeague said that those, coupled with a problem at an Air Products hydrogen plant, added up to an abnormal run.\n\u201cYou might have one, you might have two,\u201d he said of unplanned disruptions. \u201cYou don\u2019t have five or six.\u201d\nPlus, he said, the timing is just bad: Refineries are switching to summer gas blend production, which can take facilities temporarily offline.\nWe\u2019re heading toward some big travel weekends. Will things get better?\nMr. McTeague said prices were down over the last couple of days. But he cautioned that \u201cthere\u2019s still momentum in the price\u201d and that information lags by about a week.\nHe predicted the average price per gallon would \u201ccrest\u201d at about $4.15 soon, before dropping back to the $3.80 range.\nBut Mr. McTeague noted that big driving weekends \u2014 Easter and Memorial Day \u2014 are coming up. And drivers may be taking to the roads while supplies are still diminished.\nEither way, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at a volatile summer.\u201d\nPulitzers Recognize California Work\nOn Monday, the winners and finalists for the 2019 Pulitzer Prizes were announced. The awards honor the year\u2019s best journalism, fiction, poetry and music. California was home to many of this year\u2019s honorees. Here\u2019s some of their work:\n\u2022 The Los Angeles Times won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. In an explosive series of stories, the journalists Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle revealed that U.S.C. had allowed a campus gynecologist to continue practicing after he had been repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct by students. The investigation had wide-ranging impacts and roiled the university. [The Los Angeles Times]\n\u2022 The staff of The Chico Enterprise-Record, in collaboration with the Bay Area News Group, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news reporting. The newspaper covered the Camp Fire, the state\u2019s deadliest blaze, on the ground in Paradise, a community that was nearly wiped off the map. [The Enterprise-Record]\n\u2022 And John Locher, Noah Berger and Ringo Chiu, who are Associated Press photojournalists, were named finalists for the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography. They were recognized for their haunting images of the wildfires that tore across the state last year. [The Associated Press]\n\u2022 Darrin Bell, a Los Angeles native, won in editorial cartooning for beautiful and daring editorial cartoons that took on issues affecting disenfranchised communities.[The Pulitzer Prizes]\n\u2022 Ellen Reid\u2019s work of opera-theater, \u201cp r i s m,\u201d won this year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for music. The piece premiered at L.A. Opera\u2019s Off Grand and explores life after trauma. [The Pulitzer Prizes]\nHere\u2019s what else we\u2019re following\n(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers. We appreciate your reading Times stories, but we\u2019d also encourage you to support local news if you can.)\n\u2022 The day after Representative Eric Swalwell announced he was running for president, he insisted that \u201cwe don\u2019t have time for vanity things.\u201d But there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s a long-shot candidate. So why run? There\u2019s not much downside. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 So far in the sprawling college admissions fraud case, students haven\u2019t been prosecuted. But that could change. A lawyer involved in the case said that some of the children of parents who have been charged got so-called target letters, which notify them that they may be the subject of a criminal probe. In another development in the case, Lori Loughlin pleaded not guilty. [The New York Times]\n\u2022 There are 15 men named John in the House of Representatives. And yet, two women named Katie \u2014 Representatives Katie Porter and Katie Hill, both freshmen from Southern California \u2014 are the ones who keep getting confused for each other. \u201cIt\u2019s constant,\u201d Ms. Porter said. [The Los Angeles Times]\n\u2022 How would Palm Springs join Los Angeles and the San Joaquin Valley in having some of the worst air in the nation? \u201cTo paraphrase Bob Dylan, the answer is blowing in the wind.\u201d [The Desert Sun]\n\u2022 Can a universal basic income actually work? Stockton is testing it out \u2014 but even that process is fraught and difficult. Still, if it goes well, the city could become a model. [The Los Angeles Times]\n\u2022 After a disastrous season for the Lakers, Luke Walton took a job as head coach of the Sacramento Kings. Now, the team is hoping his relationship with Vlade Divac, the general manager, will be fruitful. [The Sacramento Bee]\n\u2022 A columnist asks if sideshows, or illegal street shows where drivers burn the rubber off the tires of high-performance cars by doing doughnuts and figure-eights, can go the way of Nascar. Which is to say: Should the East Bay tradition be made legal and hosted in safe, designated venues? [KQED]\nAnd Finally \u2026\nStephen Curry may be supernaturally good at basketball. But he is a normal mortal in at least one regard and that is this: The dude really, really loves popcorn.\nIt\u2019s not a particularly healthy pregame snack, and no one looks cool while they\u2019re eating it \u2014 not even Curry, as the fantastic photos and video in this piece by my colleague Marc Stein attest.\nStill, Curry\u2019s devotion is real and, apparently, widely known enough to inspire staff members at arenas across the nation to prepare for his arrival.\nCurry even went as far as to rank all 29 of their popcorn offerings using a five-category matrix. Which arena came out on top? American Airlines Center, home of the Dallas Mavericks, where the popcorn scored a perfect 5 in freshness, saltiness, butter and presentation. It earned only a 4 in crunchiness, though.\nCalifornia Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes.com. Were you forwarded this email?

                "html": "<p>DENVER &mdash; Hundreds of schools across the Denver area were closed on Wednesday as law enforcement officials engaged in a massive search for a Florida woman who they said had made threats ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting and was considered armed and &ldquo;extremely dangerous.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The decision to keep about half a million students home in two dozen school districts over a vast swath of Colorado showed the sense of alarm among the authorities. An F.B.I. bulletin sent to local law enforcement agencies on Tuesday identified the woman as Sol Pais, 18. She was &ldquo;infatuated&rdquo; with the Columbine attack, the bulletin said, and had been &ldquo;attempting to buy firearms.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Officials also released an image of Ms. Pais, and said she was approximately 5-foot-5, with brown hair. She had recently traveled to Colorado, they said.</p>\n<p>Ms. Pais&rsquo; parents reported her missing to local police on Monday, Detective Sergeant Marian Cruz, a spokeswoman for the Surfside Police Department, said on Wednesday. That has been the only time police have been called to the family&rsquo;s address, she added.</p>\n<p>Daisy Gonzalez-Diego, a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, confirmed on Wednesday that Ms. Pais is a student at Miami Beach Senior High School. The school district is assisting the F.B.I. with its investigation, Ms. Gonzalez-Diego said.</p>\n<p>In a news conference Tuesday night, Dean Phillips, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.&rsquo;s office in Denver, said the search had turned into a &ldquo;massive manhunt.&rdquo; Mr. Phillips said his team had received a tip that morning from federal agents in Miami identifying Ms. Pais as a possible threat in Colorado.</p>\n<p>The F.B.I. then discovered that Ms. Pais had arrived at the Denver airport before buying a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a store. &ldquo;She was then taken to an area where she was last seen out toward the foothills,&rdquo; Mr. Phillips said.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Students leaving Columbine High School late Tuesday.\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16columbine3/16columbine3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16columbine3/16columbine3-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16columbine3/16columbine3-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16columbine3/16columbine3-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 2048w\"></img></figure>\n<p>&ldquo;Her comments, her actions that we have heard about from others tend to cause us great concern that she may pose a threat to a school,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>If authorities find Ms. Pais, it is not clear if they can arrest her. The bulletin sent to local police said they did not have probable cause for arrest, but that officers should detain her &ldquo;and evaluate mental health status.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Florida, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/miami-beach/article229346734.html\">The Miami Herald reported</a> that a man who answered the door at Ms. Pais&rsquo;s address on Tuesday identified himself as her father and said he had lost contact with her on Sunday. &ldquo;I think maybe she&rsquo;s got a mental problem,&rdquo; he told The Herald. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s going to be O.K.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Colorado, the announcement prompted &ldquo;lockouts,&rdquo; or heightened security measures, at schools in Jefferson County and the surrounding area. During a lockout, all exterior doors are locked at a school but business continues as usual inside. Police officers aided in end-of-day student release. County officials said that all students and staff members were safe.</p>\n<p>During the Columbine High School shooting, on April 20, 1999, two students shot and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher.</p>\n<p>The shooting&rsquo;s aftermath was widely televised, and the event became a source of inspiration for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/us/school-shootings-columbine.html\">future attackers</a>. Jefferson County, home to Columbine High School, has spent the past 20 years grappling with that legacy.</p>\n<p>Students, teachers, families and law enforcement officers have had to deal not only with the emotional trauma of the shooting, but also with people who have become obsessed with it, as well as copycats who have carried out their own attacks.</p>\n<p>In an interview last year, the head of safety for Jefferson County schools, John McDonald, said he had often apprehended people who came from around the country to try to enter the school, a major safety concern. These visits &mdash; and interest in the shooting &mdash; have only increased over time, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dealing with this for more than a decade and it&rsquo;s never been more of an issue than it is now, 20 years later.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The approaching anniversary has put many people in the region on edge, and in the last week, the county has implemented lockouts on multiple days.</p>",

                "text": "DENVER \u2014 Hundreds of schools across the Denver area were closed on Wednesday as law enforcement officials engaged in a massive search for a Florida woman who they said had made threats ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting and was considered armed and \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d\nThe decision to keep about half a million students home in two dozen school districts over a vast swath of Colorado showed the sense of alarm among the authorities. An F.B.I. bulletin sent to local law enforcement agencies on Tuesday identified the woman as Sol Pais, 18. She was \u201cinfatuated\u201d with the Columbine attack, the bulletin said, and had been \u201cattempting to buy firearms.\u201d\nOfficials also released an image of Ms. Pais, and said she was approximately 5-foot-5, with brown hair. She had recently traveled to Colorado, they said.\nMs. Pais\u2019 parents reported her missing to local police on Monday, Detective Sergeant Marian Cruz, a spokeswoman for the Surfside Police Department, said on Wednesday. That has been the only time police have been called to the family\u2019s address, she added.\nDaisy Gonzalez-Diego, a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, confirmed on Wednesday that Ms. Pais is a student at Miami Beach Senior High School. The school district is assisting the F.B.I. with its investigation, Ms. Gonzalez-Diego said.\nIn a news conference Tuesday night, Dean Phillips, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I.\u2019s office in Denver, said the search had turned into a \u201cmassive manhunt.\u201d Mr. Phillips said his team had received a tip that morning from federal agents in Miami identifying Ms. Pais as a possible threat in Colorado.\nThe F.B.I. then discovered that Ms. Pais had arrived at the Denver airport before buying a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a store. \u201cShe was then taken to an area where she was last seen out toward the foothills,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.\n\u201cHer comments, her actions that we have heard about from others tend to cause us great concern that she may pose a threat to a school,\u201d he added.\nIf authorities find Ms. Pais, it is not clear if they can arrest her. The bulletin sent to local police said they did not have probable cause for arrest, but that officers should detain her \u201cand evaluate mental health status.\u201d\nIn Florida, The Miami Herald reported that a man who answered the door at Ms. Pais\u2019s address on Tuesday identified himself as her father and said he had lost contact with her on Sunday. \u201cI think maybe she\u2019s got a mental problem,\u201d he told The Herald. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to be O.K.\u201d\nIn Colorado, the announcement prompted \u201clockouts,\u201d or heightened security measures, at schools in Jefferson County and the surrounding area. During a lockout, all exterior doors are locked at a school but business continues as usual inside. Police officers aided in end-of-day student release. County officials said that all students and staff members were safe.\nDuring the Columbine High School shooting, on April 20, 1999, two students shot and killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher.\nThe shooting\u2019s aftermath was widely televised, and the event became a source of inspiration for future attackers. Jefferson County, home to Columbine High School, has spent the past 20 years grappling with that legacy.\nStudents, teachers, families and law enforcement officers have had to deal not only with the emotional trauma of the shooting, but also with people who have become obsessed with it, as well as copycats who have carried out their own attacks.\nIn an interview last year, the head of safety for Jefferson County schools, John McDonald, said he had often apprehended people who came from around the country to try to enter the school, a major safety concern. These visits \u2014 and interest in the shooting \u2014 have only increased over time, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been dealing with this for more than a decade and it\u2019s never been more of an issue than it is now, 20 years later.\u201d\nThe approaching anniversary has put many people in the region on edge, and in the last week, the county has implemented lockouts on multiple days.",

The prosecutors plan to push for the low end of that range.</p>\n<p><em>[Actress Felicity Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced for her role in the </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/felicity-huffman-sentencing.html\"><em>nation&rsquo;s largest college admissions cheating prosecution</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>The prosecutors&rsquo; recommendation for prison time in the case of Ms. Huffman, among the best-known of 33 parents charged in what the Justice Department has said is its largest-ever college admissions prosecution, offers insight into a question that has lingered over the case: Will some of the wealthy and well-connected parents implicated in the scandal end up serving time?</p>\n<p>Ms. Huffman said last week that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/us/felicity-huffman-guilty.html\">she intended to plead guilty</a> to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. In a plea agreement, prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman&rsquo;s crime corresponded to a federal sentencing guideline of four to 10 months in prison and that they would recommend a sentence at the low end of that range, along with a fine of $20,000 and 12 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p>The federal sentencing guidelines are advisory, and judges may impose sentences that are either heavier or lighter than the advised range. The plea agreement also notes that Ms. Huffman &ldquo;reserves the right to argue&rdquo; that her crime actually corresponds to a lower guideline &mdash; of zero to six months of incarceration.</p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/lori-loughlin-update.html\"><em>Read more on the question of prison time in the college admissions case</em></a><em>.</em>]</p>\n<p>According to the charges, Ms. Huffman paid $15,000 to William Singer, a consultant at the center of the case, so that a proctor would correct some of her daughter&rsquo;s answers on the SAT after the girl had finished the test and left. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges. Ms. Huffman&rsquo;s daughter, who was apparently unaware of her mother&rsquo;s plan and to whom Ms. Huffman has publicly apologized, is still in high school.</p>\n<p>Twelve other parents charged in the case have said that they will plead guilty. Prosecutors are arguing for longer sentences than the one proposed for Ms. Huffman in the cases of several of the other parents, because they are accused of paying more money as part of the scheme.</p>\n<p>In the case of Bruce Isackson, who has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and to defraud the United States, prosecutors have said they will recommend a sentence at the low end of a guidelines range of 37 to 46 months. Prosecutors accused Mr. Isackson and his wife, Davina, of paying Mr. Singer a total of $600,000 to facilitate cheating on the ACT for one daughter and to get two daughters admitted to the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California as athletic recruits.</p>\n<p>More than a dozen other parents, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/us/lori-loughlin-mossimo-not-guilty.html\">including the actress Lori Loughlin and her husband</a>, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p>The United States attorney&rsquo;s office in Boston charged 50 people in the case, including college coaches and administrators of the SAT and the ACT.</p>",

The prosecutors plan to push for the low end of that range.\n[Actress Felicity Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced for her role in the nation\u2019s largest college admissions cheating prosecution.]\nThe prosecutors\u2019 recommendation for prison time in the case of Ms. Huffman, among the best-known of 33 parents charged in what the Justice Department has said is its largest-ever college admissions prosecution, offers insight into a question that has lingered over the case: Will some of the wealthy and well-connected parents implicated in the scandal end up serving time?\nMs. Huffman said last week that she intended to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. In a plea agreement, prosecutors said that Ms. Huffman\u2019s crime corresponded to a federal sentencing guideline of four to 10 months in prison and that they would recommend a sentence at the low end of that range, along with a fine of $20,000 and 12 months of supervised release.\nThe federal sentencing guidelines are advisory, and judges may impose sentences that are either heavier or lighter than the advised range. The plea agreement also notes that Ms. Huffman \u201creserves the right to argue\u201d that her crime actually corresponds to a lower guideline \u2014 of zero to six months of incarceration.\n[Read more on the question of prison time in the college admissions case.]\nAccording to the charges, Ms. Huffman paid $15,000 to William Singer, a consultant at the center of the case, so that a proctor would correct some of her daughter\u2019s answers on the SAT after the girl had finished the test and left. Mr. Singer has pleaded guilty to racketeering and other charges. Ms. Huffman\u2019s daughter, who was apparently unaware of her mother\u2019s plan and to whom Ms. Huffman has publicly apologized, is still in high school.\nTwelve other parents charged in the case have said that they will plead guilty. Prosecutors are arguing for longer sentences than the one proposed for Ms. Huffman in the cases of several of the other parents, because they are accused of paying more money as part of the scheme.\nIn the case of Bruce Isackson, who has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and money laundering and to defraud the United States, prosecutors have said they will recommend a sentence at the low end of a guidelines range of 37 to 46 months. Prosecutors accused Mr. Isackson and his wife, Davina, of paying Mr. Singer a total of $600,000 to facilitate cheating on the ACT for one daughter and to get two daughters admitted to the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California as athletic recruits.\nMore than a dozen other parents, including the actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, the designer Mossimo Giannulli, have pleaded not guilty.\nThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Boston charged 50 people in the case, including college coaches and administrators of the SAT and the ACT.",

                "html": "<p>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has paid $8 million to a teenager who was sexually abused and later kidnapped by a teacher at her Catholic high school in 2016, her lawyer said Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The case has drawn attention to the problem of sex abuse at Catholic institutions that is committed by church employees who are not clergy members.</p>\n<p>Dave Ring, a lawyer for the victim, and advocates for abuse survivors said the settlement was believed to be the largest amount paid to a single victim by the archdiocese, which has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to abuse survivors in recent years.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I think the archdiocese has tended to settle cases for larger amounts when priests are involved,&rdquo; Mr. Ring said on Tuesday. &ldquo;In this particular case, the fact that it is a lay person and a coach and an athletic director, I think they are starting to realize that even lay people who may not hold a super important position in the church can still wreak havoc on a young person&rsquo;s life, just as much as a priest can.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Adrian M. Alarcon, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, declined Tuesday to confirm the price of the settlement. But she said that a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/us/16cnd-abuse.html?mtrref=www.google.com\">$660 million settlement reached in 2007</a> with 508 abuse victims included sizable awards to &ldquo;certain individuals,&rdquo; although the church did not decide how that money was distributed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Archdiocese recognizes that there was serious harm done to the life of the victim-survivor,&rdquo; the archdiocese said in a statement. &ldquo;We hope that the settlement will allow her to heal and move forward with her education and lifetime goals. The Archdiocese apologizes for the impact that this caused in her life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The victim has not been publicly identified. She was 15 years old when she was sexually abused by Ivan Barajas, the athletic director and health teacher at San Gabriel Mission High School in San Gabriel, Calif., a parish school owned and operated by the archdiocese, according to court documents in a lawsuit filed in 2017. He was also her volleyball coach.</p>\n<p>After kidnapping the girl and being captured by the police in Nevada, Mr. Barajas, 39, pleaded guilty to felony unlawful sex with a minor. He is serving a three-year sentence at Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada and will then serve a second three-year sentence in California.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barajas began sexually abusing the girl in his office on school grounds in April 2016, Mr. Ring said. He also sexually abused her in the library, the faculty lounge and the gym, according to court documents. The victim is now 18 years old.</p>\n<figure>Image<img alt=\"Ivan Barajas\" sizes=\"50vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 821w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1642w\"></img><figcaption>Ivan BarajasCredit...Henderson Detention Center, via Associated Press</figcaption></figure>\n<p>According to court documents, in the months before Mr. Barajas began abusing the student, several people &mdash; including parents and faculty members &mdash; expressed their concern about him to school and archdiocese officials. But those officials declined to take meaningful action.</p>\n<p>During the 2014-15 school year, a volleyball coach told administrators he was concerned about Mr. Barajas&rsquo;s interactions with female students.</p>\n<p>More people complained about Mr. Barajas during the 2015-16 school year, including a parent and a second volleyball coach who eventually shared his concerns with Msgr. Sal Pilato, the superintendent of high schools for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>Mr. Ring said another parent sent school officials an anonymous letter expressing their concern about Mr. Barajas. The Los Angeles Times <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-archdiocese-sex-abuse-settlement-20190416-story.html\">reported on Tuesday</a> that one letter, sent to Monsignor Pilato, said, &ldquo;He takes the ones he likes to the office.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Every act of abuse took place on campus in a really small school when the guy was already under suspicion and they already had complaints about him,&rdquo; Mr. Ring said. &ldquo;The archdiocese says it has all these policies and procedures and training in place from the priest abuse scandal. Well, where was it in this case?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The school did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday night.</p>\n<p>During the course of the monthslong abuse, Mr. Barajas sent the teenage girl sexually charged text messages and pictures on his cellphone, which he used to record video of himself abusing her, according to court documents.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Ivan Barajas\" sizes=\"50vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 821w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/16/us/16xp-lachurch/merlin_153604380_8d413184-ee6f-474f-94b1-51de723b74df-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp 1642w\"></img></figure>\n<p>He kidnapped the girl after his wife discovered evidence of the abuse on his cellphone and confronted him about it in July 2016. He fled California and took the student to Nevada, where they spent five days sleeping in his car and hiding in secluded parks in and around Las Vegas.</p>\n<p>They were found early one morning in Mr. Barajas&rsquo;s car by police officers conducting a routine check of a parking lot in Henderson, Nev. Mr. Barajas was taken into custody and later convicted of sex crimes in Nevada and California.</p>\n<p>The student returned home, where she received several months of inpatient therapy, Mr. Ring said.</p>\n<p>Esther Miller, an abuse survivor who received part of the 2007 settlement from the archdiocese, said that for many Catholics, especially children at Catholic schools, the power wielded by a clergy member or an influential lay person could carry similar weight.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is a spotlight that needs to be shown on the situation of lay abusers because there is a lot of darkness there,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re in the church pew, in the sacristy or on the blacktop on the playground, it is the same vibe,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s the principal, the athletic director or the janitor, it is the same thing. Whatever power a child can have is stolen from them.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has paid $8 million to a teenager who was sexually abused and later kidnapped by a teacher at her Catholic high school in 2016, her lawyer said Tuesday.\nThe case has drawn attention to the problem of sex abuse at Catholic institutions that is committed by church employees who are not clergy members.\nDave Ring, a lawyer for the victim, and advocates for abuse survivors said the settlement was believed to be the largest amount paid to a single victim by the archdiocese, which has paid hundreds of millions of dollars to abuse survivors in recent years.\n\u201cI think the archdiocese has tended to settle cases for larger amounts when priests are involved,\u201d Mr. Ring said on Tuesday. \u201cIn this particular case, the fact that it is a lay person and a coach and an athletic director, I think they are starting to realize that even lay people who may not hold a super important position in the church can still wreak havoc on a young person\u2019s life, just as much as a priest can.\u201d\nAdrian M. Alarcon, a spokeswoman for the archdiocese, declined Tuesday to confirm the price of the settlement. But she said that a $660 million settlement reached in 2007 with 508 abuse victims included sizable awards to \u201ccertain individuals,\u201d although the church did not decide how that money was distributed.\n\u201cThe Archdiocese recognizes that there was serious harm done to the life of the victim-survivor,\u201d the archdiocese said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that the settlement will allow her to heal and move forward with her education and lifetime goals. The Archdiocese apologizes for the impact that this caused in her life.\u201d\nThe victim has not been publicly identified. She was 15 years old when she was sexually abused by Ivan Barajas, the athletic director and health teacher at San Gabriel Mission High School in San Gabriel, Calif., a parish school owned and operated by the archdiocese, according to court documents in a lawsuit filed in 2017. He was also her volleyball coach.\nAfter kidnapping the girl and being captured by the police in Nevada, Mr. Barajas, 39, pleaded guilty to felony unlawful sex with a minor. He is serving a three-year sentence at Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada and will then serve a second three-year sentence in California.\nMr. Barajas began sexually abusing the girl in his office on school grounds in April 2016, Mr. Ring said. He also sexually abused her in the library, the faculty lounge and the gym, according to court documents. The victim is now 18 years old.\nImage\nAccording to court documents, in the months before Mr. Barajas began abusing the student, several people \u2014 including parents and faculty members \u2014 expressed their concern about him to school and archdiocese officials. But those officials declined to take meaningful action.\nDuring the 2014-15 school year, a volleyball coach told administrators he was concerned about Mr. Barajas\u2019s interactions with female students.\nMore people complained about Mr. Barajas during the 2015-16 school year, including a parent and a second volleyball coach who eventually shared his concerns with Msgr. Sal Pilato, the superintendent of high schools for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\nMr. Ring said another parent sent school officials an anonymous letter expressing their concern about Mr. Barajas. The Los Angeles Times reported on Tuesday that one letter, sent to Monsignor Pilato, said, \u201cHe takes the ones he likes to the office.\u201d\n\u201cEvery act of abuse took place on campus in a really small school when the guy was already under suspicion and they already had complaints about him,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cThe archdiocese says it has all these policies and procedures and training in place from the priest abuse scandal. Well, where was it in this case?\u201d\nThe school did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday night.\nDuring the course of the monthslong abuse, Mr. Barajas sent the teenage girl sexually charged text messages and pictures on his cellphone, which he used to record video of himself abusing her, according to court documents.\nHe kidnapped the girl after his wife discovered evidence of the abuse on his cellphone and confronted him about it in July 2016. He fled California and took the student to Nevada, where they spent five days sleeping in his car and hiding in secluded parks in and around Las Vegas.\nThey were found early one morning in Mr. Barajas\u2019s car by police officers conducting a routine check of a parking lot in Henderson, Nev. Mr. Barajas was taken into custody and later convicted of sex crimes in Nevada and California.\nThe student returned home, where she received several months of inpatient therapy, Mr. Ring said.\nEsther Miller, an abuse survivor who received part of the 2007 settlement from the archdiocese, said that for many Catholics, especially children at Catholic schools, the power wielded by a clergy member or an influential lay person could carry similar weight.\n\u201cThere is a spotlight that needs to be shown on the situation of lay abusers because there is a lot of darkness there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re in the church pew, in the sacristy or on the blacktop on the playground, it is the same vibe,\u201d she added. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the principal, the athletic director or the janitor, it is the same thing. Whatever power a child can have is stolen from them.\u201d",

Barr was an effort to deliver on President Trump&rsquo;s promise to end the &ldquo;catch and release&rdquo; of migrants crossing the border in hopes of escaping persecution in their home countries.</p>\n<p>The order &mdash; which directs immigration judges to deny some migrants a chance to post bail &mdash; will not go into effect for 90 days. It is all but certain to be challenged in federal court, but immigrant rights lawyers said it could undermine the basic rights of people seeking safety in the United States.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They want to send a message that you will get detained,&rdquo; said Judy Rabinovitz, a deputy director of the Immigrants Rights&rsquo; Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. &ldquo;We are talking about people who are fleeing for their lives, seeking safety. And our response is just lock them up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s order is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are able to seek protection from violence, poverty and gangs by asking for legal status in the United States. It has slowed the processing of asylum requests at ports of entry, and it has ordered that some asylum seekers be required to wait in Mexico.</p>\n<p>At a recent campaign rally, Mr. Trump said that some asylum claims were a &ldquo;big fat con job&rdquo; and that migrants were met at the border by lawyers eager to press those claims. In warning of the coming crackdown, the president said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing games.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a &ldquo;credible fear&rdquo; of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later.</p>\n<p>A federal judge in Washington State this month affirmed the rights of individuals with a bona fide claim for asylum, saying they must be given the opportunity to seek bail within seven days of a request.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Barr&rsquo;s order came in a case involving an Indian man who crossed into the United States from Mexico and claimed asylum. Mr. Barr, exercising his authority as the top official overseeing the immigration courts, said that migrants in similar cases do not have the right to bail.</p>\n<p>Such an immigrant, &ldquo;after establishing a credible fear of persecution or torture, is ineligible for release on bond,&rdquo; Mr. Barr wrote in his order, which overrules a previous Board of Immigration Appeals case from 2005.</p>\n<p>A migrant seeking asylum could still ask the Department of Homeland Security to be released under a grant of parole, but that is entirely at the discretion of the department, which under Mr. Trump has sharply cut back on such releases.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s decision does not affect migrants applying for asylum at one of the two dozen ports of entry along the border with Mexico. It affects people who are apprehended after they cross into the United States illegally in the often vast, rural stretches of the border.</p>\n<p>Officials say the goal of the hard-line approach is to deter migrants from entering the United States. But the administration&rsquo;s policies &mdash; some of which have been blocked in the courts &mdash; have failed to stem the tide of arrivals.</p>\n<p>A surge of migrants from Central America, many of whom are families traveling with small children, has overwhelmed the Border Patrol and other authorities in communities along the southwestern border. Facilities for detaining illegal immigrants are well beyond capacity, forcing the authorities to release some of them soon after they are apprehended.</p>\n<p>In the border city of Yuma, Ariz., <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/yuma-migrants-emergency-border.html\">Mayor Douglas Nicholls declared an emergency</a> on Tuesday over what he said was the &ldquo;imminent threat&rdquo; posed by &ldquo;too many migrant releases into our community.&rdquo; Mr. Nicholls said that he was seeking help from state and federal authorities.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s decision could add to the overcrowding crisis in the immigrant detention centers by requiring judges to keep asylum seekers in jail for longer periods. In his 11-page order, Mr. Barr appeared to concede the reality of the problem.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I will delay the effective date of this decision for 90 days so that D.H.S. may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions,&rdquo; Mr. Barr wrote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s decision does not affect unaccompanied children or families who cross into the United States illegally. A longstanding settlement in a previous court case says that the government cannot detain children or families for longer than 20 days.</p>\n<p>But immigrant rights lawyers said that Mr. Barr&rsquo;s order &mdash; if it goes into effect &mdash; could set a precedent that the government could use to deny bond hearings, and bail, for an even broader number of immigrants.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Trump&rsquo;s mantra is: End catch and release,&rdquo; Ms. Rabinovitz said. &ldquo;What does that mean? It&rsquo;s human beings. We&rsquo;re not talking about a game of cat and mouse.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Rabinovitz and other immigration lawyers said they intended to quickly challenge Mr. Barr&rsquo;s order in federal court, perhaps as soon as Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department declined to comment beyond the text of Mr. Barr&rsquo;s decision.</p>\n<p>Because immigration courts are housed under the Justice Department, not the judicial branch, the attorney general has the authority to refer cases to himself and overturn decisions. Last October, less than a month before he was pushed out of the administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked to review the case, known as the &ldquo;Matter of M- S-,&rdquo; to determine whether immigrants with credible asylum claims should be able to post bond and enter the United States.</p>\n<p>Only months before, Mr. Sessions had overturned another immigration appeals court ruling and made it harder for victims of domestic abuse or gang violence to seek asylum.</p>\n<p>The decision by Mr. Barr is an indication that cracking down on immigration remains a top priority despite the departure of Mr. Sessions, who had been a fierce advocate for tougher immigration laws for more than two decades.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr, who was confirmed in February, decided that under the law, immigrants with pending asylum claims must be detained &mdash; a decision that overturned an immigration appeals decision in a case called the &ldquo;Matter of X- K-.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday took another significant step to discourage migrants from seeking asylum, issuing an order that could keep thousands of them in jail indefinitely while they wait for a resolution of their asylum requests.\nThe order issued by Attorney General William P. Barr was an effort to deliver on President Trump\u2019s promise to end the \u201ccatch and release\u201d of migrants crossing the border in hopes of escaping persecution in their home countries.\nThe order \u2014 which directs immigration judges to deny some migrants a chance to post bail \u2014 will not go into effect for 90 days. It is all but certain to be challenged in federal court, but immigrant rights lawyers said it could undermine the basic rights of people seeking safety in the United States.\n\u201cThey want to send a message that you will get detained,\u201d said Judy Rabinovitz, a deputy director of the Immigrants Rights\u2019 Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cWe are talking about people who are fleeing for their lives, seeking safety. And our response is just lock them up.\u201d\nMr. Barr\u2019s order is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are able to seek protection from violence, poverty and gangs by asking for legal status in the United States. It has slowed the processing of asylum requests at ports of entry, and it has ordered that some asylum seekers be required to wait in Mexico.\nAt a recent campaign rally, Mr. Trump said that some asylum claims were a \u201cbig fat con job\u201d and that migrants were met at the border by lawyers eager to press those claims. In warning of the coming crackdown, the president said, \u201cI\u2019m not playing games.\u201d\nFor more than a decade, migrants who are deemed to have a \u201ccredible fear\u201d of persecution in their home countries have been allowed to request a bond hearing so they can be released on bail while they wait for their asylum cases to be heard, sometimes months or years later.\nA federal judge in Washington State this month affirmed the rights of individuals with a bona fide claim for asylum, saying they must be given the opportunity to seek bail within seven days of a request.\nBut Mr. Barr\u2019s order came in a case involving an Indian man who crossed into the United States from Mexico and claimed asylum. Mr. Barr, exercising his authority as the top official overseeing the immigration courts, said that migrants in similar cases do not have the right to bail.\nSuch an immigrant, \u201cafter establishing a credible fear of persecution or torture, is ineligible for release on bond,\u201d Mr. Barr wrote in his order, which overrules a previous Board of Immigration Appeals case from 2005.\nA migrant seeking asylum could still ask the Department of Homeland Security to be released under a grant of parole, but that is entirely at the discretion of the department, which under Mr. Trump has sharply cut back on such releases.\nMr. Barr\u2019s decision does not affect migrants applying for asylum at one of the two dozen ports of entry along the border with Mexico. It affects people who are apprehended after they cross into the United States illegally in the often vast, rural stretches of the border.\nOfficials say the goal of the hard-line approach is to deter migrants from entering the United States. But the administration\u2019s policies \u2014 some of which have been blocked in the courts \u2014 have failed to stem the tide of arrivals.\nA surge of migrants from Central America, many of whom are families traveling with small children, has overwhelmed the Border Patrol and other authorities in communities along the southwestern border. Facilities for detaining illegal immigrants are well beyond capacity, forcing the authorities to release some of them soon after they are apprehended.\nIn the border city of Yuma, Ariz., Mayor Douglas Nicholls declared an emergency on Tuesday over what he said was the \u201cimminent threat\u201d posed by \u201ctoo many migrant releases into our community.\u201d Mr. Nicholls said that he was seeking help from state and federal authorities.\nMr. Barr\u2019s decision could add to the overcrowding crisis in the immigrant detention centers by requiring judges to keep asylum seekers in jail for longer periods. In his 11-page order, Mr. Barr appeared to concede the reality of the problem.\n\u201cI will delay the effective date of this decision for 90 days so that D.H.S. may conduct the necessary operational planning for additional detention and parole decisions,\u201d Mr. Barr wrote.\nMr. Barr\u2019s decision does not affect unaccompanied children or families who cross into the United States illegally. A longstanding settlement in a previous court case says that the government cannot detain children or families for longer than 20 days.\nBut immigrant rights lawyers said that Mr. Barr\u2019s order \u2014 if it goes into effect \u2014 could set a precedent that the government could use to deny bond hearings, and bail, for an even broader number of immigrants.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Trump\u2019s mantra is: End catch and release,\u201d Ms. Rabinovitz said. \u201cWhat does that mean? It\u2019s human beings. We\u2019re not talking about a game of cat and mouse.\u201d\nMs. Rabinovitz and other immigration lawyers said they intended to quickly challenge Mr. Barr\u2019s order in federal court, perhaps as soon as Wednesday.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment beyond the text of Mr. Barr\u2019s decision.\nBecause immigration courts are housed under the Justice Department, not the judicial branch, the attorney general has the authority to refer cases to himself and overturn decisions. Last October, less than a month before he was pushed out of the administration, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked to review the case, known as the \u201cMatter of M- S-,\u201d to determine whether immigrants with credible asylum claims should be able to post bond and enter the United States.\nOnly months before, Mr. Sessions had overturned another immigration appeals court ruling and made it harder for victims of domestic abuse or gang violence to seek asylum.\nThe decision by Mr. Barr is an indication that cracking down on immigration remains a top priority despite the departure of Mr. Sessions, who had been a fierce advocate for tougher immigration laws for more than two decades.\nMr. Barr, who was confirmed in February, decided that under the law, immigrants with pending asylum claims must be detained \u2014 a decision that overturned an immigration appeals decision in a case called the \u201cMatter of X- K-.\u201d",

Biden Jr. on Tuesday remembered Ernest F. Hollings as &ldquo;a giant in this state and nation&rdquo; who evolved to &ldquo;write the great story of our times.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Speaking at the funeral of Mr. Hollings, the former South Carolina senator who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/obituaries/ernest-hollings-dead.html?searchResultPosition=1\">died this month at 97</a>, Mr. Biden hailed his longtime friend and former colleague, a one-time segregationist, as the embodiment of this state&rsquo;s growth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People can change,&rdquo; Mr. Biden said of Mr. Hollings, who was known as Fritz, adding, &ldquo;We can learn from the past and build a better future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden&rsquo;s trip here marked his first visit to an early nominating state this year and came just a week before he is expected to make his long-anticipated entry into the Democratic presidential primary.</p>\n<p>His somber appearance at The Citadel, South Carolina&rsquo;s military college and Mr. Hollings&rsquo;s alma mater, was not the 2020 debut the former vice president and his aides were planning. But his eulogy underscored Mr. Biden&rsquo;s deep ties to this pivotal state with its high percentage of black voters &mdash; and the promise and peril of his candidacy.</p>\n<p>[<em>Make sense of the people, issues and ideas </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\"><em>shaping American politics with our newsletter.</em></a>]</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden once described Mr. Hollings as his best friend in the Senate. And as he recalled in strikingly subdued tones Tuesday, it was Mr. Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, who helped persuade him to remain in the Senate when his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident shortly after he was first elected in 1972.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Aside from my family, the first people to bring me back from that black hole I was in were Fritz and Peatsy, that&rsquo;s not hyperbole,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>That friendship is what first brought Mr. Biden to South Carolina, where Mr. Hollings would introduce him to many of his political allies. Eventually, Mr. Biden began vacationing in the state, usually staying on one of the barrier islands near Mr. Hollings&rsquo;s native Charleston. The relationships Mr. Biden developed here now form the nucleus of his support network in the first-in-the-South primary state.</p>\n<p>Those connections were on vivid display as the former vice president stood before hundreds of mourners in the cadet chapel. It was an audience that included scores of influential state and local Democratic officials such as Representative James Clyburn, a fellow eulogist and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress.</p>\n<p>The funeral reflected the era of the man his admirers had come to honor, with gray hair filling the pews and sepia-toned memories flowing from the pulpit, recalling a lawmaker who was first elected to office in the aftermath of World War II and retired from the Senate 15 years ago.</p>\n<p>Such older Americans here and beyond make up the core of Mr. Biden&rsquo;s initial base, early polls indicate, and are the sort of reliable participants in primaries that candidates covet. The former Charleston mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., for example, attended the service and said in a brief interview that he intended to support Mr. Biden.</p>\n<p>But as the former vice president extolled an earlier, less rancorous political time in his tribute to Mr. Hollings, the challenges he will face in this coming campaign were also difficult to miss.</p>\n<p>Younger Democrats have little personal connection to Mr. Hollings and those who are aware of him recall that he began his career, like many other white politicians of his generation in the South, as a segregationist.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden, who is himself facing intense questions about his 1970s opposition to school busing, handled Mr. Hollings&rsquo;s evolution on race delicately in his speech, referring only obliquely to the senator&rsquo;s earlier support for segregation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He was constantly evolving,&rdquo; said Mr. Biden, standing before a Citadel choir that was made up equally of black and white members.</p>\n<p>With his penchant for poetry and blarney, the former vice president has emerged as a sort of national eulogist in chief. And Mr. Hollings was not the first South Carolina political icon Mr. Biden has honored: In 2003, he delivered a eulogy for Strom Thurmond, a longtime Republican senator and onetime Dixiecrat nominee for president.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Biden, who was closer personally to Mr. Hollings, used that speech to talk much more extensively how about how Mr. Thurmond &ldquo;moved to the good side.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, it fell to Mr. Clyburn to speak in more detail about how Mr. Hollings went from defending &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; as a young state legislator to, as governor, telling state lawmakers that &ldquo;we have run out of courts&rdquo; and supporting the integration of Clemson University.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thank God a man can grow,&rdquo; said Mr. Clyburn, his voice breaking. &ldquo;Fritz grew and I grew along with him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Neither he nor Mr. Biden mentioned the fact that the Confederate flag was raised atop South Carolina&rsquo;s Capitol dome by a state legislator in 1961 when Mr. Hollings was governor. The flag would<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/us/confederate-flag-south-carolina.html?searchResultPosition=6\"> remain on the Statehouse grounds until 2015</a>, when it was removed in the aftermath of the racist killing of black parishioners at Charleston&rsquo;s Mother Emanuel church.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He put the Confederate flag on the Statehouse that we had to fight to take down,&rdquo; said Melissa Watson, a Charleston-area teacher and local Democratic official who is black. Ms. Watson praised Mr. Hollings as &ldquo;a statesman&rdquo; but said he changed his views on race because &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t have a choice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Hollings was elected to the Senate in 1966, a year after the Voting Rights Act secured the franchise for African-Americans in the South, and would rely on black votes throughout his career in a state that would eventually become a Republican bulwark.</p>\n<p>A World War II veteran with a sharp mind and sharper tongue, Mr. Hollings quickly made his mark in the Senate, taking over the chamber&rsquo;s campaign committee in 1972.</p>\n<p>That is when he agreed to support a 29-year-old local Delaware official to challenge a long-serving Republican senator in that state. &ldquo;He ended up taking a chance on me,&rdquo; Mr. Biden recalled, revealing that he still keeps a picture on the wall of his parents with Mr. Hollings that year.</p>\n<p>A decade after he retired, a federal courthouse in Charleston was named for Mr. Hollings. But, as Mr. Biden noted, he rejected the honor and asked that it be named instead for J. Waties Waring, a local federal judge and lonely voice for integration in the civil rights era.</p>\n<p>Mr. Biden, who according to advisers did not schedule any other events while he was here, was not the only former senator in attendance: former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and former Senator Christopher J. Dodd both came to pay their respects.</p>\n<p>Mr. Kerry acknowledged that he had given some consideration to making a 2020 presidential bid of his own, but he said, &ldquo;I want to see what Joe is going to do.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Mic Smith/Associated Press\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday remembered Ernest F. Hollings as \u201ca giant in this state and nation\u201d who evolved to \u201cwrite the great story of our times.\u201d\nSpeaking at the funeral of Mr. Hollings, the former South Carolina senator who died this month at 97, Mr. Biden hailed his longtime friend and former colleague, a one-time segregationist, as the embodiment of this state\u2019s growth.\n\u201cPeople can change,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Hollings, who was known as Fritz, adding, \u201cWe can learn from the past and build a better future.\u201d\nMr. Biden\u2019s trip here marked his first visit to an early nominating state this year and came just a week before he is expected to make his long-anticipated entry into the Democratic presidential primary.\nHis somber appearance at The Citadel, South Carolina\u2019s military college and Mr. Hollings\u2019s alma mater, was not the 2020 debut the former vice president and his aides were planning. But his eulogy underscored Mr. Biden\u2019s deep ties to this pivotal state with its high percentage of black voters \u2014 and the promise and peril of his candidacy.\n[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]\nMr. Biden once described Mr. Hollings as his best friend in the Senate. And as he recalled in strikingly subdued tones Tuesday, it was Mr. Hollings and his wife, Peatsy, who helped persuade him to remain in the Senate when his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident shortly after he was first elected in 1972.\n\u201cAside from my family, the first people to bring me back from that black hole I was in were Fritz and Peatsy, that\u2019s not hyperbole,\u201d he said.\nThat friendship is what first brought Mr. Biden to South Carolina, where Mr. Hollings would introduce him to many of his political allies. Eventually, Mr. Biden began vacationing in the state, usually staying on one of the barrier islands near Mr. Hollings\u2019s native Charleston. The relationships Mr. Biden developed here now form the nucleus of his support network in the first-in-the-South primary state.\nThose connections were on vivid display as the former vice president stood before hundreds of mourners in the cadet chapel. It was an audience that included scores of influential state and local Democratic officials such as Representative James Clyburn, a fellow eulogist and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress.\nThe funeral reflected the era of the man his admirers had come to honor, with gray hair filling the pews and sepia-toned memories flowing from the pulpit, recalling a lawmaker who was first elected to office in the aftermath of World War II and retired from the Senate 15 years ago.\nSuch older Americans here and beyond make up the core of Mr. Biden\u2019s initial base, early polls indicate, and are the sort of reliable participants in primaries that candidates covet. The former Charleston mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., for example, attended the service and said in a brief interview that he intended to support Mr. Biden.\nBut as the former vice president extolled an earlier, less rancorous political time in his tribute to Mr. Hollings, the challenges he will face in this coming campaign were also difficult to miss.\nYounger Democrats have little personal connection to Mr. Hollings and those who are aware of him recall that he began his career, like many other white politicians of his generation in the South, as a segregationist.\nMr. Biden, who is himself facing intense questions about his 1970s opposition to school busing, handled Mr. Hollings\u2019s evolution on race delicately in his speech, referring only obliquely to the senator\u2019s earlier support for segregation.\n\u201cHe was constantly evolving,\u201d said Mr. Biden, standing before a Citadel choir that was made up equally of black and white members.\nWith his penchant for poetry and blarney, the former vice president has emerged as a sort of national eulogist in chief. And Mr. Hollings was not the first South Carolina political icon Mr. Biden has honored: In 2003, he delivered a eulogy for Strom Thurmond, a longtime Republican senator and onetime Dixiecrat nominee for president.\nBut Mr. Biden, who was closer personally to Mr. Hollings, used that speech to talk much more extensively how about how Mr. Thurmond \u201cmoved to the good side.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, it fell to Mr. Clyburn to speak in more detail about how Mr. Hollings went from defending \u201cseparate but equal\u201d as a young state legislator to, as governor, telling state lawmakers that \u201cwe have run out of courts\u201d and supporting the integration of Clemson University.\n\u201cThank God a man can grow,\u201d said Mr. Clyburn, his voice breaking. \u201cFritz grew and I grew along with him.\u201d\nNeither he nor Mr. Biden mentioned the fact that the Confederate flag was raised atop South Carolina\u2019s Capitol dome by a state legislator in 1961 when Mr. Hollings was governor. The flag would remain on the Statehouse grounds until 2015, when it was removed in the aftermath of the racist killing of black parishioners at Charleston\u2019s Mother Emanuel church.\n\u201cHe put the Confederate flag on the Statehouse that we had to fight to take down,\u201d said Melissa Watson, a Charleston-area teacher and local Democratic official who is black. Ms. Watson praised Mr. Hollings as \u201ca statesman\u201d but said he changed his views on race because \u201che didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\nMr. Hollings was elected to the Senate in 1966, a year after the Voting Rights Act secured the franchise for African-Americans in the South, and would rely on black votes throughout his career in a state that would eventually become a Republican bulwark.\nA World War II veteran with a sharp mind and sharper tongue, Mr. Hollings quickly made his mark in the Senate, taking over the chamber\u2019s campaign committee in 1972.\nThat is when he agreed to support a 29-year-old local Delaware official to challenge a long-serving Republican senator in that state. \u201cHe ended up taking a chance on me,\u201d Mr. Biden recalled, revealing that he still keeps a picture on the wall of his parents with Mr. Hollings that year.\nA decade after he retired, a federal courthouse in Charleston was named for Mr. Hollings. But, as Mr. Biden noted, he rejected the honor and asked that it be named instead for J. Waties Waring, a local federal judge and lonely voice for integration in the civil rights era.\nMr. Biden, who according to advisers did not schedule any other events while he was here, was not the only former senator in attendance: former Secretary of State John F. Kerry and former Senator Christopher J. Dodd both came to pay their respects.\nMr. Kerry acknowledged that he had given some consideration to making a 2020 presidential bid of his own, but he said, \u201cI want to see what Joe is going to do.\u201d",

A spokesman for Tennessee&rsquo;s House Republican Caucus said the Senate could consider its version of the bill within a matter of days.</p>\n<p>The governor, Bill Lee, is a first-term Republican who was elected in November; he was noncommittal when asked about the legislation Monday, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/9b14b93ffbbf4ede98bcddcc5c559f94\">according to The Associated Press</a>. A spokeswoman for Mr. Lee did not return a request for comment.</p>\n<p>But the bill&rsquo;s opponents, including Mr. Clemmons, say they expect it to be signed into law. It could then face legal challenges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re prepared to keep fighting,&rdquo; said Charlane Oliver, a co-founder of the Equity Alliance, a Tennessee-based nonprofit that advocates for African-Americans to get involved in the civic process.</p>\n<p>The Tennessee proposal is just the latest of a flurry of measures across the country that have made it harder to vote. Since 2010, 25 states &mdash; from Arizona to New Hampshire &mdash; have imposed strict photo identification requirements, cut back on early voting periods or imposed other restrictions, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/new-voting-restrictions-america\">according to The Brennan Center for Justice,</a> a nonpartisan law and policy institute based in New York.</p>\n<p>In 2018 alone, at least a half-dozen states enacted new restrictions, the center said.</p>\n<p>Myrna P&eacute;rez, who leads the Brennan Center&rsquo;s Voting Rights and Elections Project, said that states have sometimes taken steps to regulate community groups and nonprofit organizations that are seeking to register voters.</p>\n<p>But she said she found the Tennessee legislation concerning because it would impose so many rules at once, and because there appeared to be no allegation that those driving the registration efforts had been anything other than sloppy.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I am entirely sympathetic to the claims that are being made that this is an attempt to stifle and chill voter registration drives, and it may have the impact of doing so,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>The bill would apply to people or organizations who conduct registration drives, seek to collect 100 or more voter registration forms and pay individuals to collect the forms. Officials say it would not apply to individuals or organizations who collect forms using only unpaid volunteers.</p>\n<p>It would impose civil penalties on those who file 100 or more &ldquo;deficient&rdquo; voter registration applications, starting at $150 in each county where a violation occurred. Under the bill, any person or group that filed more than 500 faulty applications could be fined up to $10,000.</p>\n<p>In addition, it would make it a Class A misdemeanor to establish a minimum number of registration forms for workers to collect.</p>\n<p>Ms. Oliver said the bill was an attempt to place the burden of processing applications on community groups rather than on the government.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally wrong to penalize people for doing one of the most democratic acts in this nation &mdash; registering voters,&rdquo; she said.</p>",

                "text": "Mark Humphrey/Associated Press\nTennessee lawmakers passed a bill through the state House on Monday that would fine community groups that submit incomplete voter-registration applications, an unusual move that the bill\u2019s opponents have denounced as voter suppression.\nProtesters swarmed the State Capitol to speak out against the Republican-backed bill, which has drawn condemnation from voting rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers, who say it would discriminate against minority voters in a state where overall turnout is already abysmal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly intended to have a chilling effect on voting efforts across Tennessee,\u201d John Ray Clemmons, a Democratic state representative, said of the bill.\nTens of thousands of new black and Latino voters were registered in Tennessee in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, but thousands of applications in Shelby County were disqualified by state election officials for what critics say were frivolous reasons. Republicans have cited the dispute as rationale for passing the legislation.\n\u201cWe want every eligible Tennessean to vote, and voter registration must be done responsibly and in a manner that does not compromise the security or integrity of elections,\u201d said Tre Hargett, the Republican secretary of state, on Tuesday.\n[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]\nRepublicans maintain a supermajority in both the state House and Senate. A spokesman for Tennessee\u2019s House Republican Caucus said the Senate could consider its version of the bill within a matter of days.\nThe governor, Bill Lee, is a first-term Republican who was elected in November; he was noncommittal when asked about the legislation Monday, according to The Associated Press. A spokeswoman for Mr. Lee did not return a request for comment.\nBut the bill\u2019s opponents, including Mr. Clemmons, say they expect it to be signed into law. It could then face legal challenges.\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to keep fighting,\u201d said Charlane Oliver, a co-founder of the Equity Alliance, a Tennessee-based nonprofit that advocates for African-Americans to get involved in the civic process.\nThe Tennessee proposal is just the latest of a flurry of measures across the country that have made it harder to vote. Since 2010, 25 states \u2014 from Arizona to New Hampshire \u2014 have imposed strict photo identification requirements, cut back on early voting periods or imposed other restrictions, according to The Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute based in New York.\nIn 2018 alone, at least a half-dozen states enacted new restrictions, the center said.\nMyrna P\u00e9rez, who leads the Brennan Center\u2019s Voting Rights and Elections Project, said that states have sometimes taken steps to regulate community groups and nonprofit organizations that are seeking to register voters.\nBut she said she found the Tennessee legislation concerning because it would impose so many rules at once, and because there appeared to be no allegation that those driving the registration efforts had been anything other than sloppy.\n\u201cI am entirely sympathetic to the claims that are being made that this is an attempt to stifle and chill voter registration drives, and it may have the impact of doing so,\u201d she said.\nThe bill would apply to people or organizations who conduct registration drives, seek to collect 100 or more voter registration forms and pay individuals to collect the forms. Officials say it would not apply to individuals or organizations who collect forms using only unpaid volunteers.\nIt would impose civil penalties on those who file 100 or more \u201cdeficient\u201d voter registration applications, starting at $150 in each county where a violation occurred. Under the bill, any person or group that filed more than 500 faulty applications could be fined up to $10,000.\nIn addition, it would make it a Class A misdemeanor to establish a minimum number of registration forms for workers to collect.\nMs. Oliver said the bill was an attempt to place the burden of processing applications on community groups rather than on the government.\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally wrong to penalize people for doing one of the most democratic acts in this nation \u2014 registering voters,\u201d she said.",

By doing so, Mr. Trump hopes to raise the pressure on Cuba, but risks another rupture with American allies in Europe and Canada that scrambled in vain in recent days to head off the change.</p>\n<p>The action will be announced by the State Department on Wednesday and discussed by the president&rsquo;s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, in a speech in Miami marking the 58th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs operation that failed to topple the Castro government during the early days of John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s administration. Mr. Trump is trying to force Havana to back off its support for Venezuela&rsquo;s leader, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, whom administration officials said Cuba had propped up with more than 20,000 troops.</p>\n<p>In his decision to lift the limits, Mr. Trump brushed aside vigorous protests by European leaders who brought their objections to Washington in recent weeks. Spain&rsquo;s foreign minister met with Mr. Bolton, and other European officials pressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, arguing that such a move would harm their businesses as well as the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We strongly condemn&rdquo; the move, Alberto Navarro, the European Union ambassador to Havana, was quoted telling reporters. &ldquo;This will create even more confusion for foreign investments that are helping create jobs and prosperity in Cuba.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The European Union threatened last week to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization if it proceeded, and suggested that counterclaims could be filed in European courts against American firms that took advantage of the new policy. &ldquo;The E.U. will be obliged to use all means at its disposal,&rdquo; the union&rsquo;s foreign policy chief and trade commissioner wrote in a letter to Mr. Pompeo.</p>\n<p>The policy change stems from the Helms-Burton Act passed by Congress in 1996 to target Cuba, but Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all approved suspensions of the litigation provisions every six months since on the grounds that it could cause international upheaval and clog up American courts.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump suspended the provisions as well until this year, when Mr. Pompeo declared in January that the administration would approve a waiver for only 45 days instead of the traditional six months, a move later extended by another 30 days and finally another two weeks to the beginning of May.</p>\n<p>Mr. Pompeo opened the door to the change last month by announcing that the administration would lift the litigation limits specifically for about 200 companies or entities controlled by Cuba&rsquo;s military, intelligence or security services that are already under sanctions by the United States.</p>\n<p>In addition to now authorizing lawsuits against a wider array of possible targets, the administration will also invoke another provision of Helms-Burton that allows the government to deny or withdraw visas from those tied to trafficking property confiscated from American citizens.</p>\n<p>The senior administration official previewed the moves for reporters on the condition of anonymity in advance of the official announcement on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The decision to finally impose the Helms-Burton provisions after 23 years reflects the larger reversal of United States policy since Mr. Obama restored diplomatic relations and reopened the American Embassy in Havana. Mr. Obama argued that six decades of embargo and isolation had failed and it was time to try a new approach.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump, however, came into office criticizing his predecessor for na&iuml;vet&eacute; toward Cuba and has unraveled some of the Obama administration&rsquo;s policies encouraging more interaction with Havana, although he has not broken off diplomatic relations again nor closed the embassy.</p>\n<p>Cuba on Tuesday denounced the latest move. &ldquo;Before they climb euphoric at the crest of their dirty water wave, with evil purposes &amp; lies, here is a touch of reality,&rdquo; Johana Tablada, a Cuban Foreign Ministry official, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohanaTablada/status/1118202897173553152\">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Referring to United Nations votes urging an end to the Helms-Burton economic sanctions, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JohanaTablada/status/1118202897173553152\">she added</a>: &ldquo;What the #World truly asked #JohnBolton &amp; #UnitedStates gov., very recently, in #NewYork was to remove its criminal #Blockade &amp; #HelmsBurton against #Cuba.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s decision was a victory for Florida Republicans, who quickly hailed the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Allowing American citizens to sue for stolen property in Cuba and denying foreign nationals involved in trafficking stolen property entry into the United States is a huge step toward cutting off the money supply to the Castro regime,&rdquo; Senator Rick Scott <a href=\"https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/ahead-bay-pigs-anniversary-sen-rick-scott-urges-president-trump-fully-implement-libertad-act\">said in a statement</a>.</p>\n<p>Senator Marco Rubio agreed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1118217123640299520\">on Twitter</a>: &ldquo;Allowing U.S. citizens to sue regime for confiscated property in #Cuba is the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Yamil Lage/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has approved a move intended to further choke off foreign investment in Cuba by lifting longstanding limits on American citizens seeking to sue over property confiscated by the Havana government going back to Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution six decades ago, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.\nThe decision, a sharp departure from the policy of the last three presidents, could open the floodgates to thousands of lawsuits against foreign companies and individuals accused of \u201ctrafficking\u201d in seized property. By doing so, Mr. Trump hopes to raise the pressure on Cuba, but risks another rupture with American allies in Europe and Canada that scrambled in vain in recent days to head off the change.\nThe action will be announced by the State Department on Wednesday and discussed by the president\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, in a speech in Miami marking the 58th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs operation that failed to topple the Castro government during the early days of John F. Kennedy\u2019s administration. Mr. Trump is trying to force Havana to back off its support for Venezuela\u2019s leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom administration officials said Cuba had propped up with more than 20,000 troops.\nIn his decision to lift the limits, Mr. Trump brushed aside vigorous protests by European leaders who brought their objections to Washington in recent weeks. Spain\u2019s foreign minister met with Mr. Bolton, and other European officials pressed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, arguing that such a move would harm their businesses as well as the Cuban people.\n\u201cWe strongly condemn\u201d the move, Alberto Navarro, the European Union ambassador to Havana, was quoted telling reporters. \u201cThis will create even more confusion for foreign investments that are helping create jobs and prosperity in Cuba.\u201d\nThe European Union threatened last week to sue the United States at the World Trade Organization if it proceeded, and suggested that counterclaims could be filed in European courts against American firms that took advantage of the new policy. \u201cThe E.U. will be obliged to use all means at its disposal,\u201d the union\u2019s foreign policy chief and trade commissioner wrote in a letter to Mr. Pompeo.\nThe policy change stems from the Helms-Burton Act passed by Congress in 1996 to target Cuba, but Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all approved suspensions of the litigation provisions every six months since on the grounds that it could cause international upheaval and clog up American courts.\nMr. Trump suspended the provisions as well until this year, when Mr. Pompeo declared in January that the administration would approve a waiver for only 45 days instead of the traditional six months, a move later extended by another 30 days and finally another two weeks to the beginning of May.\nMr. Pompeo opened the door to the change last month by announcing that the administration would lift the litigation limits specifically for about 200 companies or entities controlled by Cuba\u2019s military, intelligence or security services that are already under sanctions by the United States.\nIn addition to now authorizing lawsuits against a wider array of possible targets, the administration will also invoke another provision of Helms-Burton that allows the government to deny or withdraw visas from those tied to trafficking property confiscated from American citizens.\nThe senior administration official previewed the moves for reporters on the condition of anonymity in advance of the official announcement on Wednesday.\nThe decision to finally impose the Helms-Burton provisions after 23 years reflects the larger reversal of United States policy since Mr. Obama restored diplomatic relations and reopened the American Embassy in Havana. Mr. Obama argued that six decades of embargo and isolation had failed and it was time to try a new approach.\nMr. Trump, however, came into office criticizing his predecessor for na\u00efvet\u00e9 toward Cuba and has unraveled some of the Obama administration\u2019s policies encouraging more interaction with Havana, although he has not broken off diplomatic relations again nor closed the embassy.\nCuba on Tuesday denounced the latest move. \u201cBefore they climb euphoric at the crest of their dirty water wave, with evil purposes & lies, here is a touch of reality,\u201d Johana Tablada, a Cuban Foreign Ministry official, wrote on Twitter.\nReferring to United Nations votes urging an end to the Helms-Burton economic sanctions, she added: \u201cWhat the #World truly asked #JohnBolton & #UnitedStates gov., very recently, in #NewYork was to remove its criminal #Blockade & #HelmsBurton against #Cuba.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision was a victory for Florida Republicans, who quickly hailed the president.\n\u201cAllowing American citizens to sue for stolen property in Cuba and denying foreign nationals involved in trafficking stolen property entry into the United States is a huge step toward cutting off the money supply to the Castro regime,\u201d Senator Rick Scott said in a statement.\nSenator Marco Rubio agreed on Twitter: \u201cAllowing U.S. citizens to sue regime for confiscated property in #Cuba is the right thing to do.\u201d",

(&ldquo;Thanks for watching!&rdquo; Ms. Pelosi responded.)</p>\n<p>Cher, the singer and frequent Trump critic who uses a toilet emoji when referring to the president, disliked the White House&rsquo;s proposed plan to transport undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities, saying Los Angeles already had people in poverty it could not take care of. &ldquo;I finally agree with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cher\">@Cher</a>!&rdquo; Mr. Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1117813230678814722\">exclaimed</a> to 59 million Twitter followers.</p>\n<p>In addition to his running commentary, Mr. Trump has taken up the role of play-by-play announcer. He first weighed in on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation.html\">the fire that engulfed Notre-Dame</a>, the French cathedral and international symbol of resilience and faith, by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1117844987293487104\">suggesting that flying tankers</a> drop water on the 800-year-old structure. The French authorities responded with a pointed English-language statement to say that the building, already buckling under the weight of crumbling wooden beams and limestone, would have been destroyed if that advice had been followed.</p>\n<p>This did not deter the president from sharing updates with a crowd of supporters in Minnesota with all the accuracy of a police scanner: &ldquo;Looks like it&rsquo;s burning to the ground,&rdquo; Mr. Trump told his supporters. They gasped at the news. (Notre-Dame, it turned out, did not burn to the ground, but by the time the smoke cleared, Mr. Trump had already moved on to disparaging Robert S. Mueller III&rsquo;s investigation.)</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump has always enjoyed providing his own unique interpretation of the day&rsquo;s news, in part because for years before coming to Washington he saw himself as a part of the media, first as a tabloid fixture in New York City and then as a cable commentator and reality-television star.</p>\n<p>Randal Pinkett, the chairman of BCT Partners, a consulting firm, and winner of season four of &ldquo;The Apprentice,&rdquo; recalled in an interview that Mr. Trump was &ldquo;obsessed with media&rdquo; and constantly reminded people around him that the show was No. 1 (though <a href=\"http://tviv.org/Nielsen_Ratings/Historic/Network_Television_by_Season/2000s#2005.E2.80.932006_Season\">it did not crack the top 20</a>).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He has the same temperament now that he did,&rdquo; Mr. Pinkett said, &ldquo;and has probably had for quite some time, given the Donald-centric world he&rsquo;s constructed around himself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Now in the White House, Mr. Trump&rsquo;s delight in being the first to share information is palpable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you enjoy being the first person to scoop someone?&rdquo; said Anthony Scaramucci, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/us/politics/the-days-of-the-mooch.html\">served for 11 days</a> as the White House communications director.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;For many years he felt that there was no separation between his brand and the media, that there was an intersection of value for himself personally between his brand and saturating it in the media,&rdquo; Mr. Scaramucci said.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump spent decades sharpening his ability to manipulate and create his own news cycles, sometimes in pioneering ways. Years before running for president, Mr. Trump frequently used the six-second social media video platform Vine to weigh in on topics such as Miley Cyrus and the former Democratic congressman Anthony D. Weiner &mdash; &ldquo;No perverts!&rdquo; Mr. Trump exclaimed one day from his private jet.</p>\n<p>As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump was often described by aides as a sophisticated version of a parrot, given his penchant for repeating information almost unfiltered, as soon as he had processed it.</p>\n<p>As president, Mr. Trump &mdash; who has shaped the White House communications operation around his belief that he is his own best messenger &mdash; has acted as both reporter and participant. When Tiger Woods <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/sports/tiger-woods-wins-masters.html\">clinched the Masters golf tournament</a> on Sunday, Mr. Trump, who spent the day inviting Americans to watch &mdash; &ldquo;Very exciting, tune in!&rdquo; &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/sports/golf/tiger-woods-medal-of-freedom.html\">announced he would award Mr. Woods</a> the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because of his incredible Success &amp; Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!&rdquo; Mr. Trump wrote.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s allies and advisers see his use of information flow, particularly on Twitter, as one of his strengths. He presents himself to supporters not just as an elected official representing them, but also as a source they can believe.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Part of the reason that the president was elected in the first place was because he reflected the distrust and disdain that large swaths of the country have had for the mainstream media for many years now,&rdquo; said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and a former special assistant to the president in the White House.</p>\n<p>Boris Epshteyn, now the chief political commentator at Sinclair Broadcast Group who also served as a special assistant to Mr. Trump, said the president had &ldquo;consistently been very effective&rdquo; at dealing with the media during his career, and that as president, he had &ldquo;the most powerful loudspeaker in the world, both through traditional and social media channels.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For all of the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump&rsquo;s uses of his unscheduled hours, some aides privately concede that a large portion of that time is spent with a television on in the background. When he eats lunch in his dining room with visitors, a TV is usually on, either turned down or muted, until there is something he wants to hear. When he travels on Air Force One, he toggles between the Golf Channel and Fox News. The morning hours blocked off for unstructured executive time are often interspersed with tweets responding to television commentary on Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s report.</p>\n<p>To reinforce Mr. Trump&rsquo;s view that he has been &ldquo;exonerated&rdquo; by the investigation, White House surrogates who appear on cable news in support of the president have received a barrage of emails, many written by Julia Hahn, the White House surrogate liaison, declaring the president fully vindicated.</p>\n<p>Democrats have made a point of rejecting the notion that the president should be placing himself at the front and center of every major cultural development. &ldquo;Starting today, we are going to change the channel,&rdquo; Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said in a speech <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-announcement.html\">announcing his presidential candidacy</a> on Sunday, adding that it was time to end Mr. Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;horror show&rdquo; in Washington.</p>\n<p>Mo Elleithee, the executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Mr. Trump&rsquo;s insistence on inserting himself into a wide variety of stories &mdash; some of which are about his potential 2020 opponents and not the White House &mdash; may be the president&rsquo;s way of trying to wrestle back attention from a crowded field.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If anything, he&rsquo;s going to be responding&rdquo; to non-Trump-related news going forward, Mr. Elleithee said, &ldquo;which is an unusual place for him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But, he added: &ldquo;The fact that he was giving firefighting advice as the flames were still blazing just shows one, that his instinct right now is to try to get into every story he possibly can, and two, it&rsquo;s not as effective as it once was. A year ago, it would&rsquo;ve been dominant.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Sarah Silbiger/The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As he awaits the Thursday release of the redacted special counsel report on his 2016 campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, President Trump is filling his idle moments \u2014 and blowing off any anticipatory steam \u2014 by turning to a familiar pastime: television.\nIn speeches, in interviews and on Twitter this week, the president has returned to his comfortable role of town crier and news wire as he opines on the news developments of the day.\nBernie Sanders, a prospective Democratic challenger for the presidency, appeared on Fox News: Weird, the president tweeted on Tuesday, adding that it was odd that \u201cwe\u201d \u2014 meaning he and Fox News \u2014 had brought the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile into the channel\u2019s Trump-friendly fold of cable contributors.\nNancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, appeared on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d over the weekend: \u201cPuff piece,\u201d the president scoffed on Twitter, adding that Ms. Pelosi was a \u201cdisaster\u201d in negotiations with him at the White House. (\u201cThanks for watching!\u201d Ms. Pelosi responded.)\nCher, the singer and frequent Trump critic who uses a toilet emoji when referring to the president, disliked the White House\u2019s proposed plan to transport undocumented migrants to sanctuary cities, saying Los Angeles already had people in poverty it could not take care of. \u201cI finally agree with @Cher!\u201d Mr. Trump exclaimed to 59 million Twitter followers.\nIn addition to his running commentary, Mr. Trump has taken up the role of play-by-play announcer. He first weighed in on the fire that engulfed Notre-Dame, the French cathedral and international symbol of resilience and faith, by suggesting that flying tankers drop water on the 800-year-old structure. The French authorities responded with a pointed English-language statement to say that the building, already buckling under the weight of crumbling wooden beams and limestone, would have been destroyed if that advice had been followed.\nThis did not deter the president from sharing updates with a crowd of supporters in Minnesota with all the accuracy of a police scanner: \u201cLooks like it\u2019s burning to the ground,\u201d Mr. Trump told his supporters. They gasped at the news. (Notre-Dame, it turned out, did not burn to the ground, but by the time the smoke cleared, Mr. Trump had already moved on to disparaging Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation.)\nMr. Trump has always enjoyed providing his own unique interpretation of the day\u2019s news, in part because for years before coming to Washington he saw himself as a part of the media, first as a tabloid fixture in New York City and then as a cable commentator and reality-television star.\nRandal Pinkett, the chairman of BCT Partners, a consulting firm, and winner of season four of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d recalled in an interview that Mr. Trump was \u201cobsessed with media\u201d and constantly reminded people around him that the show was No. 1 (though it did not crack the top 20).\n\u201cHe has the same temperament now that he did,\u201d Mr. Pinkett said, \u201cand has probably had for quite some time, given the Donald-centric world he\u2019s constructed around himself.\u201d\nNow in the White House, Mr. Trump\u2019s delight in being the first to share information is palpable.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you enjoy being the first person to scoop someone?\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, who served for 11 days as the White House communications director.\n\u201cFor many years he felt that there was no separation between his brand and the media, that there was an intersection of value for himself personally between his brand and saturating it in the media,\u201d Mr. Scaramucci said.\nMr. Trump spent decades sharpening his ability to manipulate and create his own news cycles, sometimes in pioneering ways. Years before running for president, Mr. Trump frequently used the six-second social media video platform Vine to weigh in on topics such as Miley Cyrus and the former Democratic congressman Anthony D. Weiner \u2014 \u201cNo perverts!\u201d Mr. Trump exclaimed one day from his private jet.\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump was often described by aides as a sophisticated version of a parrot, given his penchant for repeating information almost unfiltered, as soon as he had processed it.\nAs president, Mr. Trump \u2014 who has shaped the White House communications operation around his belief that he is his own best messenger \u2014 has acted as both reporter and participant. When Tiger Woods clinched the Masters golf tournament on Sunday, Mr. Trump, who spent the day inviting Americans to watch \u2014 \u201cVery exciting, tune in!\u201d \u2014 announced he would award Mr. Woods the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\u201cBecause of his incredible Success & Comeback in Sports (Golf) and, more importantly, LIFE, I will be presenting him with the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.\nMr. Trump\u2019s allies and advisers see his use of information flow, particularly on Twitter, as one of his strengths. He presents himself to supporters not just as an elected official representing them, but also as a source they can believe.\n\u201cPart of the reason that the president was elected in the first place was because he reflected the distrust and disdain that large swaths of the country have had for the mainstream media for many years now,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and a former special assistant to the president in the White House.\nBoris Epshteyn, now the chief political commentator at Sinclair Broadcast Group who also served as a special assistant to Mr. Trump, said the president had \u201cconsistently been very effective\u201d at dealing with the media during his career, and that as president, he had \u201cthe most powerful loudspeaker in the world, both through traditional and social media channels.\u201d\nFor all of the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump\u2019s uses of his unscheduled hours, some aides privately concede that a large portion of that time is spent with a television on in the background. When he eats lunch in his dining room with visitors, a TV is usually on, either turned down or muted, until there is something he wants to hear. When he travels on Air Force One, he toggles between the Golf Channel and Fox News. The morning hours blocked off for unstructured executive time are often interspersed with tweets responding to television commentary on Mr. Mueller\u2019s report.\nTo reinforce Mr. Trump\u2019s view that he has been \u201cexonerated\u201d by the investigation, White House surrogates who appear on cable news in support of the president have received a barrage of emails, many written by Julia Hahn, the White House surrogate liaison, declaring the president fully vindicated.\nDemocrats have made a point of rejecting the notion that the president should be placing himself at the front and center of every major cultural development. \u201cStarting today, we are going to change the channel,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said in a speech announcing his presidential candidacy on Sunday, adding that it was time to end Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201chorror show\u201d in Washington.\nMo Elleithee, the executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on inserting himself into a wide variety of stories \u2014 some of which are about his potential 2020 opponents and not the White House \u2014 may be the president\u2019s way of trying to wrestle back attention from a crowded field.\n\u201cIf anything, he\u2019s going to be responding\u201d to non-Trump-related news going forward, Mr. Elleithee said, \u201cwhich is an unusual place for him.\u201d\nBut, he added: \u201cThe fact that he was giving firefighting advice as the flames were still blazing just shows one, that his instinct right now is to try to get into every story he possibly can, and two, it\u2019s not as effective as it once was. A year ago, it would\u2019ve been dominant.\u201d",

He promoted a video tying a Muslim congresswoman to images of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.</p>\n<p>The message seems clear and so does the audience: more red meat for red-state Americans who have been the foundation of his political enterprise since his against-the-odds campaign for the White House. And it is a reminder that this president governs as none of his modern predecessors did.</p>\n<p>The old-fashioned idea that a president, once reaching office, should at least pretend to be the leader of all the people these days seems so, well, old-fashioned. Mr. Trump does not bother with the pretense. He is speaking to his people, not the people. He has become, or so it often seems, the president of the United Base of America.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump travels nearly five times as often to states that were in his column in 2016 as to those that supported Hillary Clinton. He has given nearly four times as many interviews to Fox News as to all the other major networks combined. His social media advertising is aimed disproportionately at older Americans who were the superstructure of his victory in the Electoral College in 2016. His messaging is permeated with divisive language that galvanizes core supporters more than it persuades anyone on the fence, much less on the other side.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just from a pure governance standpoint, the ability to be president of a majority of the country, they don&rsquo;t even seem to consider that&rsquo;s part of being president,&rdquo; said Matthew Dowd, who was President George W. Bush&rsquo;s re-election strategist and has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to earn the support of a majority of Americans even for a single day of his term. His <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx\">approval rating in Gallup</a> has stayed within a 10-point band of 35 percent to 45 percent throughout his presidency.</p>\n<p>To some extent, that may reflect a time of polarization. Mr. Bush spent his entire second term under 50 percent approval, and President Barack Obama spent nearly three years of his second term with less than a majority.</p>\n<p>But Mr. Trump seems to relish divide-and-conquer politics much more than either of them did and has made little effort to expand his coalition beyond the voters who propelled him to the White House in the first place. While other presidents sought to broaden their public support, Mr. Trump appears to be heading into his re-election campaign sticking with his own tribe.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Donald Trump has never adopted that presidential rhetoric,&rdquo; said Nicole Hemmer, a University of Virginia professor who studies the conservative movement. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always continued with the campaign rhetoric.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s advisers, however, insist that is not the case, that while he is an unconventional politician with a howitzer Twitter account and an itchy trigger finger, he is still trying to reach out to new voters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The idea that we&rsquo;re strictly preaching to the converted is not true,&rdquo; said Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump&rsquo;s re-election campaign.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We look at the 2016 map and we intend to win where the president won the last time and we also think that we can expand the map and attract new voters and new supporters in states across the country,&rdquo; Mr. Murtaugh said. &ldquo;There are two main differences this time between 2016 and 2020 &mdash; the first being that he&rsquo;s now the incumbent president and the second is that he has a clear record of accomplishment that he can run on.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Murtaugh cited the strong economy that has produced millions of jobs and increased wages as well as legislation like the overhaul of the criminal justice system. He also said voters across ideological lines agree with Mr. Trump&rsquo;s argument on immigration that the law should be enforced.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Democrats make a mistake where they can just shout the word immigration and think they win the argument with Hispanic voters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have found that legal immigrants, those who have followed the law to be Americans or those who have legal immigrants in recent generations close to themselves, believe that others should also follow the law.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Trump&rsquo;s path to victory in 2016 was an inside straight, winning the Electoral College even though he lost the national popular vote to Mrs. Clinton by nearly three million votes. Notwithstanding Mr. Trump&rsquo;s advisers, Democrats and independent analysts said the president seemed to be gambling that he could win the same way again.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They are doubling down on lightning striking the same place twice and the idea that this 46 percent president can once again through divide and conquer tactics win again,&rdquo; said Cornell Belcher, a pollster who worked for Mr. Obama. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to play the hand they are given and he doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of other hands.

                "text": "Jessica Lutz for The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In the last couple of weeks, President Trump repeatedly called his enemies \u201ctreasonous.\u201d He threatened to punish Democrats by dumping migrants in their districts. He promoted a video tying a Muslim congresswoman to images of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.\nThe message seems clear and so does the audience: more red meat for red-state Americans who have been the foundation of his political enterprise since his against-the-odds campaign for the White House. And it is a reminder that this president governs as none of his modern predecessors did.\nThe old-fashioned idea that a president, once reaching office, should at least pretend to be the leader of all the people these days seems so, well, old-fashioned. Mr. Trump does not bother with the pretense. He is speaking to his people, not the people. He has become, or so it often seems, the president of the United Base of America.\nMr. Trump travels nearly five times as often to states that were in his column in 2016 as to those that supported Hillary Clinton. He has given nearly four times as many interviews to Fox News as to all the other major networks combined. His social media advertising is aimed disproportionately at older Americans who were the superstructure of his victory in the Electoral College in 2016. His messaging is permeated with divisive language that galvanizes core supporters more than it persuades anyone on the fence, much less on the other side.\n\u201cJust from a pure governance standpoint, the ability to be president of a majority of the country, they don\u2019t even seem to consider that\u2019s part of being president,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, who was President George W. Bush\u2019s re-election strategist and has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to earn the support of a majority of Americans even for a single day of his term. His approval rating in Gallup has stayed within a 10-point band of 35 percent to 45 percent throughout his presidency.\nTo some extent, that may reflect a time of polarization. Mr. Bush spent his entire second term under 50 percent approval, and President Barack Obama spent nearly three years of his second term with less than a majority.\nBut Mr. Trump seems to relish divide-and-conquer politics much more than either of them did and has made little effort to expand his coalition beyond the voters who propelled him to the White House in the first place. While other presidents sought to broaden their public support, Mr. Trump appears to be heading into his re-election campaign sticking with his own tribe.\n\u201cDonald Trump has never adopted that presidential rhetoric,\u201d said Nicole Hemmer, a University of Virginia professor who studies the conservative movement. \u201cHe\u2019s always continued with the campaign rhetoric.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s advisers, however, insist that is not the case, that while he is an unconventional politician with a howitzer Twitter account and an itchy trigger finger, he is still trying to reach out to new voters.\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re strictly preaching to the converted is not true,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\u201cWe look at the 2016 map and we intend to win where the president won the last time and we also think that we can expand the map and attract new voters and new supporters in states across the country,\u201d Mr. Murtaugh said. \u201cThere are two main differences this time between 2016 and 2020 \u2014 the first being that he\u2019s now the incumbent president and the second is that he has a clear record of accomplishment that he can run on.\u201d\nMr. Murtaugh cited the strong economy that has produced millions of jobs and increased wages as well as legislation like the overhaul of the criminal justice system. He also said voters across ideological lines agree with Mr. Trump\u2019s argument on immigration that the law should be enforced.\n\u201cDemocrats make a mistake where they can just shout the word immigration and think they win the argument with Hispanic voters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have found that legal immigrants, those who have followed the law to be Americans or those who have legal immigrants in recent generations close to themselves, believe that others should also follow the law.\u201d\nMr. Trump\u2019s path to victory in 2016 was an inside straight, winning the Electoral College even though he lost the national popular vote to Mrs. Clinton by nearly three million votes. Notwithstanding Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Democrats and independent analysts said the president seemed to be gambling that he could win the same way again.\n\u201cThey are doubling down on lightning striking the same place twice and the idea that this 46 percent president can once again through divide and conquer tactics win again,\u201d said Cornell Belcher, a pollster who worked for Mr. Obama. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to play the hand they are given and he doesn\u2019t have a lot of other hands. He\u2019s got to double down on this tribalism that got him there in the first place and hope they can do enough that Democrats cannot cobble together the majority that\u2019s sitting out there and rejecting Trump.\u201d\nIndeed, Mr. Trump has spent much of his presidency focused on the parts of the country that already support him. Not counting four states where he regularly stays at his own properties or Maryland, where he travels to Joint Base Andrews or Camp David, he has spent nearly five times as many days in states that voted for him as those that did not, 115 versus 25, according to Bill Frischling of Factba.se, a service that compiles and analyzes data on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\nAt the same time, since becoming president, Mr. Trump has given 49 interviews to Fox News, reaching his most fervent supporters, compared with just 13 for the other major networks combined, according to numbers kept by Mark Knoller, the longtime CBS News correspondent. And Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign is spending 44 percent of its Facebook advertising budget targeting users 65 and older, far more proportionately than the Democrats, Axios reported.\nOther Democrats said it was not clear whether Mr. Trump\u2019s recent spate of divisive language reflected calculation. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Mr. Trump might be lashing out more simply because he had fewer advisers around him to restrain him. At the same time, she said Mr. Trump is building a campaign that is far more extensive than the ad hoc organization he had last time.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s any strategy so much as him being liberated,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to me, even though he\u2019s wily and clever, like someone who\u2019s thinking deeply about strategy for 2020. But it may not matter. My view is they\u2019re building a whole apparatus outside the White House that\u2019s gearing up for 2020.\u201d\nOther presidents have had to find a balance between being the leader of a nation and a partisan candidate for election, swinging from messages of unity to tough attacks on opponents. But the old theory about reaching out to swing voters to build a governing coalition, much less a re-election coalition, has been fading for years.\nBill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist in 1992 and 1996 to reach beyond the Democratic base and Mr. Bush in 2000 called himself a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d to appeal to voters in the middle.\nAfter he prevailed following the divisive Florida recount, Mr. Bush sought to reach out by working with Democrats on education and other issues. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he visited a mosque and made a point of stressing that the war that followed was not a war against Muslims. He likewise sought to expand his appeal to Hispanics by supporting an overhaul of immigration laws.\nBut after 2000, Mr. Dowd conducted a study for Mr. Bush concluding that most independents were really reliable Democratic or Republican voters and that the fraction of the electorate genuinely open to persuasion had shrunk since 1980 from 22 percent to 7 percent.\nThat led to a strategy in 2004 that emphasized maximizing Mr. Bush\u2019s base, notably by supporting a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. But Mr. Dowd, who personally disagreed with that specific initiative, said they still tried to win over new voters. \u201cWe never thought we were choosing between one and the other,\u201d he said.\nThe Trump team, by contrast, seemed to have \u201cset a high-water mark of 46 percent,\u201d banking on the idea that the president could lose the popular vote again but still hang onto the Electoral College. \u201cThey could do both but they seem to have decided they don\u2019t care to do both,\u201d Mr. Dowd said. \u201cThe only thing they want to do is motivate his base.\u201d\nMr. Murtaugh said the president was actually expanding the president\u2019s base. If he is not necessarily winning over opponents, he is bringing new voters into the process. A survey found that one-quarter of the people who turned out for a recent Trump rally in El Paso had voted only in one of the past four elections and another quarter had not voted in any of them, according to Mr. Murtaugh.\n\u201cThese are new voters,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might call them low-propensity voters; they don\u2019t vote year in and year out. President Trump is not a typical politician by any means so a lot of these states that we talk about, they are not necessarily Republican states, they are Trump states.\u201d",

The material is expected to be distributed in the coming days.</p>\n<p>Despite the enormity of the population&rsquo;s need, the delivery of humanitarian aid has become a political battle between the president, Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, and Venezuela&rsquo;s opposition.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the president of the Red Cross in Venezuela said the aid should not become embroiled in a political dispute, and asked for the cooperation of politicians.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It will be distributed in conformance with the fundamental principles of our movement, especially neutrality, impartiality and independence,&rdquo; Mario Villarroel, president of the Venezuelan Red Cross, said of the supplies. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow the politicization of this great achievement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The agency estimates its Venezuelan campaign could become its biggest relief effort since the beginning of civil war in Syria.</p>\n<p><em>[The </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/middleeast/us-china-india-venezuela-iran-oil.html\"><em>United States&rsquo; efforts to tighten oil sanctions against Venezuela and Iran</em></a> <em>risks unsettling global oil markets.]</em></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/04/10/world/americas/10reuters-venezuela-politics-un.html\">recent United Nations report</a> found about a quarter of the country&rsquo;s population is in dire need of food and basic supplies &mdash; and the need is expected to grow.

Mr. Guaid&oacute;, a leader of the opposition and of congress, invoked an article of Venezuela&rsquo;s Constitution in late January and claimed the country&rsquo;s leadership after pointing out widespread irregularities in the elections that gave Mr. Maduro a second term.</p>\n<p>In February, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/world/americas/venezuela-aid-border-maduro.html\">an ambitious plan</a> by the opposition, led by Mr. Guaid&oacute;, to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela from neighboring countries degenerated into bloody skirmishes as the trucks ran into blockades set up by security forces loyal to Mr. Maduro.</p>\n<p>Mr. Guaid&oacute; had hoped the plan would at once bring some relief to Venezuelans, strengthen his credibility as the country&rsquo;s new leader, and convince troops to turn against Mr. Maduro rather than use force to keep food and medication beyond the reach of a needy population.</p>\n<p>Although some military officials did cross the lines to join Mr. Guaid&oacute;, it was a trickle, not the sea change the opposition had envisioned. The blockade largely succeeded, with little aid entering the country.</p>\n<p><em>[On </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-coup-guaido-military.html\"><em>April 30, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid&oacute; called for a military uprising</em></a><em>.]</em></p>\n<p>Since then, the crisis has been compounded by the impact of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/world/americas/venezuela-sanctions-maduro.html\">American sanctions</a> on Venezuela&rsquo;s oil industry. The measures are aimed at weakening Mr. Maduro and forcing him to cede power to Mr. Guaid&oacute;, who has the support of the United States and about 50 other countries, but the pain they inflict is felt first by the population.</p>\n<p>Mr. Maduro&rsquo;s decision to accept the Red Cross aid has hobbled this parallel effort to deliver supplies that was mounted by the opposition. Still, it was celebrated by Mr. Maduro&rsquo;s opponents as a victory brought about by their persistence.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Today, the first shipment of humanitarian aid arrived for our people,&rdquo; Henrique Capriles, a leading figure of the opposition, posted on Twitter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reality thanks to the pressure of Venezuelans and the support of our interim president Juan Guaid&oacute; and the legitimate National Assembly.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Meridith Kohut for The New York Times\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 After denying for years that Venezuelans were suffering a humanitarian crisis, the government allowed the Red Cross to send in 24 tons of medical equipment on Tuesday, marking the beginning of a large-scale relief campaign intended to ease malnutrition and the spread of disease in the crisis-stricken country.\nAn airplane landed in Caracas\u2019s international airport transporting the first in a series of planned shipments of medical supplies and power generators for hospitals that are intended to eventually help 650,000 Venezuelans, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The material is expected to be distributed in the coming days.\nDespite the enormity of the population\u2019s need, the delivery of humanitarian aid has become a political battle between the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and Venezuela\u2019s opposition.\nOn Tuesday, the president of the Red Cross in Venezuela said the aid should not become embroiled in a political dispute, and asked for the cooperation of politicians.\n\u201cIt will be distributed in conformance with the fundamental principles of our movement, especially neutrality, impartiality and independence,\u201d Mario Villarroel, president of the Venezuelan Red Cross, said of the supplies. \u201cDon\u2019t allow the politicization of this great achievement.\u201d\nThe agency estimates its Venezuelan campaign could become its biggest relief effort since the beginning of civil war in Syria.\n[The United States\u2019 efforts to tighten oil sanctions against Venezuela and Iran risks unsettling global oil markets.]\nA recent United Nations report found about a quarter of the country\u2019s population is in dire need of food and basic supplies \u2014 and the need is expected to grow. The International Monetary Fund estimates the Venezuelan economy will shrink by 25 percent this year as infrastructure continues to crumble.\nAround 5,500 Venezuelans flee the country daily in what has become one of the world\u2019s biggest refugee crises, according to the United Nations.\nThe arrival of the aid shipment constitutes an about-face by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which for years had denied the existence of a humanitarian crisis despite the nation having endured the deepest economic depression in modern history among countries not at war.\nAs Venezuela\u2019s revenues have plummeted, control over aid supplies became one of the main political disputes between Mr. Maduro and a parallel government set up by Juan Guaid\u00f3. Mr. Guaid\u00f3, a leader of the opposition and of congress, invoked an article of Venezuela\u2019s Constitution in late January and claimed the country\u2019s leadership after pointing out widespread irregularities in the elections that gave Mr. Maduro a second term.\nIn February, an ambitious plan by the opposition, led by Mr. Guaid\u00f3, to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela from neighboring countries degenerated into bloody skirmishes as the trucks ran into blockades set up by security forces loyal to Mr. Maduro.\nMr. Guaid\u00f3 had hoped the plan would at once bring some relief to Venezuelans, strengthen his credibility as the country\u2019s new leader, and convince troops to turn against Mr. Maduro rather than use force to keep food and medication beyond the reach of a needy population.\nAlthough some military officials did cross the lines to join Mr. Guaid\u00f3, it was a trickle, not the sea change the opposition had envisioned. The blockade largely succeeded, with little aid entering the country.\n[On April 30, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 called for a military uprising.]\nSince then, the crisis has been compounded by the impact of American sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil industry. The measures are aimed at weakening Mr. Maduro and forcing him to cede power to Mr. Guaid\u00f3, who has the support of the United States and about 50 other countries, but the pain they inflict is felt first by the population.\nMr. Maduro\u2019s decision to accept the Red Cross aid has hobbled this parallel effort to deliver supplies that was mounted by the opposition. Still, it was celebrated by Mr. Maduro\u2019s opponents as a victory brought about by their persistence.\n\u201cToday, the first shipment of humanitarian aid arrived for our people,\u201d Henrique Capriles, a leading figure of the opposition, posted on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality thanks to the pressure of Venezuelans and the support of our interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the legitimate National Assembly.\u201d",

                "html": "<p>PARIS &mdash; Inside the cavernous cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, the last Mass of the day was underway on Monday of Holy Week when the first fire alarm went off. It was 6:20 p.m., 25 minutes before the heavy wooden doors were scheduled to close to visitors for the day.</p>\n<p>Worshipers, sightseers and staff were ushered out, and someone went up to check the most vulnerable part of the medieval structure &mdash; the attic, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/15/world/europe/paris-notre-dame-fire.html\">lattice of ancient wooden beams known as &ldquo;the forest&rdquo;</a> &mdash; but no fire was found, R&eacute;my Heitz, the Paris prosecutor, said on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>At 6:43 p.m., another alarm rang. It was just 23 minutes later, but when they returned to the attic, it was clear they had a major problem: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/world/europe/notre-dame-fire.html\">It was on fire</a>. Soon much of the roof and the delicate spire rising high above it were also engulfed in flames, fanned by a strong breeze.</p>\n<p>Exactly how the fire broke out is now the subject of an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/world/europe/notre-dame-fire-investigation.html\">intensive investigation</a> by the French authorities, who are so far treating the disaster as an accident.</p>\n<p>Much remains to be learned. But already it is emerging that Notre-Dame, irreplaceable as it is to France&rsquo;s heritage, lacked the fundamental fire-prevention safeguards that are required in more modern structures and have been grafted onto other ancient cathedrals elsewhere in Europe.</p>\n<p>Some of those elements, like firewalls or a sprinkler system, were absent by choice &mdash; so as not to alter the landmark&rsquo;s design or to introduce electrical wiring deemed a greater risk amid the timbers that supported Notre-Dame&rsquo;s ornate lead roof.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There had been a systematic refusal to install anything electrical&rdquo; within &ldquo;the forest&rdquo; because of the risk, said Pierre Housieaux, president of the Paris Historical Association. &ldquo;Everyone knew that the attic was the most fragile part.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Inevitably, some of those decisions are being called into question in the aftermath of a calamity that scarred a jewel of Gothic architecture precious to all the world, and left a gaping wound in the heart of Paris.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The risks at Notre-Dame were well known.

The flaming spire stood out over the city like a Roman candle until it toppled over, crashing through the ceiling and into the cathedral.</p>\n<p>As flaming pieces of the upper structure fell to the cathedral floor, some of the interior furnishings also caught fire.</p>\n<p><em>[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/notre-dame-university-fire.html\"><em>In Indiana, the cathedral fire inspired talk of a blaze 140 years ago at the University of Notre Dame.</em></a><em>]</em></p>\n<p>Firefighters deployed a robot equipped with tank-type treads and a camera to pull hoses into the cathedral and aim water at the flames. Firefighters also used aerial drones to get a view, including thermal imaging, into the inferno.</p>\n<p>The firefighters brought out irreplaceable artifacts, including candelabras, statues, furnishings and religious relics like a linen fabric associated with Saint Louis, and what tradition holds is the crown of thorns worn by Jesus. Mayor Anne Hidalgo described seeing them passing treasures hand to hand in a human chain.</p>\n<p>But in the absence of fire-prevention measures at the cathedral, there was only so much the firefighters could do.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The lack of fire security allowed the fire to spread quickly,&rdquo; said Jean-Michel Leniaud, the former director of the &Eacute;cole Nationale des Chartes, a French university institute that specializes in the sciences supporting historical work. &ldquo;If there were sprinklers everywhere it might have been different, but there weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Leniaud, who visited the interior of Notre-Dame on Tuesday, said the state, which owns and maintains the cathedral, had fire safety regulations for all buildings, but that &ldquo;sometimes they can be hard to apply.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Paradoxically, that can be especially so for some of its most cherished structures. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always been a hesitation to disfigure the monument in question,&rdquo; Mr. Leniaud said.</p>\n<p>One reason the fire swept through the open space beneath the roof is that there were no barriers &mdash; sometimes called firewalls &mdash; to compartmentalize the blaze until firefighters could arrive, said Jim Lygate, a visiting professor of fire investigation at University of Edinburgh. For that reason, he said, such barriers are legally required in similar structures in Britain.</p>\n<p>That is not to say that Paris&rsquo;s firefighters were unprepared for potential calamity. Scores of them drilled regularly for just such an emergency at Notre-Dame. That proved critical to saving many of its treasures.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t act without planning,&rdquo; said Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the Paris fire brigade. &ldquo;We know the cathedral.

                "text": "PARIS \u2014 Inside the cavernous cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, the last Mass of the day was underway on Monday of Holy Week when the first fire alarm went off. It was 6:20 p.m., 25 minutes before the heavy wooden doors were scheduled to close to visitors for the day.\nWorshipers, sightseers and staff were ushered out, and someone went up to check the most vulnerable part of the medieval structure \u2014 the attic, a lattice of ancient wooden beams known as \u201cthe forest\u201d \u2014 but no fire was found, R\u00e9my Heitz, the Paris prosecutor, said on Tuesday.\nAt 6:43 p.m., another alarm rang. It was just 23 minutes later, but when they returned to the attic, it was clear they had a major problem: It was on fire. Soon much of the roof and the delicate spire rising high above it were also engulfed in flames, fanned by a strong breeze.\nExactly how the fire broke out is now the subject of an intensive investigation by the French authorities, who are so far treating the disaster as an accident.\nMuch remains to be learned. But already it is emerging that Notre-Dame, irreplaceable as it is to France\u2019s heritage, lacked the fundamental fire-prevention safeguards that are required in more modern structures and have been grafted onto other ancient cathedrals elsewhere in Europe.\nSome of those elements, like firewalls or a sprinkler system, were absent by choice \u2014 so as not to alter the landmark\u2019s design or to introduce electrical wiring deemed a greater risk amid the timbers that supported Notre-Dame\u2019s ornate lead roof.\n\u201cThere had been a systematic refusal to install anything electrical\u201d within \u201cthe forest\u201d because of the risk, said Pierre Housieaux, president of the Paris Historical Association. \u201cEveryone knew that the attic was the most fragile part.\u201d\nInevitably, some of those decisions are being called into question in the aftermath of a calamity that scarred a jewel of Gothic architecture precious to all the world, and left a gaping wound in the heart of Paris.\n\u201cThe fire-detection system existed, not the fire compartments,\u201d said Jacques Chanut, president of the French Building Federation, referring to the structures commonly used elsewhere to contain blazes. \u201cThat\u2019s the typical example of something we are going to have to think about tomorrow.\u201d\nHowever it began, the fire galloped unimpeded across the attic and roof, and up the wood structure inside the spire. The flaming spire stood out over the city like a Roman candle until it toppled over, crashing through the ceiling and into the cathedral.\nAs flaming pieces of the upper structure fell to the cathedral floor, some of the interior furnishings also caught fire.\n[In Indiana, the cathedral fire inspired talk of a blaze 140 years ago at the University of Notre Dame.]\nFirefighters deployed a robot equipped with tank-type treads and a camera to pull hoses into the cathedral and aim water at the flames. Firefighters also used aerial drones to get a view, including thermal imaging, into the inferno.\nThe firefighters brought out irreplaceable artifacts, including candelabras, statues, furnishings and religious relics like a linen fabric associated with Saint Louis, and what tradition holds is the crown of thorns worn by Jesus. Mayor Anne Hidalgo described seeing them passing treasures hand to hand in a human chain.\nBut in the absence of fire-prevention measures at the cathedral, there was only so much the firefighters could do.\n\u201cThe lack of fire security allowed the fire to spread quickly,\u201d said Jean-Michel Leniaud, the former director of the \u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes, a French university institute that specializes in the sciences supporting historical work. \u201cIf there were sprinklers everywhere it might have been different, but there weren\u2019t.\u201d\nMr. Leniaud, who visited the interior of Notre-Dame on Tuesday, said the state, which owns and maintains the cathedral, had fire safety regulations for all buildings, but that \u201csometimes they can be hard to apply.\u201d\nParadoxically, that can be especially so for some of its most cherished structures. \u201cThere\u2019s always been a hesitation to disfigure the monument in question,\u201d Mr. Leniaud said.\nOne reason the fire swept through the open space beneath the roof is that there were no barriers \u2014 sometimes called firewalls \u2014 to compartmentalize the blaze until firefighters could arrive, said Jim Lygate, a visiting professor of fire investigation at University of Edinburgh. For that reason, he said, such barriers are legally required in similar structures in Britain.\nThat is not to say that Paris\u2019s firefighters were unprepared for potential calamity. Scores of them drilled regularly for just such an emergency at Notre-Dame. That proved critical to saving many of its treasures.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t act without planning,\u201d said Gabriel Plus, a spokesman for the Paris fire brigade. \u201cWe know the cathedral. So we know what to do when something like that happens, we know, for instance, that we need to deploy boats on the Seine really quickly to pump large amounts of water.\u201d\nAbout 500 firefighters responded, some of them unfurling hoses and training them on the blaze. About 100 focused on saving its religious and cultural treasures, Mr. Plus said.\n\u201cOnce we realized that the roof would be partially lost, we aimed to stop the fire at the two towers, in order to limit the damage,\u201d he said.\nLaurent Nu\u00f1ez, France\u2019s junior interior minister, said about 20 firefighters had risked their lives by entering the towers to battle the fire, \u201cwhich enabled the building to be saved.\u201d\n\u201cFor 15 minutes, half an hour, it could have gone either way,\u201d he said.\nThe danger of a disastrous fire among the attic timbers was well known.\n\u201cAt the cathedral, we have fire monitors,\u201d Msgr. Patrick Chauvet, rector of the cathedral, told the radio station France Inter on Tuesday. \u201cThree times a day they go up, under the wooden roof, to make an assessment.\u201d\nNotre-Dame had an on-site firefighter, posted daily at a command post on the floor of the structure, and a security agent, said Andr\u00e9 Finot, a spokesman for the cathedral. In case of an alarm, the firefighter would dispatch the security agent to the area where it rang.\nParis firefighters held two training exercises at Notre-Dame last year, focused on saving the relics and works of art, Mr. Plus said.\nLt.-Col. Jos\u00e9 Vaz de Matos, an official who works on inspecting France\u2019s national monuments, said, \u201ca good number of priceless collections were saved and brought to safety.\u201d But large items, \u201csome of which have been affected by the fire,\u201d remained inside, he said.\n\u201cAt this stage, we are not able to send our teams to recover them,\u201d he said.\nBy late Monday night, most of the damage had been done. But it was not until Tuesday morning that the fire brigade declared the blaze extinguished, and firefighters spent the day watching for hot spots and continuing to pull valuables from the building.\nFranck Riester, the culture minister, said on Tuesday that the cathedral\u2019s famous rose windows did not appear to have been damaged. But there were three major holes in the ceiling, one of them caused by the collapse of the spire.\nBefore the blaze, restoration work had begun and much of the building was sheathed in scaffolding, which was still being erected. Julien Le Bras, the chief executive of Le Bras Fr\u00e8res, the company that handles the cathedral\u2019s scaffolding, told reporters that 12 employees worked on the site, but that none were there when the fire started.\nExperts say that restoration, which often involves combustible chemicals and electrical tools, always presents a fire danger, as does electrical wiring.\nMr. Housieaux, the Paris Historical Association president, noted that in the last decade, fires linked to restoration work had destroyed the town hall of La Rochelle, and the Hotel Lambert on the \u00cele Saint-Louis, one of the small islands in the Seine in Paris.\nThe Notre-Dame restoration project was to focus on reinforcing the spire and repairing some of the attic beams, said Olivier de Chalus, a construction engineer and volunteer guide at the cathedral. He described the structure under the roof as \u201cthe cathedral\u2019s jewel, the true piece of art that wasn\u2019t accessible to many.\u201d\nBut experts say the beams, many of them dating to the cathedral\u2019s construction in the 12th and 13th centuries, became tinder-dry as they aged.\nExperts will analyze the building to gauge the risk of collapse, officials said. Stabilizing it is likely to involve removing the damaged scaffolds, erecting new ones, and taking steps to protect the mortar between stones, which may have been weakened by the fire, from eroding when it rains.\nMr. Nu\u00f1ez, the junior interior minister, said that while \u201coverall the structure is holding,\u201d inspectors had identified \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in the arched ceiling and in a gable of the northern transept. He said that five apartment buildings on Rue du Clo\u00eetre, which runs along the cathedral\u2019s northern edge, had been evacuated for 48 hours as a precaution.\nMr. Heitz said that nearly 50 investigators were working on finding the cause of the fire, but he warned that the inquiry will be long and complex. So far, he said, the hypothesis is that it was an accident.\n\u201cNothing at this stage suggests a voluntary act,\u201d he said.",

The doctor explained that Stephanie Spoor, 64, had contracted a &ldquo;rare, very rare, fungus.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The physician said the fungus was called Candida auris, and it appeared to have entered her bloodstream through a catheter or other intravenous line during her treatment. Mr. Spoor sent a text to the couple&rsquo;s four children.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Hey guys, I&rsquo;m very sorry to do this via text but you need to know and not fair to wait until all of us are together,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;The fungus mom has is the worst possible and can be terminal.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He added: &ldquo;It is a day to day issue so I don&rsquo;t have any more answers or info at this time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Mr. Spoor, 67, an executive at a plumbing equipment company, wasn&rsquo;t the only one with few answers. C. auris, a germ that typically is resistant to major antifungal medications, has been quietly confounding doctors, hospitals and infectious disease scientists around the world.</p>\n<p>First identified in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (&ldquo;auris&rdquo; is Latin for &ldquo;ear&rdquo;), the germ has<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html\"> spread around the globe</a>, mostly appearing in hospitals and nursing homes, where it afflicts people with weakened immune systems.</p>\n<p>Nearly 600 cases of C. auris <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html\">have been reported</a> in the United States, the majority of them in New York, New Jersey and Illinois. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of people who contract the illness die within 90 days. But the true death rate is difficult to quantify because most patients have other medical conditions and their deaths may be attributed to other causes.</p>\n<p>About 90 percent of C. auris strains are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more of the three major classes of antifungal drugs. However, on Tuesday, the C.D.C. confirmed that it has learned in the last month of the first known cases in the United States of so-called &ldquo;pan-resistant&rdquo; C. auris &mdash; a strain resistant to all major antifungals, said Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the agency&rsquo;s fungal division, in an interview.</p>\n<p>Such cases have been seen in several countries, including India and South Africa, but the two new cases, from New York State, have not been reported previously. Dr. Chiller said that it appeared that, in each case, the germ evolved during treatment and became pan-resistant, confirming a fear that the infection will continue to develop more effective defenses.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happening and it&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; Dr. Chiller said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we need to remain vigilant and rapidly identify and control these infections.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>It often has been hard to gather details about the path of C. auris because hospitals and nursing homes have been unwilling to publicly disclose outbreaks or discuss cases, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/candida-auris-hospitals-drug-resistant.html\">creating a culture of secrecy</a> around the infection. States have kept confidential the locations of hospitals where outbreaks have occurred, citing patient confidentiality and a risk of unnecessarily scaring the public.</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s family contacted The New York Times to share details of her case after reading <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html\">an article in the newspaper about the emergence of C. auris</a> and the growing threat of drug resistant infections. Her experience sheds some light on the experience of dealing with the new health threat.</p>\n<p>Northwestern Memorial has not issued any public announcement that it had cases of C. auris. The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s case after the family gave officials permission to discuss it with The Times. But it would not disclose the identities of what it called &ldquo;numerous&rdquo; hospitals and nursing homes that have reported a total of 158 cases in the state since 2016.</p>\n<p>Northwestern Memorial declined to answer any questions from The Times about Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s case, despite receiving permission from the Spoor family to cooperate.</p>\n<p>The hospital also declined to respond to questions about how many C. auris cases it has treated, whether there were any current cases, what precautions it was taking and other queries.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;After careful consideration, we are going to pass on participating in this story,&rdquo; Christopher King, a hospital spokesman, wrote in an email in response to questions.</p>\n<p>Generally, health care institutions have said that they do not want to worry the public unnecessarily, given that they are working hard to control the spread of the infection and also that the germ is not a health threat to the general public. The people at the greatest risk are those who have compromised immune systems, typically through illness and age, and who are in hospitals and nursing homes where many infections are carried and transmitted.</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s tale reveals the powerlessness of patients and institutions in the face of resistant infections.</p>\n<p>Late last year, Ms. Spoor began experiencing shortness of breath and appeared to be having a surge of symptoms from lupus, an autoimmune disorder she had been diagnosed with years earlier but that did not seem to disrupt her daily life. Now, her lungs were having trouble absorbing oxygen.</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s family kept a detailed diary of the events, at her request. She went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a highly ranked academic medical center affiliated with Northwestern University. There, in mid-December, she had a biopsy that led to complications: The wound bled and she went into cardiac arrest. She was revived and put on a device called an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to help her breathe.</p>\n<p>That machine was considered a way station to help Ms. Spoor survive until she could receive a lung transplant. She felt hopeful she would be able to see her youngest son, Zack, get married in a ceremony planned for June.</p>\n<p>But a month later, a blood test found C. auris. Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s medical records, which the family shared with The Times, contained a note in mid-January in bold type: &ldquo;This is a highly transmissible fungus that has a propensity to develop resistance.&rdquo; The records continued, again in bold type, that it was necessary to &ldquo;discuss with nurses to maintain diligent contact precautions and limited visitors if possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those records indicated that the hospital suspected Ms. Spoor picked up the infection from one of the tubes inserted into her body.</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s son Nicholas, 40, a Chicago architect, said that the day his mother was diagnosed with C. auris, he noticed the nurses and doctors in full protective aprons and gloves, using bleach to wipe off their feet when they entered and left the room. Everything in the room had a white glaze, he said, from the chemicals used to clean it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was like a laboratory,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>But the family was hopeful. A doctor told them, Nicholas recalled, &ldquo;that the strain they had had at Northwestern had been susceptible to the drug cocktail they were currently giving her, and they expected it to clear up.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><strong><em>[</em></strong><strong><a href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\"><em>Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><em>| Sign up for the </em><strong><a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\"><em>Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong><em>]</em></strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, according to the medical records, initial lab tests suggested that the strain of C. auris that had infected Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s bloodstream was susceptible to the hospital&rsquo;s drug treatment.</p>\n<p>The records also included hints of doubt. &ldquo;Limited literature on C. auris indicates a relatively high mortality and this pathogen may be difficult to eradicate,&rdquo; a Jan. 19 notation said.</p>\n<p>Over the latter half of January, doctors and nurses furiously tried to treat the fungus, but it kept growing back. The drugs weren&rsquo;t working. Ms. Spoor appeared fatigued, the family said, but was not showing any other particularly obvious signs of infection.</p>\n<p>Barely two months earlier, before her biopsy, Ms. Spoor had been thrilled to accept an early Christmas present from the family: She attended a speech by Michelle Obama at the United Center in downtown Chicago.</p>\n<p>Now, in the early days of February, she and her family were being told to put her affairs in order. A doctor told Ms. Spoor that there was nothing more to be done. A transplant wasn&rsquo;t realistic until she was clear of C. auris, but there seemed to be no effective treatment for the infection.</p>\n<p>On Feb. 8, their grief was suspended briefly and the atmosphere in her hospital room turned celebratory. The Spoors&rsquo; youngest son, Zack, married his fianc&eacute;e, Carley, in a wedding ceremony at her bedside.</p>\n<p>Bride and groom wore protective blue hospital gowns over their formal wear, and blue gloves. After the chaplain pronounced them husband and wife, said a blessing and an &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Ms. Spoor grinned as if she had beat the devil at cards.</p>\n<p>A few days later, after consulting with the family, doctors removed Ms. Spoor from the oxygenation machine &mdash; her life support, essentially. In the hours before, Ms. Spoor said there was one last person she&rsquo;d like to speak with: her son Nicholas, with whom she had not yet had a final heart-to-heart conversation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;She just said what you&rsquo;d expect a mom to say to you in that situation,&rdquo; Mr. Spoor recounted. He tried to elaborate, but began to cry: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it. She just said the exact right thing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor died on Feb. 11. Her death certificate describes the cause as respiratory failure.</p>\n<p>Dr. Rosalind Ramsey-Goldman, a rheumatologist who treated Ms. Spoor, said she felt for the family. &ldquo;Understandably, her family has had a hard time dealing with their loss,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And as providers, we too were saddened by the events that transpired, and that we were not able to help her when she had this infection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Ms. Spoor&rsquo;s husband, Greg, said he bore no grudge against the hospital and, in fact, found its care exceptional. He said he wished that he had known to ask about C. auris and the precautions the hospital was taking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was something that we didn&rsquo;t even know was out there, and then it happened and it was one of the major reasons she died,&rdquo; said her son Nicholas. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not sharing the data about the patients, that&rsquo;s an issue.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Spoor family photo\nGregory Spoor got the distressing news about his wife on the morning of Jan. 16 while standing outside her room in the intensive care unit at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The doctor explained that Stephanie Spoor, 64, had contracted a \u201crare, very rare, fungus.\u201d\nThe physician said the fungus was called Candida auris, and it appeared to have entered her bloodstream through a catheter or other intravenous line during her treatment. Mr. Spoor sent a text to the couple\u2019s four children.\n\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m very sorry to do this via text but you need to know and not fair to wait until all of us are together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fungus mom has is the worst possible and can be terminal.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt is a day to day issue so I don\u2019t have any more answers or info at this time.\u201d\nMr. Spoor, 67, an executive at a plumbing equipment company, wasn\u2019t the only one with few answers. C. auris, a germ that typically is resistant to major antifungal medications, has been quietly confounding doctors, hospitals and infectious disease scientists around the world.\nFirst identified in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (\u201cauris\u201d is Latin for \u201cear\u201d), the germ has spread around the globe, mostly appearing in hospitals and nursing homes, where it afflicts people with weakened immune systems.\nNearly 600 cases of C. auris have been reported in the United States, the majority of them in New York, New Jersey and Illinois. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of people who contract the illness die within 90 days. But the true death rate is difficult to quantify because most patients have other medical conditions and their deaths may be attributed to other causes.\nAbout 90 percent of C. auris strains are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more of the three major classes of antifungal drugs. However, on Tuesday, the C.D.C. confirmed that it has learned in the last month of the first known cases in the United States of so-called \u201cpan-resistant\u201d C. auris \u2014 a strain resistant to all major antifungals, said Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the agency\u2019s fungal division, in an interview.\nSuch cases have been seen in several countries, including India and South Africa, but the two new cases, from New York State, have not been reported previously. Dr. Chiller said that it appeared that, in each case, the germ evolved during treatment and became pan-resistant, confirming a fear that the infection will continue to develop more effective defenses.\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening and it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Dr. Chiller said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to remain vigilant and rapidly identify and control these infections.\u201d\nIt often has been hard to gather details about the path of C. auris because hospitals and nursing homes have been unwilling to publicly disclose outbreaks or discuss cases, creating a culture of secrecy around the infection. States have kept confidential the locations of hospitals where outbreaks have occurred, citing patient confidentiality and a risk of unnecessarily scaring the public.\nMs. Spoor\u2019s family contacted The New York Times to share details of her case after reading an article in the newspaper about the emergence of C. auris and the growing threat of drug resistant infections. Her experience sheds some light on the experience of dealing with the new health threat.\nNorthwestern Memorial has not issued any public announcement that it had cases of C. auris. The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Ms. Spoor\u2019s case after the family gave officials permission to discuss it with The Times. But it would not disclose the identities of what it called \u201cnumerous\u201d hospitals and nursing homes that have reported a total of 158 cases in the state since 2016.\nNorthwestern Memorial declined to answer any questions from The Times about Ms. Spoor\u2019s case, despite receiving permission from the Spoor family to cooperate.\nThe hospital also declined to respond to questions about how many C. auris cases it has treated, whether there were any current cases, what precautions it was taking and other queries.\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, we are going to pass on participating in this story,\u201d Christopher King, a hospital spokesman, wrote in an email in response to questions.\nGenerally, health care institutions have said that they do not want to worry the public unnecessarily, given that they are working hard to control the spread of the infection and also that the germ is not a health threat to the general public. The people at the greatest risk are those who have compromised immune systems, typically through illness and age, and who are in hospitals and nursing homes where many infections are carried and transmitted.\nMs. Spoor\u2019s tale reveals the powerlessness of patients and institutions in the face of resistant infections.\nLate last year, Ms. Spoor began experiencing shortness of breath and appeared to be having a surge of symptoms from lupus, an autoimmune disorder she had been diagnosed with years earlier but that did not seem to disrupt her daily life. Now, her lungs were having trouble absorbing oxygen.\nMs. Spoor\u2019s family kept a detailed diary of the events, at her request. She went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a highly ranked academic medical center affiliated with Northwestern University. There, in mid-December, she had a biopsy that led to complications: The wound bled and she went into cardiac arrest. She was revived and put on a device called an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to help her breathe.\nThat machine was considered a way station to help Ms. Spoor survive until she could receive a lung transplant. She felt hopeful she would be able to see her youngest son, Zack, get married in a ceremony planned for June.\nBut a month later, a blood test found C. auris. Ms. Spoor\u2019s medical records, which the family shared with The Times, contained a note in mid-January in bold type: \u201cThis is a highly transmissible fungus that has a propensity to develop resistance.\u201d The records continued, again in bold type, that it was necessary to \u201cdiscuss with nurses to maintain diligent contact precautions and limited visitors if possible.\u201d\nThose records indicated that the hospital suspected Ms. Spoor picked up the infection from one of the tubes inserted into her body.\nMs. Spoor\u2019s son Nicholas, 40, a Chicago architect, said that the day his mother was diagnosed with C. auris, he noticed the nurses and doctors in full protective aprons and gloves, using bleach to wipe off their feet when they entered and left the room. Everything in the room had a white glaze, he said, from the chemicals used to clean it.\n\u201cIt was like a laboratory,\u201d he said.\nBut the family was hopeful. A doctor told them, Nicholas recalled, \u201cthat the strain they had had at Northwestern had been susceptible to the drug cocktail they were currently giving her, and they expected it to clear up.\u201d\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\nIndeed, according to the medical records, initial lab tests suggested that the strain of C. auris that had infected Ms. Spoor\u2019s bloodstream was susceptible to the hospital\u2019s drug treatment.\nThe records also included hints of doubt. \u201cLimited literature on C. auris indicates a relatively high mortality and this pathogen may be difficult to eradicate,\u201d a Jan. 19 notation said.\nOver the latter half of January, doctors and nurses furiously tried to treat the fungus, but it kept growing back. The drugs weren\u2019t working. Ms. Spoor appeared fatigued, the family said, but was not showing any other particularly obvious signs of infection.\nBarely two months earlier, before her biopsy, Ms. Spoor had been thrilled to accept an early Christmas present from the family: She attended a speech by Michelle Obama at the United Center in downtown Chicago.\nNow, in the early days of February, she and her family were being told to put her affairs in order. A doctor told Ms. Spoor that there was nothing more to be done. A transplant wasn\u2019t realistic until she was clear of C. auris, but there seemed to be no effective treatment for the infection.\nOn Feb. 8, their grief was suspended briefly and the atmosphere in her hospital room turned celebratory. The Spoors\u2019 youngest son, Zack, married his fianc\u00e9e, Carley, in a wedding ceremony at her bedside.\nBride and groom wore protective blue hospital gowns over their formal wear, and blue gloves. After the chaplain pronounced them husband and wife, said a blessing and an \u201cAmen,\u201d Ms. Spoor grinned as if she had beat the devil at cards.\nA few days later, after consulting with the family, doctors removed Ms. Spoor from the oxygenation machine \u2014 her life support, essentially. In the hours before, Ms. Spoor said there was one last person she\u2019d like to speak with: her son Nicholas, with whom she had not yet had a final heart-to-heart conversation.\n\u201cShe just said what you\u2019d expect a mom to say to you in that situation,\u201d Mr. Spoor recounted. He tried to elaborate, but began to cry: \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it. She just said the exact right thing.\u201d\nMs. Spoor died on Feb. 11. Her death certificate describes the cause as respiratory failure.\nDr. Rosalind Ramsey-Goldman, a rheumatologist who treated Ms. Spoor, said she felt for the family. \u201cUnderstandably, her family has had a hard time dealing with their loss,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as providers, we too were saddened by the events that transpired, and that we were not able to help her when she had this infection.\u201d\nMs. Spoor\u2019s husband, Greg, said he bore no grudge against the hospital and, in fact, found its care exceptional. He said he wished that he had known to ask about C. auris and the precautions the hospital was taking.\n\u201cIt was something that we didn\u2019t even know was out there, and then it happened and it was one of the major reasons she died,\u201d said her son Nicholas. \u201cIf you\u2019re not sharing the data about the patients, that\u2019s an issue.\u201d",

John McDonald, the school safety executive director for Jefferson County Public Schools, which includes Columbine, called it a &ldquo;pilgrimage.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>To many parents, the school closings and the frenzied manhunt drove fears that Columbine still had the power to captivate would-be attackers and that the community would never be free from the massacre, which took place on April 20, 1999, and left 12 students and one teacher dead.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What does this mean for tomorrow and the next day?&rdquo; asked Dana Gutwein, 34, who has a first grader and third grader in the Jefferson County Public Schools District, which includes Columbine. Ms. Gutwein was unsure whether she would immediately let her children go back to class when the hundreds of schools that had closed on Wednesday reopen.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt like I&rsquo;m on the verge of throwing up since this started,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Across the Denver metro area, parents struggled to find the right words to explain the latest safety warnings to children who have grown up in an anxious era of lockdowns and active-shooter drills. At Columbine, students who were organizing a day of service to mark the 20-year anniversary saw their preparations eclipsed by emergency text messages from the school district, news alerts on their phones and dread.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This week our message was supposed to be about love and recommitment,&rdquo; said Rachel Hill, 17, a senior at Columbine. &ldquo;But now all the news surrounding Columbine is about fear.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Some parents said they told their children to play close to home on Wednesday. Others shook their heads at how a threat from one teenager could keep half a million students home from school and throw an entire city into panic.</p>\n<p>As the anniversary approaches, the threat and the fears have turned what was supposed to be a time of healing into a renewed source of trauma, said Urania Glassman, a clinical social worker and professor at Yeshiva University in New York.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You have somebody who wants to throw a grenade on that parade and so do harm again,&rdquo; Dr. Glassman said. &ldquo;It retraumatizes people who were present and survived, it retraumatizes the families and it retraumatizes the communities.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even 20 years later, young people across America <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/us/school-shootings-columbine.html\">continue to be influenced</a> by the symbology of the Columbine shooting and the students who carried it out, according to researchers and educators.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials said that Ms. Pais, a student at Miami Beach Senior High School, had been &ldquo;infatuated&rdquo; with the Columbine shooting and had made alarming social media posts and threatening statements to friends and family.</p>\n<p>On Monday, she flew from Miami to Denver and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a store in Littleton, not far from Columbine High School.</p>\n<p>Colorado tightened its background check laws in recent years, but it does not have a set waiting period before buying a gun.</p>\n<p>Ms. Pais&rsquo;s parents in Surfside, Fla., reported her missing to local police on Monday. They provided investigators with information that helped them track her to Colorado, said Chief Julio Yero of the Surfside Police.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officials issued warnings on Tuesday expressing concerns about Ms. Pais&rsquo;s mental stability and saying that she was armed and &ldquo;extremely dangerous.&rdquo; They launched what they called a &ldquo;massive manhunt.&rdquo; Schools across suburban Denver, already anxious about the approaching anniversary of the shooting, locked all their doors and stepped up security.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We are used to threats certainly at Columbine,&rdquo; said Mr. McDonald, the school safety director. &ldquo;This one felt different.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Sheriff Jeff Shrader of Jefferson County, Colo., said it did not appear that Ms. Pais had any help from friends in the area, just a fascination with Columbine and the horrendous crime that took place there.</p>\n<p>At Miami Beach Senior High School, Katherin DeVargas Gil, a 17-year-old senior who took freshman Spanish and A.P. studio art with Ms. Pais this year, described her as &ldquo;kind of in a corner.&rdquo; Classmates said she was quiet and intelligent, but Ms. DeVargas Gil said a social media account with disturbing posts attributed to a Sol Pais had also made the rounds among her classmates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We talked about it in our first-period class,&rdquo; Ms. DeVargas Gil said. &ldquo;I even texted my mom, crying, saying I don&rsquo;t want to be here.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Brandon Bossard, a sophomore who had a second-period class with Ms. Pais, said she usually sat in chairs up against the classroom wall, alone.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t believe it. I didn&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so quiet. How could someone so quiet be like that?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>An online journal that the authorities said they were investigating in connection with Ms. Pais read like a catalog of isolation, depression and anguish, illustrated with pictures of knives and guns. In a July 2018 entry, the journal writer described waking up every day feeling &ldquo;lost, hopeless, angry, pissed off.&rdquo; F.B.I. officials would not say on Wednesday whether they had determined if Ms. Pais was the author.</p>\n<p>It was a tactical team from the Clear Creek County sheriff&rsquo;s department that found Ms. Pais&rsquo;s body, near Echo Lake, according to the sheriff, Rick Albers. According to the sheriff, Ms. Pais had taken a rideshare to a lodge by the lake.</p>\n<p>At some point she had hiked about half a mile from the lodge, and then about 100 yards up a hill. She would have had to hike through snow to get there, somewhere between one and four feet deep, officials said. Clear Creek deputies found her by a stump, dead from a gunshot wound. She was in the same clothing the F.B.I. had reported her as wearing &mdash; boots, camouflage pants and a black shirt. She was also wearing a plaid jacket, and had a bag and a shotgun with her. Mr. Albers said that he did not know of any other guns found on her.</p>\n<p>For some of the youngest students at home on Wednesday, the episode was their first introduction to the Columbine shooting, and to its legacy of worry and tripwire responses to threats to schools.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad and scary,&rdquo; said Jeff Desserich, a math teacher at a charter school in Denver, who spent the morning trying to explain to his daughters Anais, 8, and Elena, 6, why they would not be going to class.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;There is a lady, she probably has some sort of mental health issue,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And I talked a little about the sad events of Columbine.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Emily Fern, whose 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter go to school in Littleton, sat in bed on Wednesday morning debating whether to say anything at all to her children about why they were staying home. Her son, Hayden, loves Spider-Man and superheroes, so Ms. Fern decided to explain the threat in terms of &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad guys.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Before leaving for her job as a hair stylist, Ms. Fern, 38, said she told her babysitter not to go farther than the front lawn of their cul-de-sac on Wednesday, and to run inside, lock the doors and call 911 if she saw anything suspicious.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Just that feeling that she could be lurking in the neighborhoods,&rdquo; Ms. Fern said of the threat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re kind of looking everywhere.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In Jefferson County, officials were making contingency plans to reopen schools, even if that meant overcoming logistical hurdles like changes in transportation and food service. &ldquo;We did not wish to have one person hold all of the schools in the front range of the whole state hostage,&rdquo; said Jason Glass, the schools superintendent.</p>\n<p>Mr. Glass said even though those plans had not been implemented and schools would open on Thursday, they would be saved for the future.</p>\n<p>Mr. McDonald, the school safety director, said the system did not want to play into the fascination with Columbine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a place to come visit if you&rsquo;re not a student,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a tourist attraction. We&rsquo;re not a place for you to come and gain inspiration.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, via Associated Press\nDENVER \u2014 The 20th anniversary of the attack at Columbine High School was supposed to be marked with prayers and memorials.\nInstead, millions of parents, students and educators across Colorado awoke on Wednesday to news that an armed 18-year-old woman with an infatuation with the massacre had flown across the country to Colorado and that hundreds of schools had closed as a precaution as the authorities frantically searched for her.\nBy day\u2019s end, the woman, a Florida high school student identified as Sol Pais, was discovered dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in the mountains west of Denver.\n[Here is what we know about Sol Pais.]\nLaw enforcement officials said they had been worried by Ms. Pais\u2019s determination: She bought a plane ticket, made the journey and bought a gun. John McDonald, the school safety executive director for Jefferson County Public Schools, which includes Columbine, called it a \u201cpilgrimage.\u201d\nTo many parents, the school closings and the frenzied manhunt drove fears that Columbine still had the power to captivate would-be attackers and that the community would never be free from the massacre, which took place on April 20, 1999, and left 12 students and one teacher dead.\n\u201cWhat does this mean for tomorrow and the next day?\u201d asked Dana Gutwein, 34, who has a first grader and third grader in the Jefferson County Public Schools District, which includes Columbine. Ms. Gutwein was unsure whether she would immediately let her children go back to class when the hundreds of schools that had closed on Wednesday reopen.\n\u201cI\u2019ve felt like I\u2019m on the verge of throwing up since this started,\u201d she said.\nAcross the Denver metro area, parents struggled to find the right words to explain the latest safety warnings to children who have grown up in an anxious era of lockdowns and active-shooter drills. At Columbine, students who were organizing a day of service to mark the 20-year anniversary saw their preparations eclipsed by emergency text messages from the school district, news alerts on their phones and dread.\n\u201cThis week our message was supposed to be about love and recommitment,\u201d said Rachel Hill, 17, a senior at Columbine. \u201cBut now all the news surrounding Columbine is about fear.\u201d\nSome parents said they told their children to play close to home on Wednesday. Others shook their heads at how a threat from one teenager could keep half a million students home from school and throw an entire city into panic.\nAs the anniversary approaches, the threat and the fears have turned what was supposed to be a time of healing into a renewed source of trauma, said Urania Glassman, a clinical social worker and professor at Yeshiva University in New York.\n\u201cYou have somebody who wants to throw a grenade on that parade and so do harm again,\u201d Dr. Glassman said. \u201cIt retraumatizes people who were present and survived, it retraumatizes the families and it retraumatizes the communities.\u201d\nEven 20 years later, young people across America continue to be influenced by the symbology of the Columbine shooting and the students who carried it out, according to researchers and educators.\nLaw enforcement officials said that Ms. Pais, a student at Miami Beach Senior High School, had been \u201cinfatuated\u201d with the Columbine shooting and had made alarming social media posts and threatening statements to friends and family.\nOn Monday, she flew from Miami to Denver and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition at a store in Littleton, not far from Columbine High School.\nColorado tightened its background check laws in recent years, but it does not have a set waiting period before buying a gun.\nMs. Pais\u2019s parents in Surfside, Fla., reported her missing to local police on Monday. They provided investigators with information that helped them track her to Colorado, said Chief Julio Yero of the Surfside Police.\nLaw enforcement officials issued warnings on Tuesday expressing concerns about Ms. Pais\u2019s mental stability and saying that she was armed and \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d They launched what they called a \u201cmassive manhunt.\u201d Schools across suburban Denver, already anxious about the approaching anniversary of the shooting, locked all their doors and stepped up security.\n\u201cWe are used to threats certainly at Columbine,\u201d said Mr. McDonald, the school safety director. \u201cThis one felt different.\u201d\nSheriff Jeff Shrader of Jefferson County, Colo., said it did not appear that Ms. Pais had any help from friends in the area, just a fascination with Columbine and the horrendous crime that took place there.\nAt Miami Beach Senior High School, Katherin DeVargas Gil, a 17-year-old senior who took freshman Spanish and A.P. studio art with Ms. Pais this year, described her as \u201ckind of in a corner.\u201d Classmates said she was quiet and intelligent, but Ms. DeVargas Gil said a social media account with disturbing posts attributed to a Sol Pais had also made the rounds among her classmates.\n\u201cWe talked about it in our first-period class,\u201d Ms. DeVargas Gil said. \u201cI even texted my mom, crying, saying I don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d\nBrandon Bossard, a sophomore who had a second-period class with Ms. Pais, said she usually sat in chairs up against the classroom wall, alone.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s so quiet. How could someone so quiet be like that?\u201d\nAn online journal that the authorities said they were investigating in connection with Ms. Pais read like a catalog of isolation, depression and anguish, illustrated with pictures of knives and guns. In a July 2018 entry, the journal writer described waking up every day feeling \u201clost, hopeless, angry, pissed off.\u201d F.B.I. officials would not say on Wednesday whether they had determined if Ms. Pais was the author.\nIt was a tactical team from the Clear Creek County sheriff\u2019s department that found Ms. Pais\u2019s body, near Echo Lake, according to the sheriff, Rick Albers. According to the sheriff, Ms. Pais had taken a rideshare to a lodge by the lake.\nAt some point she had hiked about half a mile from the lodge, and then about 100 yards up a hill. She would have had to hike through snow to get there, somewhere between one and four feet deep, officials said. Clear Creek deputies found her by a stump, dead from a gunshot wound. She was in the same clothing the F.B.I. had reported her as wearing \u2014 boots, camouflage pants and a black shirt. She was also wearing a plaid jacket, and had a bag and a shotgun with her. Mr. Albers said that he did not know of any other guns found on her.\nFor some of the youngest students at home on Wednesday, the episode was their first introduction to the Columbine shooting, and to its legacy of worry and tripwire responses to threats to schools.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad and scary,\u201d said Jeff Desserich, a math teacher at a charter school in Denver, who spent the morning trying to explain to his daughters Anais, 8, and Elena, 6, why they would not be going to class.\n\u201cI said, \u2018There is a lady, she probably has some sort of mental health issue,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I talked a little about the sad events of Columbine.\u201d\nEmily Fern, whose 5-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter go to school in Littleton, sat in bed on Wednesday morning debating whether to say anything at all to her children about why they were staying home. Her son, Hayden, loves Spider-Man and superheroes, so Ms. Fern decided to explain the threat in terms of \u201cgood guys\u201d and \u201cbad guys.\u201d\nBefore leaving for her job as a hair stylist, Ms. Fern, 38, said she told her babysitter not to go farther than the front lawn of their cul-de-sac on Wednesday, and to run inside, lock the doors and call 911 if she saw anything suspicious.\n\u201cJust that feeling that she could be lurking in the neighborhoods,\u201d Ms. Fern said of the threat. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of looking everywhere.\u201d\nIn Jefferson County, officials were making contingency plans to reopen schools, even if that meant overcoming logistical hurdles like changes in transportation and food service. \u201cWe did not wish to have one person hold all of the schools in the front range of the whole state hostage,\u201d said Jason Glass, the schools superintendent.\nMr. Glass said even though those plans had not been implemented and schools would open on Thursday, they would be saved for the future.\nMr. McDonald, the school safety director, said the system did not want to play into the fascination with Columbine. \u201cWe\u2019re not a place to come visit if you\u2019re not a student,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a tourist attraction. We\u2019re not a place for you to come and gain inspiration.\u201d",

Mueller III, will be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/the-mueller-report.html\">public on Thursday</a> in a nearly 400-page report. The treatise is likely to add significantly to our understanding of Russia&rsquo;s 2016 election interference and President Trump&rsquo;s efforts to control federal inquiries into the matter.</p>\n<p>Attorney General William P. Barr said last month that the special counsel did not find that anyone associated with the Trump campaign worked with the Russian government to illegally influence the election. He also said there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. But Americans have been eagerly waiting to hear from Mr. Mueller&rsquo;s investigators in their own words.</p>\n<p>Whether you have followed every step of the investigation or are tuning in after months of avoiding the headlines, here is a primer for the report&rsquo;s release.</p>\n<h2>When will the report come out?</h2>\n<p>Thursday morning, according to the Justice Department.</p>\n<h2>Where can I find it?</h2>\n<p>The Justice Department is expected to publish it on <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/sco\">the special counsel&rsquo;s website</a>. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a> will be offering live updates and analysis of the key findings, as will most likely every major news organization.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr will also hold a news conference at 9:30 a.m. Thursday to discuss the findings of the investigation, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. The department plans to turn the report over to Congress between 11 a.m. and noon on CDs, and it will be posted online sometime after, according to a senior department official.</p>\n<h2>What information will be redacted?</h2>\n<p>Mr. Barr has said that law enforcement officials are blacking out sensitive information and that the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/redacted-report.html?action=click&module=Intentional&pgtype=Article\">redactions</a> will be color-coded so we will know the reason behind each one. They will fall into four categories:</p>\n<p>1. Information that has been presented to a grand jury, which is subject to secrecy rules. This could conceivably cover a lot of material.</p>\n<p>2. Material that intelligence officials fear could compromise sensitive sources and methods. This would include information from F.B.I. informants and foreign allies.</p>\n<p>3. Information that could hamper other current investigations, including spinoffs of the Mueller inquiry. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan are investigating the finances of the Trump inaugural committee and hush payments intended to cover up a sex scandal that threatened to upend Mr. Trump&rsquo;s campaign.</p>\n<p>4. Material that the Justice Department believes would unfairly infringe on the privacy and damage the reputations of &ldquo;peripheral third parties.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2>Why the redactions?</h2>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s concerns are standard for prosecutors handling sensitive information. &ldquo;It is not like there is anything crazy on his list,&rdquo; said Mary McCord, who led the Justice Department&rsquo;s national security division from 2016 to 2017.</p>\n<p>Prosecutors are prohibited under a federal rule of criminal procedure from disclosing grand jury material. They also try not to jeopardize intelligence sources and methods that contribute to the nation&rsquo;s security.</p>\n<p>They want to keep current criminal inquiries as quiet as possible to maximize investigators&rsquo; leverage and to protect the reputations of people who may never be charged with a crime. And they try not to publicly identify witnesses or other peripheral figures for the same reason.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;These are well-established principles,&rdquo; Ms. McCord said. &ldquo;But it remains to be seen how broadly or narrowly Barr applies them. And of course because we won&rsquo;t know what has been redacted, we can&rsquo;t make much of a judgment about whether he has been too broad or not.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The only yardstick for the general public &mdash; a highly imperfect one &mdash; will be the percentage of the report that is hidden from view. &ldquo;If nine-tenths of the report is blacked out, I think we confidently can then say, &lsquo;Yes, that is too broad,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ms. McCord said.</p>\n<h2>What part of the report is likely to be most interesting?</h2>\n<p>Reporters are likely to make a beeline to the section of the report that addresses why Mr. Mueller decided not to draw a conclusion about whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, citing &ldquo;difficult issues&rdquo; of law and fact.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr resolved those issues, deciding that there was insufficient evidence that the president had committed a crime. The report should either bolster that finding or call it into question.</p>\n<p>Mr. Barr&rsquo;s brief summation of the report&rsquo;s main findings, released last month, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/us/politics/mueller-report-summary.html\">suggested</a> that prosecutors were unable to show that the president acted with &ldquo;corrupt intent&rdquo; to block the federal inquiry. The report is expected to address whether and why that was so. It may render some judgment on the president&rsquo;s refusal to be interviewed in person and whether that hampered prosecutors.</p>\n<p>Reporters will also zero in on what about the president&rsquo;s conduct raised the possibility he may have obstructed justice.

                "text": "Erin Schaff/The New York Times\nWASHINGTON \u2014 After 23 months, 500 search warrants, 2,300 subpoenas and a string of indictments, the results of the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will be public on Thursday in a nearly 400-page report. The treatise is likely to add significantly to our understanding of Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and President Trump\u2019s efforts to control federal inquiries into the matter.\nAttorney General William P. Barr said last month that the special counsel did not find that anyone associated with the Trump campaign worked with the Russian government to illegally influence the election. He also said there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump illegally obstructed justice. But Americans have been eagerly waiting to hear from Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators in their own words.\nWhether you have followed every step of the investigation or are tuning in after months of avoiding the headlines, here is a primer for the report\u2019s release.\nWhen will the report come out?\nThursday morning, according to the Justice Department.\nWhere can I find it?\nThe Justice Department is expected to publish it on the special counsel\u2019s website. The New York Times will be offering live updates and analysis of the key findings, as will most likely every major news organization.\nMr. Barr will also hold a news conference at 9:30 a.m. Thursday to discuss the findings of the investigation, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. The department plans to turn the report over to Congress between 11 a.m. and noon on CDs, and it will be posted online sometime after, according to a senior department official.\nWhat information will be redacted?\nMr. Barr has said that law enforcement officials are blacking out sensitive information and that the redactions will be color-coded so we will know the reason behind each one. They will fall into four categories:\n1. Information that has been presented to a grand jury, which is subject to secrecy rules. This could conceivably cover a lot of material.\n2. Material that intelligence officials fear could compromise sensitive sources and methods. This would include information from F.B.I. informants and foreign allies.\n3. Information that could hamper other current investigations, including spinoffs of the Mueller inquiry. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn and Manhattan are investigating the finances of the Trump inaugural committee and hush payments intended to cover up a sex scandal that threatened to upend Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n4. Material that the Justice Department believes would unfairly infringe on the privacy and damage the reputations of \u201cperipheral third parties.\u201d\nWhy the redactions?\nMr. Barr\u2019s concerns are standard for prosecutors handling sensitive information. \u201cIt is not like there is anything crazy on his list,\u201d said Mary McCord, who led the Justice Department\u2019s national security division from 2016 to 2017.\nProsecutors are prohibited under a federal rule of criminal procedure from disclosing grand jury material. They also try not to jeopardize intelligence sources and methods that contribute to the nation\u2019s security.\nThey want to keep current criminal inquiries as quiet as possible to maximize investigators\u2019 leverage and to protect the reputations of people who may never be charged with a crime. And they try not to publicly identify witnesses or other peripheral figures for the same reason.\n\u201cThese are well-established principles,\u201d Ms. McCord said. \u201cBut it remains to be seen how broadly or narrowly Barr applies them. And of course because we won\u2019t know what has been redacted, we can\u2019t make much of a judgment about whether he has been too broad or not.\u201d\nThe only yardstick for the general public \u2014 a highly imperfect one \u2014 will be the percentage of the report that is hidden from view. \u201cIf nine-tenths of the report is blacked out, I think we confidently can then say, \u2018Yes, that is too broad,\u2019\u201d Ms. McCord said.\nWhat part of the report is likely to be most interesting?\nReporters are likely to make a beeline to the section of the report that addresses why Mr. Mueller decided not to draw a conclusion about whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice, citing \u201cdifficult issues\u201d of law and fact.\nMr. Barr resolved those issues, deciding that there was insufficient evidence that the president had committed a crime. The report should either bolster that finding or call it into question.\nMr. Barr\u2019s brief summation of the report\u2019s main findings, released last month, suggested that prosecutors were unable to show that the president acted with \u201ccorrupt intent\u201d to block the federal inquiry. The report is expected to address whether and why that was so. It may render some judgment on the president\u2019s refusal to be interviewed in person and whether that hampered prosecutors.\nReporters will also zero in on what about the president\u2019s conduct raised the possibility he may have obstructed justice. Mr. Barr told Congress last month that \u201ca number of actions by the president\u201d prompted concerns, \u201cmost of which have been the subject of public reporting.\u201d\nMr. Barr\u2019s comment implied there were troubling actions that have not yet been revealed. Does the report detail them?\nWill we ever see the full report?\nWe don\u2019t know. The House Judiciary Committee has authorized a subpoena for the entire text of the report and the underlying evidence. The committee has not set a date to issue the subpoena. And Mr. Barr has said he is willing to consider whether he can share more information with the House and Senate Judiciary committees than he decided to release publicly.\nBut Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are unlikely to be satisfied with a briefing or partial release; it appears likely that Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the head of the committee, will issue the subpoena.\nWhether the committee would release whatever information it gets is unclear. The Justice Department would probably resist the public disclosure of information it has deemed confidential or classified, setting up a battle in court.\nIs this the final word on the 2016 election and its aftermath?\nFar from it. Even if much of the nation has moved on to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d this saga will continue.\nMr. Barr pledged to investigate the origins of the F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference, which Mr. Mueller took over in May 2017. Congressional Democrats want to scrutinize the decisions by the special counsel and the attorney general, as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s own behavior.\nMr. Barr has voluntarily agreed to explain his decisions to the House and Senate Judiciary committees in early May. The House committee is also likely to call Mr. Mueller to testify.\nHouse Democrats are busy with their own investigations into matters related to the Mueller inquiry, including whether the president abused his powers or obstructed justice and whether foreign governments exerted improper influence over Mr. Trump and his family.\nIn the Senate, the intelligence committee is still working on its own report that will address some of the same questions that the Mueller team investigated. Lawmakers may propose policy changes to protect American elections from future foreign interference.\nIn short, the cottage industry of investigators that has sprung up in the past two years expects to be busy until at least the next presidential election.",
