It has effects on everybody: increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Watch below:</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1117806283300777984\"><p>Rep. @AOC, who personally gave up Facebook, says &quot;social media poses a public health risk to everybody.&quot; &ldquo;I've sta&hellip; https://t.co/FY44V0XqJJ</p> &mdash; Yahoo News (@YahooNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YahooNews/statuses/1117806283300777984\">1555340760.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>She has a point.</p>\n<p>For some, the lure of Facebook evaporated when the site opened itself up to people other than college kids.</p>\n<p>Valid.</p>\n<p>AOC added that she supports a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/elizbeth-warrens-plan-to-break-up-big-tech-detailed.html\">break up large social media companies</a> like Facebook, which finagled a monopoly on the market through its ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the central parts of Warren&rsquo;s proposal is that these tech companies need to decide what they are. The fact that you are going to be both the platform and the vendor represents a very large antitrust problem,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And the fact that they are consolidating and gobbling up 18 different business models in to one is a huge issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This point too struck a nerve with people.</p>\n<p>AOC also criticized Twitter for allowing President Donald Trump to exploit its platform as a medium for harassing his political adversaries, like when Trump tweeted 9/11 footage to stir up anti-Muslim fervor against AOC's colleague, Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MI).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If a lot of people tweeted that, perhaps Twitter would&rsquo;ve taken the tweet down as targeted harassment. But perhaps they don&rsquo;t want to show their hand,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because they could single-handedly cut the president&rsquo;s power by 30 to 50 percent overnight if they banned President Trump from the platform. That&rsquo;s his bully pulpit.&rdquo;</p>",

It has effects on everybody: increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.\u201d\nWatch below:\nRep. @AOC, who personally gave up Facebook, says \"social media poses a public health risk to everybody.\" \u201cI've sta\u2026 https://t.co/FY44V0XqJJ\n\u2014 Yahoo News (@YahooNews) 1555340760.0\nShe has a point.\nFor some, the lure of Facebook evaporated when the site opened itself up to people other than college kids.\nValid.\nAOC added that she supports a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to break up large social media companies like Facebook, which finagled a monopoly on the market through its ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\u201cOne of the central parts of Warren\u2019s proposal is that these tech companies need to decide what they are. The fact that you are going to be both the platform and the vendor represents a very large antitrust problem,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the fact that they are consolidating and gobbling up 18 different business models in to one is a huge issue.\u201d\nThis point too struck a nerve with people.\nAOC also criticized Twitter for allowing President Donald Trump to exploit its platform as a medium for harassing his political adversaries, like when Trump tweeted 9/11 footage to stir up anti-Muslim fervor against AOC's colleague, Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MI).\n\u201cIf a lot of people tweeted that, perhaps Twitter would\u2019ve taken the tweet down as targeted harassment. But perhaps they don\u2019t want to show their hand,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they could single-handedly cut the president\u2019s power by 30 to 50 percent overnight if they banned President Trump from the platform. That\u2019s his bully pulpit.\u201d",

On the day O'Rourke officially put his hat into the ring, his campaign raised a whopping $6.1 million.\nBeto O'Rourke seems like he's larger than life, and one guy took that to the next level. Artist Stan Herd created a crop circle in honor of the former Congressman's campaign, and it really does look like him.\nThe giant image of O'Rourke's face is inside a circle says \"Beto 2020.\"\nThe artist behind the #BETO2020 artwork is Stan Herd.

Herd's artwork is located about a mile and a half from the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport \"so that we kind of guarantee a captured audience coming in.\"\n\"Stan was in the field for hours a day,\" says John Zarr, a project manager who assisted Herd. The project took about two weeks and cost more than $10,000, but it's worth it to Herd and Zarr, who asks \"Why not let your voice be heard?\"\nMake sure your flight goes through Austin: the piece will be visible for about two weeks and can be seen from the sky.",

That is not fair, that's not the American way, and we shouldn't be doing it.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>The backlash was swift.</p>\n<p>Many were quick to point out one of the more glaring falsehoods in Pavlich's words.</p>\n<p>The United States was far from the first country to abolish slavery.</p>\n<p>Some also pointed out the ways in which the prison system in the United States rumbles with <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/142340-5-ways-the-us-prison-industrial-complex-mimics-slavery\">echoes of slavery</a>.</p>\n<p>Yikes.</p>",

America came along as the first country to end it within 150 years. And we get no credit for that.\u201d\nWatch below:\nKatie Pavlich on Fox News only barely paraphrased: \u201cIt\u2019s not like we still enslave people.

That is not fair, that's not the American way, and we shouldn't be doing it.\"\nThe backlash was swift.\nMany were quick to point out one of the more glaring falsehoods in Pavlich's words.\nThe United States was far from the first country to abolish slavery.\nSome also pointed out the ways in which the prison system in the United States rumbles with echoes of slavery.\nYikes.",

The petition calls for university officials to rescind the invitation:</p>\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration&rsquo;s policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Speaking to <em>Newsweek</em>, Hoekstra <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/mike-pence-taylor-university-commencement-address-backlash-1393490\">said</a> that he is not alone in feeling &quot;personally injured&quot; by Pence and the current administration:</p>\n<blockquote>&ldquo;As an alumni of Taylor and as a gay man I&rsquo;m pretty personally injured by the policies of the Trump/Pence administration and I know that a lot of alumni who identify as other minority groups are personally affected by the Trump/Pence administration.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Others have taken to social media to criticize the university's decision.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1116412509605572610\"><p>Count me as part of The Backlash. @tayloru, this is a mistake, to ally yourself with and honor a politician who has&hellip; https://t.co/3qOmMkPk0e</p> &mdash; Joanna (@keepingfeet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keepingfeet/statuses/1116412509605572610\">1555008458.0</a></blockquote>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1116475038671286276\"><p>Mike Pence was invited to speak at my alma mater.

It reads like a deliberate and definitive statement about who we are and about what we think virtue in the public sphere looks like &mdash; and, by implication, who doesn&rsquo;t belong...<p>As soon as the announcement was made, a professor from the biblical studies, Christian ministries and philosophy department called for a vote of dissent. After some discussion, during which some faculty expressed support for Pence&rsquo;s presence, comparing him to the biblical figure of Daniel, and others critiqued the decision, 49 faculty voted in favor of Pence addressing the community at commencement. Sixty-one voted in opposition.&quot;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Taylor University is not budging, according to James Garringer, a spokesman for the university:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence&rsquo;s upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue. We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The university's refusal to rescind the invitation was praised by Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumni.</p>\n<p>I was very nervous initially that the very vocal overwhelming minority might sort of sway Taylor to take a different stance so I'm very glad they're taking that solid stance,&quot; Holtsberry <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/pence-taylor-university-commencement\">said</a> during an appearance on &quot;Fox and Friends.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe,&quot; he continued. &quot;His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion.&quot;</p>\n<p>This isn't the first time Pence has been at the center of a controversy on a university campus.</p>\n<p>In May 2017, a group of more than 100 graduating seniors at the University of Notre Dame walked out of their own graduation ceremony in protest of Pence, who delivered their commencement address there that morning.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"866333713738731520\"><p>Notre Dame students walk out of Mike Pence's commencement speech over policies including LGBT rights. https://t.co/BMt6vUnfNZ</p> &mdash; Greg Hogben (@MyDaughtersArmy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MyDaughtersArmy/statuses/866333713738731520\">1495385027.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>A student activist group called We Stand For staged the walkout in response to policies Pence pursued as governor of Indiana that they say targeted the most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We invite all students, faculty, and families who will be attending the Commencement ceremony to walk out with us as we take back our graduation and show our dissatisfaction with the University&rsquo;s selection of Mike Pence as honored speaker,&rdquo; the group <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/notre-dame-students-walk-mike-pence-commencement-speech/story?id=47545854\">wrote</a> at the time. &ldquo;We also will walk out in dignity and solidarity with all marginalized people affected by Pence&rsquo;s politics, both on this campus and throughout our nation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Pence has proven a most divisive figure on both sides of the political aisle. Although Donald Trump gained favor from the right when he picked the evangelical Indiana Governor as his vice presidential running mate, his choice received vigorous denunciations from the left.</p>\n<p>A former GOP leader who served in the chamber for nearly a decade, Pence fulfilled Trump&rsquo;s need for someone who could work closely with the executive branch. Pence&rsquo;s record for social conservatism has drawn harsh condemnation from LGBT and abortion rights advocates.</p>\n<p>As governor of Indiana, Pence approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a measure allowing businesses to discriminate against consumers based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. A fierce backlash from business and the tourist industry, along with a <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/boycott-indiana-companies/\">trending hashtag #BoycottIndiana</a>, forced the governor and state legislatures there to add an amendment clarifying that nothing in the law was intended to permit discrimination.</p>\n<p>In 2006, as head of the Republican Study Committee, Pence voiced his opposition to same-sex marriage legislation when he <a href=\"http://time.com/4406337/mike-pence-gay-rights-lgbt-religious-freedom/\">declared</a> &ldquo;societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Similarly, Pence has also <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/social/first-amendment-defense-act/\">pledged his support</a> for the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which would prohibit &ldquo;the federal government from taking discriminatory action against a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that: (1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.&rdquo; FADA would also eliminate federal remedies for discrimination and allow those committing discriminatory acts to sue the federal government for interfering in their &ldquo;right&rdquo; to discriminate against LGBTs.</p>",

                "text": "Taylor University, a small evangelical Christian college in Vice President Mike Pence's home state of Indiana, faces criticism from students, alumni, and faculty who've voiced their opposition to the university's selection of Pence to deliver the 2019 commencement address.\nTaylor University is honored to have Vice President Mike Pence featured as our commencement speaker. Mr. Pence has\u2026 https://t.co/aSHLFHZVpT\n\u2014 Taylor University (@tayloru) 1555003053.0\nA Change.org petition started by 2007 Taylor graduate Alex Hoekstra after the school made the announcement on April 11 has garnered over 3,500 signatures. The petition calls for university officials to rescind the invitation:\n\u201cInviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration\u2019s policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.\"\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Hoekstra said that he is not alone in feeling \"personally injured\" by Pence and the current administration:\n\u201cAs an alumni of Taylor and as a gay man I\u2019m pretty personally injured by the policies of the Trump/Pence administration and I know that a lot of alumni who identify as other minority groups are personally affected by the Trump/Pence administration.\"\nOthers have taken to social media to criticize the university's decision.\nCount me as part of The Backlash. @tayloru, this is a mistake, to ally yourself with and honor a politician who has\u2026 https://t.co/3qOmMkPk0e\n\u2014 Joanna (@keepingfeet) 1555008458.0\nMike Pence was invited to speak at my alma mater.

Pence is a key part of the Trump admin th\u2026 https://t.co/YHm2v39lXp\n\u2014 Ed Cyzewski (@edcyzewski) 1554995082.0\nIn an op-ed for The Washington Post, adjunct faculty member Amy Peterson also criticized the decision:\n\u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t reassure those with underrepresented voices that they can flourish at Taylor; it leaves them feeling isolated and invisible. It reads like a deliberate and definitive statement about who we are and about what we think virtue in the public sphere looks like \u2014 and, by implication, who doesn\u2019t belong...\nAs soon as the announcement was made, a professor from the biblical studies, Christian ministries and philosophy department called for a vote of dissent. After some discussion, during which some faculty expressed support for Pence\u2019s presence, comparing him to the biblical figure of Daniel, and others critiqued the decision, 49 faculty voted in favor of Pence addressing the community at commencement. Sixty-one voted in opposition.\"\nTaylor University is not budging, according to James Garringer, a spokesman for the university:\n\u201cSince making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue. We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month.\u201d\nThe university's refusal to rescind the invitation was praised by Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumni.\nI was very nervous initially that the very vocal overwhelming minority might sort of sway Taylor to take a different stance so I'm very glad they're taking that solid stance,\" Holtsberry said during an appearance on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\"The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe,\" he continued. \"His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion.\"\nThis isn't the first time Pence has been at the center of a controversy on a university campus.\nIn May 2017, a group of more than 100 graduating seniors at the University of Notre Dame walked out of their own graduation ceremony in protest of Pence, who delivered their commencement address there that morning.\nNotre Dame students walk out of Mike Pence's commencement speech over policies including LGBT rights. https://t.co/BMt6vUnfNZ\n\u2014 Greg Hogben (@MyDaughtersArmy) 1495385027.0\nA student activist group called We Stand For staged the walkout in response to policies Pence pursued as governor of Indiana that they say targeted the most vulnerable.\n\u201cWe invite all students, faculty, and families who will be attending the Commencement ceremony to walk out with us as we take back our graduation and show our dissatisfaction with the University\u2019s selection of Mike Pence as honored speaker,\u201d the group wrote at the time. \u201cWe also will walk out in dignity and solidarity with all marginalized people affected by Pence\u2019s politics, both on this campus and throughout our nation.\u201d\nPence has proven a most divisive figure on both sides of the political aisle. Although Donald Trump gained favor from the right when he picked the evangelical Indiana Governor as his vice presidential running mate, his choice received vigorous denunciations from the left.\nA former GOP leader who served in the chamber for nearly a decade, Pence fulfilled Trump\u2019s need for someone who could work closely with the executive branch. Pence\u2019s record for social conservatism has drawn harsh condemnation from LGBT and abortion rights advocates.\nAs governor of Indiana, Pence approved the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a measure allowing businesses to discriminate against consumers based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. A fierce backlash from business and the tourist industry, along with a trending hashtag #BoycottIndiana, forced the governor and state legislatures there to add an amendment clarifying that nothing in the law was intended to permit discrimination.\nIn 2006, as head of the Republican Study Committee, Pence voiced his opposition to same-sex marriage legislation when he declared \u201csocietal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family.\u201d\nSimilarly, Pence has also pledged his support for the First Amendment Defense Act (FADA), which would prohibit \u201cthe federal government from taking discriminatory action against a person on the basis that such person believes or acts in accordance with a religious belief or moral conviction that: (1) marriage is or should be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or (2) sexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage.\u201d FADA would also eliminate federal remedies for discrimination and allow those committing discriminatory acts to sue the federal government for interfering in their \u201cright\u201d to discriminate against LGBTs.",

But prior to then rumors of a run for the White House abounded on social media based on the New York businessman's own social media accounts.</p>\n<p>During his announcement, Trump referenced the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; nostalgia for a United States that never really existed in his speech. The MAGA rallies continued well after the election in November 2016.</p>\n<p>The &quot;America First&quot; rhetoric and <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/politics/sarah-sanders-trump-condemns-violence/\">targeting of the press</a>, political opponents and other Trump critics during the rallies drew criticism since the beginning of Trump's campaign. And those sentiments spawned at least one violent fan in the form of <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/politics/cesar-sayoc-attending-pro-trump-rally-cincinatti-ohio-2016/\">the MAGA bomber</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/politics/cesar-sayoc-twitter-trump-bombs/\">Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr. sent pipe bombs</a> to the people the President targeted on Twitter and in his rallies.</p>\n<p>SPLC noted a 30 percent increase in hate groups since 2015. 2018 saw a 7 percent increase.</p>\n<p>1,020 organizations earned a hate group designation in 2018, a 20 year high.</p>\n<p>In addition to President Trump, SPLC also cited the rest of the Trump administration, right-wing media outlets and the ease which social media platforms facilitate the spread of hate. In their annual report, SPLC stated the root cause is:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;...hysteria over losing a white-majority nation to demographic change.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>The President has been accused of fomenting and feeding on those fears to gain votes and popularity during the election and since. Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said in a statement:</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;The numbers tell a striking story&mdash;that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>Beirich also indicated the President's tactics lead to the rise in public displays of bigotry and hate crimes.</p>\n<blockquote>&quot;Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it&mdash;with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to to act on their worst instincts.&quot;</blockquote>\n<p>According to SPLC, the majority of hate groups in the United States&mdash;neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, racist skinheads and neo-Confederates&mdash;employ white supremacist ideology. And unlike other hate groups, which are also on the rise, these groups enjoy political support and influence among local, state and federal governments.</p>\n<p>SPLC defines hate groups as:</p>\n<p>&quot;...based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities &mdash; has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people typically for their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.&quot;</p>\n<p>Few people were surprised by the rise, based on their own observations and experiences.</p>\n<p>And their assessment of who was to blame was the same as well.</p>\n<p>Although not all things resulting from the current political climate can be viewed as negative. A record number of women and the most diverse group ever convened in Washington DC for the 116th Congress.</p>",

                "text": "For the fourth year in a row, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) reported a rise in \"hate and domestic extremism.\" To what does the civil rights group attribute the increase?\nPresident Donald Trump who has his own complicated history with bigotry.\nBut how can the President be responsible for a four year rise when he only assumed office in January of 2017?\nDonald Trump formally announced his presidential candidacy in June of 2015. But prior to then rumors of a run for the White House abounded on social media based on the New York businessman's own social media accounts.\nDuring his announcement, Trump referenced the anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and \"Make America Great Again\" nostalgia for a United States that never really existed in his speech. The MAGA rallies continued well after the election in November 2016.\nThe \"America First\" rhetoric and targeting of the press, political opponents and other Trump critics during the rallies drew criticism since the beginning of Trump's campaign. And those sentiments spawned at least one violent fan in the form of the MAGA bomber.\nCesar Altieri Sayoc Jr. sent pipe bombs to the people the President targeted on Twitter and in his rallies.\nSPLC noted a 30 percent increase in hate groups since 2015. 2018 saw a 7 percent increase.\n1,020 organizations earned a hate group designation in 2018, a 20 year high.\nIn addition to President Trump, SPLC also cited the rest of the Trump administration, right-wing media outlets and the ease which social media platforms facilitate the spread of hate. In their annual report, SPLC stated the root cause is:\n\"...hysteria over losing a white-majority nation to demographic change.\"\nThe President has been accused of fomenting and feeding on those fears to gain votes and popularity during the election and since. Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project, said in a statement:\n\"The numbers tell a striking story\u2014that this president is not simply a polarizing figure but a radicalizing one.\"\nBeirich also indicated the President's tactics lead to the rise in public displays of bigotry and hate crimes.\n\"Rather than trying to tamp down hate, as presidents of both parties have done, President Trump elevates it\u2014with both his rhetoric and his policies. In doing so, he's given people across America the go-ahead to to act on their worst instincts.\"\nAccording to SPLC, the majority of hate groups in the United States\u2014neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, racist skinheads and neo-Confederates\u2014employ white supremacist ideology. And unlike other hate groups, which are also on the rise, these groups enjoy political support and influence among local, state and federal governments.\nSPLC defines hate groups as:\n\"...based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities \u2014 has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people typically for their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\nFew people were surprised by the rise, based on their own observations and experiences.\nAnd their assessment of who was to blame was the same as well.\nAlthough not all things resulting from the current political climate can be viewed as negative. A record number of women and the most diverse group ever convened in Washington DC for the 116th Congress.",

Consovoy and Stefan Passantino put Mazars &quot;on notice&quot;&mdash;implying legal action should the firm comply with the subpoena.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is no secret that the Democrat Party has decided to use its new House majority to launch a flood of investigations into the president&rsquo;s personal affairs in hopes of using anything they can find to damage him politically,&quot; lawyers for the president wrote to Jerry D. Bernstein, Mazar's counsel.</p>\n<p>Trump's attorneys accused Cummings and Congressional Democrats of mounting a political attack on their client, going so far as to peddle a false narrative about the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Democrats&rsquo; fervor has only intensified after the special counsel squelched their &lsquo;Russia collusion&rsquo; narrative,&rdquo; Consovoy and Passantino claimed.</p>\n<p>The attorneys also argued that Congress lacks the authority to demand Trump's financials.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The House Oversight Committee is not a miniature Department of Justice, charged with investigating and prosecuting potential federal crimes,&quot; they said. &quot;It is a legislative body, not &lsquo;a law enforcement or trial agency,&rsquo; and the chairman&rsquo;s attempt to assume for Congress the role of police, prosecutor, and judge is unconstitutional.&quot;</p>\n<p>All this points to one thing: Trump is petrified of the public getting a glimpse of his finances.</p>\n<p>Trump's legal time is encouraging witnesses to break the law.</p>\n<p>The whole thing stinks of witness tampering and obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p>And Republicans are letting him get away with it. Cummings' Republican counterpart on the Oversight, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, called Cummings' subpoena a &quot;gravely dangerous&quot; abuse of power.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I strongly object to Chairman Cummings&rsquo; unprecedented subpoena to Mazars and his irresponsible and gravely dangerous course of conduct in a singular obsession of attacking President Trump and his family for political gain,&rdquo; Jordan said.</p>\n<p>Cummings was not having it. Congressional subpoenas &quot;are key to the committee&rsquo;s ongoing investigations of matters squarely within our jurisdiction,&rdquo; Cummings replied, referring to Trump's perceived conflicts of interests.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Jordan is embarking on an unprecedented path of partisanship that all members of the House of Representatives should find concerning,&quot; Cummings wrote, &quot;because it could have a detrimental impact on Congress&rsquo; ability to exercise its core constitutional oversight responsibilities for years to come.&quot;</p>",

                "text": "President Donald Trump's attorneys are urging a financial firm to ignore a Congressional subpoena demanding the president's financial records, Politico reported on Monday.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) issued a subpoena to accounting conglomerate Mazars USA, which is in possession of Trump's coveted tax documents.\nThe subpoena seeks to confirm testimony by Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who alleged that Trump over and under-inflated the value of his assets.\nAccording to Politico, attorneys William S. Consovoy and Stefan Passantino put Mazars \"on notice\"\u2014implying legal action should the firm comply with the subpoena.\n\u201cIt is no secret that the Democrat Party has decided to use its new House majority to launch a flood of investigations into the president\u2019s personal affairs in hopes of using anything they can find to damage him politically,\" lawyers for the president wrote to Jerry D. Bernstein, Mazar's counsel.\nTrump's attorneys accused Cummings and Congressional Democrats of mounting a political attack on their client, going so far as to peddle a false narrative about the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian election interference.\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 fervor has only intensified after the special counsel squelched their \u2018Russia collusion\u2019 narrative,\u201d Consovoy and Passantino claimed.\nThe attorneys also argued that Congress lacks the authority to demand Trump's financials.\n\u201cThe House Oversight Committee is not a miniature Department of Justice, charged with investigating and prosecuting potential federal crimes,\" they said. \"It is a legislative body, not \u2018a law enforcement or trial agency,\u2019 and the chairman\u2019s attempt to assume for Congress the role of police, prosecutor, and judge is unconstitutional.\"\nAll this points to one thing: Trump is petrified of the public getting a glimpse of his finances.\nTrump's legal time is encouraging witnesses to break the law.\nThe whole thing stinks of witness tampering and obstruction of justice.\nAnd Republicans are letting him get away with it. Cummings' Republican counterpart on the Oversight, Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, called Cummings' subpoena a \"gravely dangerous\" abuse of power.\n\u201cI strongly object to Chairman Cummings\u2019 unprecedented subpoena to Mazars and his irresponsible and gravely dangerous course of conduct in a singular obsession of attacking President Trump and his family for political gain,\u201d Jordan said.\nCummings was not having it. Congressional subpoenas \"are key to the committee\u2019s ongoing investigations of matters squarely within our jurisdiction,\u201d Cummings replied, referring to Trump's perceived conflicts of interests.\n\u201cJordan is embarking on an unprecedented path of partisanship that all members of the House of Representatives should find concerning,\" Cummings wrote, \"because it could have a detrimental impact on Congress\u2019 ability to exercise its core constitutional oversight responsibilities for years to come.\"",

The president, according to a <em>New Yorker</em> <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/03/11/the-making-of-the-fox-news-white-house\">report</a> published last month, ranks Fox News hosts based on their loyalty to him. Trump uses a scale of 1 to 10.</p>\n<p>The report confirms so many of Trump's critics' worst fears: That there appears to be no end to the depths of the notoriously thin-skinned president&rsquo;s narcissism, to which the American public so often has a front row seat.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, it wasn&rsquo;t Trump acolyte Sean Hannity who received the highest score. Although the president gave Hannity a perfect score of 10, he believes Steve Doocy, the co-host of &ldquo;Fox &amp; Friends,&rdquo; is so devoted to him that Doocy&rsquo;s earned a score of 12.</p>\n<p>Doocy doesn&rsquo;t rank anywhere near as high among Republican consumers, according to a November 2018 Morning Consult poll that ranked the favorability of Fox News hosts. Doocy&rsquo;s near the bottom; Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Ainsley Earhardt have the top three spots. Hannity just misses the top five. And although Trump isn&rsquo;t as enamored with Brett Baier, the moderator for Sanders' town hall whom he rated a 6 out 10, Baier is still among the top 10 Fox News hosts according to this survey.</p>\n<p>Baier&ndash;&ndash;and by extension, the entire Fox News network&ndash;&ndash;undoubtedly took a hit when during the town hall, Baier asked if they&rsquo;d be &ldquo;willing to transition to a government-run system,&rdquo; signaling support for Medicare for All.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here,&rdquo; Baier said. &ldquo;A show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance right now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Most audience members raised their hands.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Now of those, how many are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?&rdquo; Baier asked.</p>\n<p>The same amount of people raised their hands. Many cheered loudly, much to Baier&rsquo;s surprise.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1117924843746361345\"><p>Bret Baier just polled the Bernie Town Hall audience who would be willing to switch to #MedicareForAll. It backfire&hellip; https://t.co/A8bNPM12hR</p> &mdash; jordan (@JordanUhl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/statuses/1117924843746361345\">1555369027.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s 180 million people on private insurance, and they would be lost, right?&rdquo; Baier continued.</p>\n<p>To that, Sanders replied:</p>\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Fair question. I know it&rsquo;s what the right wing throws out, so let me answer it, all right? Millions of people every single year lose their health insurance, you know why? They get fired or they quit and they go to another employer. I was a mayor for eight years and you know what I did, what probably every mayor in America does, is you look around for the best insurance program, the most cost-effective insurance. You change insurance. Every year, millions of workers wake up in the morning and their employer has changed the insurance that they have. Maybe they liked the doctors, some people are nodding their heads, OK. So this is not new, every year. Now what we&rsquo;re talking about actually is stability. That when you have a &lsquo;Medicare for All&rsquo; it is there now and will be there in the future.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>The audience cheered again.</p>\n<blockquote data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1117926775772856325\"><p>Raise your hand if you're sick and tired of your private health insurance company. We need Medicare for All.&hellip; https://t.co/FmWgRKTpqQ</p> &mdash; Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/statuses/1117926775772856325\">1555369488.0</a></blockquote>\n<p>Baier and other Fox News personalities have denounced Medicare for All proposals as a &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; attempt to usurp a capitalist structure and abolish all private insurance. But several polls, including one <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/412552-majority-of-republicans-say-the-support-medicare-for-all-poll\">conducted by The Hill</a> in October 2018, show that the majority of Americans support Medicare for All. A similar poll conducted in January 2019 showed that 56 percent of American voters support such a system. And the footage from the town hall only accentuates what many already know: That the United States is ready for a change.</p>",

Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the \u201caudience\u201d was so smiley and nice.\u2026 https://t.co/MsOz4iMVNi\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 1555423906.0\nBut it was the use of the word \"we\" indicating a symbiotic relationship between the president and his preferred network\u2014one that has often been accused of ignoring crucial news items while currying favor with the president\u2014that riled Trump's critics.\n@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BretBaier @donnabrazile Did you just say \"now we have\"? We all know Fox is basically st\u2026 https://t.co/UHyQehyeul\n\u2014 Cathleen Burke (@ItsMeCathi) 1555438844.0\n@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BretBaier @donnabrazile You talk like Fox News belongs to you. Yes Fox News has become a\u2026 https://t.co/SybfATAtOp\n\u2014 James Agbormbai (@AgbormbaiJames) 1555440851.0\n@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BretBaier @donnabrazile @realDonaldTrump What's \"strange\" is your use of the word \"we\" w\u2026 https://t.co/pHr95TfkGR\n\u2014 Chris Suglia (@ChrisSuglia) 1555442801.0\n@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @BretBaier @donnabrazile So what is it then? Is Fox News \u201cfair and balanced\u201d or would you\u2026 https://t.co/5bHpEE9ABP\n\u2014 evil4life (@evil4life101) 1555440312.0\nTrump\u2019s adulation for Fox News is common knowledge at this point, but even his preferred network isn\u2019t immune from his rages and peculiarities. The president, according to a New Yorker report published last month, ranks Fox News hosts based on their loyalty to him. Trump uses a scale of 1 to 10.\nThe report confirms so many of Trump's critics' worst fears: That there appears to be no end to the depths of the notoriously thin-skinned president\u2019s narcissism, to which the American public so often has a front row seat.\nSurprisingly, it wasn\u2019t Trump acolyte Sean Hannity who received the highest score. Although the president gave Hannity a perfect score of 10, he believes Steve Doocy, the co-host of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d is so devoted to him that Doocy\u2019s earned a score of 12.\nDoocy doesn\u2019t rank anywhere near as high among Republican consumers, according to a November 2018 Morning Consult poll that ranked the favorability of Fox News hosts. Doocy\u2019s near the bottom; Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Ainsley Earhardt have the top three spots. Hannity just misses the top five. And although Trump isn\u2019t as enamored with Brett Baier, the moderator for Sanders' town hall whom he rated a 6 out 10, Baier is still among the top 10 Fox News hosts according to this survey.\nBaier\u2013\u2013and by extension, the entire Fox News network\u2013\u2013undoubtedly took a hit when during the town hall, Baier asked if they\u2019d be \u201cwilling to transition to a government-run system,\u201d signaling support for Medicare for All.\n\u201cI want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here,\u201d Baier said. \u201cA show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance right now.\u201d\nMost audience members raised their hands.\n\u201cNow of those, how many are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?\u201d Baier asked.\nThe same amount of people raised their hands. Many cheered loudly, much to Baier\u2019s surprise.\nBret Baier just polled the Bernie Town Hall audience who would be willing to switch to #MedicareForAll. It backfire\u2026 https://t.co/A8bNPM12hR\n\u2014 jordan (@JordanUhl) 1555369027.0\n\u201cThere\u2019s 180 million people on private insurance, and they would be lost, right?\u201d Baier continued.\nTo that, Sanders replied:\n\u201cFair question. I know it\u2019s what the right wing throws out, so let me answer it, all right? Millions of people every single year lose their health insurance, you know why? They get fired or they quit and they go to another employer. I was a mayor for eight years and you know what I did, what probably every mayor in America does, is you look around for the best insurance program, the most cost-effective insurance. You change insurance. Every year, millions of workers wake up in the morning and their employer has changed the insurance that they have. Maybe they liked the doctors, some people are nodding their heads, OK. So this is not new, every year. Now what we\u2019re talking about actually is stability. That when you have a \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 it is there now and will be there in the future.\u201d\nThe audience cheered again.\nRaise your hand if you're sick and tired of your private health insurance company. We need Medicare for All.\u2026 https://t.co/FmWgRKTpqQ\n\u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) 1555369488.0\nBaier and other Fox News personalities have denounced Medicare for All proposals as a \u201csocialist\u201d attempt to usurp a capitalist structure and abolish all private insurance. But several polls, including one conducted by The Hill in October 2018, show that the majority of Americans support Medicare for All. A similar poll conducted in January 2019 showed that 56 percent of American voters support such a system. And the footage from the town hall only accentuates what many already know: That the United States is ready for a change.",

Last year's dinner <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michelle-wolf-calls-white-house-correspondents-association-cowards-for-cutting-comedian-from-2019-dinner/\">included</a> comedian Michelle Wolf, whose jokes pointedly mocked Trump and his administration, including attendee Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/white-house-correspondents-statement-michelle-wolf/\">Wolf</a> also took shots at the White House press corps themselves, calling them out for profiting from their <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/kellyanne-conway-why-is-everybody-so-obsessed-with-the-president/\">obsessive</a> coverage of the President. &quot;He has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV,&quot; Wolf <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/29/politics/michelle-wolf-whcd-takeaways/index.html\">said</a>. &quot;You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.&quot;</p>\n<p>Trump suggested last year that he might attend this year's White House Correspondents' Dinner if it doesn't include a comedian.</p>\n<p>This year's dinner is bucking tradition by featuring a historian rather than a comedian, but Trump's still going to skip it. Instead, he'll be <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/george-conway-trump-health-windmills-cancer/\">holding</a> his rally in Green Bay, WI - one of the key states Trump credits with his election results.</p>\n<p>Trump's rallies are often used to insult the <a href=\"https://thesocialedgen.wpengine.com/news/world-freedom-report-2019/\">press</a>. He's repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-to-skip-white-house-correspondents-dinner-for-campaign-rally-in-wisconsin/\">referred</a> to the press as the &quot;enemy of the people&quot; and claiming they print &quot;fake news.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 2018, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/business/media/trump-retaliation-reporters-april-ryan.html\">threatened</a> to revoke the credentials of White House reporters if they didn't &quot;treat the White House with respect.&quot;</p>\n<p>At another rally, earlier that same year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/10/19/trump-encourages-violence-against-reporters-and-his-supporters-cheer/?utm_term=.2d7f1773633b\">praised</a> Rep.

                "text": "Donald Trump is taking a shot at the press again, this time by scheduling a MAGA rally the same night as the White House Correspondents' Dinner for the third year in a row.\nThe White House Correspondents' Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the United States. It's been a tradition since 1921, and\u2014until Trump's presidency\u2014was usually attended by the President and the Vice President.\nTrump vowed earlier this month to skip the dinner and hold a rally.\n\"We're going to hold a very positive rally,\" Trump said, describing the Correspondents' Dinner as \"boring and negative.\"\n\"Everybody wants it. It\u2019ll be a big one, but the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner is too negative. I like positive things. Okay?\"\nPresident Trump: \"I'm going to hold a rally yeah because the dinner is so boring and so negative that we're going t\u2026 https://t.co/g6uhf2MvzT\n\u2014 The Hill (@thehill) 1554582780.0\nNow, Trump's reelection campaign has announced that the rally will be held in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nHolding the rally the same day as the White House Correspondents' Dinner is a two-part snub: not only is Trump openly bucking a decades-old tradition, he's creating a situation in which many members of the press corps being honored at the dinner will have to skip it in order to cover the rally.\nThis is the third year in a row Trump has skipped the dinner, which often features a \"roast\" of the president and his administration. Last year's dinner included comedian Michelle Wolf, whose jokes pointedly mocked Trump and his administration, including attendee Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\nWolf also took shots at the White House press corps themselves, calling them out for profiting from their obsessive coverage of the President. \"He has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV,\" Wolf said. \"You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.\"\nTrump suggested last year that he might attend this year's White House Correspondents' Dinner if it doesn't include a comedian.\nThis year's dinner is bucking tradition by featuring a historian rather than a comedian, but Trump's still going to skip it. Instead, he'll be holding his rally in Green Bay, WI - one of the key states Trump credits with his election results.\nTrump's rallies are often used to insult the press. He's repeatedly referred to the press as the \"enemy of the people\" and claiming they print \"fake news.\"\nIn 2018, Trump threatened to revoke the credentials of White House reporters if they didn't \"treat the White House with respect.\"\nAt another rally, earlier that same year, Trump praised Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.) for assaulting a reporter, saying \"Any guy that can do a body slam, he\u2019s my kind of \u2014 he\u2019s my guy.\"\nAnd at a Texas rally in February of this year, a BBC cameraman was shoved by a Trump supporter shouting \"f--- the media.\"\n\"President Trump looks forward to sharing the successes of his administration with the great people of Wisconsin,\" said Trump campaign CEO Michael Glassner.\nSharing the successes of the press corps is apparently too much to ask.",

Jack Reed (D-CT) unveiled a <a href=\"https://www.reed.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Milcon%20Wall%20Project.pdf\">list</a> of military projects Trump may steal from to pay for his border wall, including more than millions of dollars from military bases in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina. Each of those states has a Republican senator running for re-election in 2020, and yet they still voted to let Trump rob military families in their own backyard.</p>\n<p>After Trump failed in his efforts to get Congress to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, he <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/red-state-newspapers-blast-trump-fake-national-emergency/\">made up</a> a fake national emergency at the southern border. In doing so, he planned to steal money from military projects, defying the will of Congress and possibly the Constitution.</p>\n<p>Congress had the opportunity to block Trump's fake emergency, but the majority of Republicans in both the <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/national-emergency-republicans-choose-trump-over-constitution/\">House</a> and <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/senate-humiliates-trump-repeal-fake-national-emergency/\">Senate</a> opted to side with Trump and abandon their loyalty to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>In Arizona, Sen. <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/martha-mcsally-failed-republican-senate-candidate-appointed/\">Martha McSally</a> was one of those who picked Trump, voting to allow him to swipe up to <a href=\"http://ktar.com/story/2491399/6-arizona-military-projects-including-2-at-luke-could-lose-funding-to-wall/\">$150 million</a> from military bases in her state. McSally risked funding for five projects at four locations, including $40 million for two F-35 related projects at Luke Air Force Base.</p>\n<p>Just last month, McSally <a href=\"http://ktar.com/story/2491399/6-arizona-military-projects-including-2-at-luke-could-lose-funding-to-wall/\">bragged</a> to a local radio station that she has &quot;fought for Luke Air Force Base.&quot; But when Trump demanded that McSally prove <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/trump-gop-fake-emergency-constitutionality-border-wall/\">her loyalty</a> to him, she promptly gave up that fight in order to do Trump's bidding.</p>\n<p>In Colorado, embattled Sen. Cory Gardner <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/cory-gardner-regret-denver-post-fake-emergency/\">rankled</a> past supporters by siding with Trump on the fake national emergency. With his vote, Gardner may have cost Fort Carson <a href=\"https://gazette.com/military/was-promise-to-sen-gardner-broken-trump-border-wall-could/article_5043a7aa-49c2-11e9-8436-a78581916f88.html\">$77 million</a> desperately needed for upgrades. The money was intended to &quot;provide troops with a long-awaited, improved vehicle maintenance shop to repair the post's aging fleet of trucks, tanks and Humvees.&quot;</p>\n<p>Instead, Gardner wants Trump to steal it for a border wall. Gardner's inability to stand up for his own state led one hometown newspaper to call its 2014 endorsement of Gardner <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/cory-gardner-regret-denver-post-fake-emergency/\">a mistake</a>.</p>\n<p>In Georgia, Sen. David Perdue is completely supportive of Trump's desire to take up to $260 million from military bases in his state and use it for a border wall. Trump theft could <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/pentagon-millions-could-cut-from-military-projects-cover-border-wall/pYh0RMQNWNLUamIoZnlHGK/\">include</a> &quot;$99 million for a cyber instructional facility at Fort Gordon, nearly $31 million for a hangar at Moody Air Force base and more than $75 million for a combat vehicle warehouse and body repair shop at Albany's Marine Corps Logistics Base.&quot;</p>\n<p>Perdue, a staunch Trump ally who has been <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/stacey-abrams-david-perdue-senate-georgia-poll/\">described</a> as within Trump's circle of trust, could face a stiff re-election challenge if Stacey Abrams enters the race. Abrams narrowly lost the 2018 race to be Georgia's governor, unable to overcome years of voter suppression efforts led by her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp.</p>\n<p>In North Carolina, the flip-flopping Sen. Thom Tillis was <a href=\"https://shareblue.com/vulnerable-thom-tillis-ditches-constitution-national-emergency-back-trump/\">initially opposed</a> to Trump's fake emergency, but then went back on his word and voted exactly how Trump told him to. In doing so, he jeopardized more than half a billion dollars worth of funding for the military in his state. Tillis is willing to abandon water treatment plant improvements and a new health care facility for Camp Lejeune just so Trump can build a vanity wall along the border. He's also willing to <a href=\"https://www.wjcl.com/article/military-construction-in-ga-carolinas-among-possible-projects-cut-to-fund-border-wall/26866072\">deprive</a> his state of funding for airfield security at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station.</p>\n<p>Tillis's vote &quot;is a slap in the face to our active duty service members and our veteran community,&quot; Robert Howard, spokesperson for the North Carolina Democratic Party, said in a Monday statement. &quot;Tillis chose his political career over our military, and North Carolina will not forget this easily,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has not made a final decision on which military projects will be robbed. But in just four states, Trump might steal millions of dollars from military personnel just so he can build a wall along the border.</p>\n<p>And the elected senators in those states are not only refusing to stop Trump from taking the money, they are actively supporting his efforts.</p>\n<p><em>Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation.</em></p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://disqus.com/embed/comments/?base=default&f=shareblue&t_i=213101%20https%3A%2F%2Fshareblue.com%2F%3Fp%3D213101&t_u=https%3A%2F%2Famericanindependent.com%2Fsenators-trump-wall-military-families-arizona-colorado-georgia-north-carolina%2F&t_e=GOP%20senators%20sold%20out%20military%20families%20in%20their%20own%20states%20for%20Trump&t_d=GOP%20senators%20sold%20out%20military%20families%20in%20their%20own%20states%20for%20Trump&t_t=GOP%20senators%20sold%20out%20military%20families%20in%20their%20own%20states%20for%20Trump&s_o=default#version=c9a88830014e14db1a266eb16c7bc97b\"></iframe></figure>",

                "text": "When it comes to choosing between military families in their own state or pledging their loyalty to Trump, many vulnerable Republican senators chose Trump.\nOn Monday, Sen. Jack Reed (D-CT) unveiled a list of military projects Trump may steal from to pay for his border wall, including more than millions of dollars from military bases in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina. Each of those states has a Republican senator running for re-election in 2020, and yet they still voted to let Trump rob military families in their own backyard.\nAfter Trump failed in his efforts to get Congress to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, he made up a fake national emergency at the southern border. In doing so, he planned to steal money from military projects, defying the will of Congress and possibly the Constitution.\nCongress had the opportunity to block Trump's fake emergency, but the majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate opted to side with Trump and abandon their loyalty to the Constitution.\nIn Arizona, Sen. Martha McSally was one of those who picked Trump, voting to allow him to swipe up to $150 million from military bases in her state. McSally risked funding for five projects at four locations, including $40 million for two F-35 related projects at Luke Air Force Base.\nJust last month, McSally bragged to a local radio station that she has \"fought for Luke Air Force Base.\" But when Trump demanded that McSally prove her loyalty to him, she promptly gave up that fight in order to do Trump's bidding.\nIn Colorado, embattled Sen. Cory Gardner rankled past supporters by siding with Trump on the fake national emergency. With his vote, Gardner may have cost Fort Carson $77 million desperately needed for upgrades. The money was intended to \"provide troops with a long-awaited, improved vehicle maintenance shop to repair the post's aging fleet of trucks, tanks and Humvees.\"\nInstead, Gardner wants Trump to steal it for a border wall. Gardner's inability to stand up for his own state led one hometown newspaper to call its 2014 endorsement of Gardner a mistake.\nIn Georgia, Sen. David Perdue is completely supportive of Trump's desire to take up to $260 million from military bases in his state and use it for a border wall. Trump theft could include \"$99 million for a cyber instructional facility at Fort Gordon, nearly $31 million for a hangar at Moody Air Force base and more than $75 million for a combat vehicle warehouse and body repair shop at Albany's Marine Corps Logistics Base.\"\nPerdue, a staunch Trump ally who has been described as within Trump's circle of trust, could face a stiff re-election challenge if Stacey Abrams enters the race. Abrams narrowly lost the 2018 race to be Georgia's governor, unable to overcome years of voter suppression efforts led by her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp.\nIn North Carolina, the flip-flopping Sen. Thom Tillis was initially opposed to Trump's fake emergency, but then went back on his word and voted exactly how Trump told him to. In doing so, he jeopardized more than half a billion dollars worth of funding for the military in his state. Tillis is willing to abandon water treatment plant improvements and a new health care facility for Camp Lejeune just so Trump can build a vanity wall along the border. He's also willing to deprive his state of funding for airfield security at Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station.\nTillis's vote \"is a slap in the face to our active duty service members and our veteran community,\" Robert Howard, spokesperson for the North Carolina Democratic Party, said in a Monday statement. \"Tillis chose his political career over our military, and North Carolina will not forget this easily,\" he added.\nThe Trump administration has not made a final decision on which military projects will be robbed. But in just four states, Trump might steal millions of dollars from military personnel just so he can build a wall along the border.\nAnd the elected senators in those states are not only refusing to stop Trump from taking the money, they are actively supporting his efforts.\nPublished with permission of The American Independent Foundation.",

REUTERS/Toby Melville</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Nearly three years after Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU, its departure is uncertain and increasingly impatient European capitals are pressing May to spell out how she plans to resolve the crisis before they can agree to an extension.</p>\n<p>Possible eventual outcomes still range from a long postponement, leaving with May&rsquo;s deal, a disruptive exit without a deal, or even another referendum.</p>\n<p>Ten days before the March 29 exit date that May set, and two days before a crucial EU summit, she was on Tuesday writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a delay, her spokesman said. He did not disclose how long a delay she would seek, but said she believed it should be as short as possible.</p>\n<p>May had earlier warned parliament that if it did not ratify her deal, she would ask to delay Brexit beyond June 30, a step that Brexit&rsquo;s advocates fear would endanger the entire divorce.</p>\n<p>Other EU member states were discussing two main options: a delay of two to three months, if May persuades them she can clinch a deal at home, or much longer if she accepts that radical reworking of the accord is needed.</p>\n<p>The EU&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said an extension would only make sense if it increased the chances of May&rsquo;s deal being ratified by Britain&rsquo;s House of Commons.</p>\n<p>He said the economic and political costs of a delay for the EU had to be weighed against the potential benefits.</p>\n<p>Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said Britain must present a detailed plan on how to push the May&rsquo;s deal through parliament in order to get EU approval for an extension,</p>\n<p>An official in the office of President Emmanuel Macron went further, saying France was ready to veto any British request for a Brexit delay that delays matters without offering a way out of the present deadlock, or imperils European Union institutions.</p>\n<p>The BBC&rsquo;s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said May would ask for an extension until June 30 - which could give her another chance to pass her deal - with the option of a delay of up to two years.</p>\n<h3>BREXIT CRISIS </h3>\n<p>In a move that added to the sense of crisis in London, speaker John Bercow ruled on Monday that May&rsquo;s deal had to be substantially different to be voted on again by parliament.</p>\n<p>Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said a vote this week was now less likely, adding: &ldquo;This is a moment of crisis for our country.&rdquo; But he indicated the government still planned a third vote.</p>\n<p>British lawmakers will in any case be able to debate ways to break the Brexit impasse from Monday, May&rsquo;s spokesman said.</p>\n<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned time was running out, saying: &ldquo;I will fight until the last minute of the time to March 29 for an orderly exit. We haven&rsquo;t got a lot of time for that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Her foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: &ldquo;If more time is needed, it&rsquo;s always better to do another round than a no-deal Brexit.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tusk and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed after talks that they must now &ldquo;see what proposals emerge from London&rdquo; before the EU summit on Thursday and Friday.</p>\n<p>If Britain left with no deal, it would tumble out of the EU&rsquo;s 500-million-strong single market and customs union overnight, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that could mean many import and export tariffs. It would face the prospect of manufacturing and financial market disruptions, sharp economic contraction and border hold-ups..</p>\n<p>However, most senior EU figures, while exasperated by Britain&rsquo;s dithering, have no appetite for pushing it out in 10 days&rsquo; time without a deal.</p>\n<h3>DIVISIONS </h3>\n<p>The 2016 referendum, which produced a 52-48 percent vote to leave, exposed deep divisions in British society and has fueled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism and British identity.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190319&t=2&i=1367989130&r=LYNXNPEF2I0WL\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (3 Images)</p>\n<p>And now Britons&rsquo; patience with negotiations may be running out. In a Comres survey in the Telegraph newspaper, nearly half of respondents said Britain would ultimately thrive if it left without a deal.</p>\n<p>The pressure to come up with changes means May is likely to get only one more chance to put her deal to a vote.</p>\n<p>Bercow said his ruling did not stop the government reshaping its proposal, or having parliament vote to overrule him.</p>\n<p>Brexit Secretary Barclay said a change in context might be sufficient to meet Bercow&rsquo;s test.</p>\n<p>But even before Bercow&rsquo;s intervention, May was having difficulty boosting support for her deal - which would aim to secure close trade and security ties with the EU while leaving its formal structures - after it was defeated by 230 votes on Jan. 15, and by 149 votes on March 12.</p>\n<p>She needs to win over at least 75 lawmakers - dozens of rebels in her own Conservative Party, some Labour lawmakers, and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.</p>\n<p>The DUP said it was unlikely to support the deal in a third vote unless it was convinced it can pass, HuffPost reported.</p>\n<p>In addition to regulating the terms of departure, May&rsquo;s deal promises to take Britain out of the EU single market and customs union, common fisheries and farm policies and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice at the end of a status-quo period in which new trade arrangements would be agreed.</p>",

                "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will ask the European Union to delay Brexit by at least three months after her plan to hold a third vote on her fraught divorce deal was thrown into disarray by a surprise intervention from the speaker of parliament.\nNearly three years after Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU, its departure is uncertain and increasingly impatient European capitals are pressing May to spell out how she plans to resolve the crisis before they can agree to an extension.\nPossible eventual outcomes still range from a long postponement, leaving with May\u2019s deal, a disruptive exit without a deal, or even another referendum.\nTen days before the March 29 exit date that May set, and two days before a crucial EU summit, she was on Tuesday writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for a delay, her spokesman said. He did not disclose how long a delay she would seek, but said she believed it should be as short as possible.\nMay had earlier warned parliament that if it did not ratify her deal, she would ask to delay Brexit beyond June 30, a step that Brexit\u2019s advocates fear would endanger the entire divorce.\nOther EU member states were discussing two main options: a delay of two to three months, if May persuades them she can clinch a deal at home, or much longer if she accepts that radical reworking of the accord is needed.\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said an extension would only make sense if it increased the chances of May\u2019s deal being ratified by Britain\u2019s House of Commons.\nHe said the economic and political costs of a delay for the EU had to be weighed against the potential benefits.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said Britain must present a detailed plan on how to push the May\u2019s deal through parliament in order to get EU approval for an extension,\nAn official in the office of President Emmanuel Macron went further, saying France was ready to veto any British request for a Brexit delay that delays matters without offering a way out of the present deadlock, or imperils European Union institutions.\nThe BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said May would ask for an extension until June 30 - which could give her another chance to pass her deal - with the option of a delay of up to two years.\nBREXIT CRISIS\nIn a move that added to the sense of crisis in London, speaker John Bercow ruled on Monday that May\u2019s deal had to be substantially different to be voted on again by parliament.\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay said a vote this week was now less likely, adding: \u201cThis is a moment of crisis for our country.\u201d But he indicated the government still planned a third vote.\nBritish lawmakers will in any case be able to debate ways to break the Brexit impasse from Monday, May\u2019s spokesman said.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel warned time was running out, saying: \u201cI will fight until the last minute of the time to March 29 for an orderly exit. We haven\u2019t got a lot of time for that.\u201d\nHer foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said: \u201cIf more time is needed, it\u2019s always better to do another round than a no-deal Brexit.\u201d\nTusk and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed after talks that they must now \u201csee what proposals emerge from London\u201d before the EU summit on Thursday and Friday.\nIf Britain left with no deal, it would tumble out of the EU\u2019s 500-million-strong single market and customs union overnight, falling back on World Trade Organisation rules that could mean many import and export tariffs. It would face the prospect of manufacturing and financial market disruptions, sharp economic contraction and border hold-ups..\nHowever, most senior EU figures, while exasperated by Britain\u2019s dithering, have no appetite for pushing it out in 10 days\u2019 time without a deal.\nDIVISIONS\nThe 2016 referendum, which produced a 52-48 percent vote to leave, exposed deep divisions in British society and has fueled soul-searching about everything from secession and immigration to capitalism and British identity.\nSlideshow (3 Images)\nAnd now Britons\u2019 patience with negotiations may be running out. In a Comres survey in the Telegraph newspaper, nearly half of respondents said Britain would ultimately thrive if it left without a deal.\nThe pressure to come up with changes means May is likely to get only one more chance to put her deal to a vote.\nBercow said his ruling did not stop the government reshaping its proposal, or having parliament vote to overrule him.\nBrexit Secretary Barclay said a change in context might be sufficient to meet Bercow\u2019s test.\nBut even before Bercow\u2019s intervention, May was having difficulty boosting support for her deal - which would aim to secure close trade and security ties with the EU while leaving its formal structures - after it was defeated by 230 votes on Jan. 15, and by 149 votes on March 12.\nShe needs to win over at least 75 lawmakers - dozens of rebels in her own Conservative Party, some Labour lawmakers, and the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.\nThe DUP said it was unlikely to support the deal in a third vote unless it was convinced it can pass, HuffPost reported.\nIn addition to regulating the terms of departure, May\u2019s deal promises to take Britain out of the EU single market and customs union, common fisheries and farm policies and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice at the end of a status-quo period in which new trade arrangements would be agreed.",

                "text": "MAPUTO/HARARE (Reuters) - The number of people killed in a powerful cyclone and flooding in Mozambique has risen above 200, more than doubling the country\u2019s death toll from a storm that could rank as one of the worst weather-related disasters in the southern hemisphere.\nMozambique\u2019s President Filipe Nyusi said in a televised statement following a cabinet meeting on the disaster on Tuesday that the death toll after Cylone Idai now stood at more than 200, up from 84.\nWinds of up to 170 kph (105 mph) and flooding swept across southeastern Africa, including Zimbabwe and Mozambique, affecting more than 2.6 million people, United Nations officials said on Tuesday.\nRescue crews were still struggling to reach victims five days later, while aid groups said many survivors were trapped in remote areas, surrounded by wrecked roads, flattened buildings and submerged villages. The Red Cross said at least 400,000 people had been made homeless in central Mozambique alone.\n\u201cThis is the worst humanitarian crisis in Mozambique\u2019s history,\u201d said Jamie LeSueur, who is leading rescue efforts in Beira for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\nThe organization said large areas to the west of the port city of Beira were severely flooded, and in places close to the Buzi and Pungwe rivers flood waters are meters deep, completely submerging homes, telephone poles and trees.\nLeSueur had said earlier on Tuesday, when the death toll was 84, that the full human impact of the disaster remained unclear, and that the figure was likely to rise.\nWhile the official count has increased, it remains well below the 1,000 deaths Nyusi had estimated after flying over some of the worst-hit zones, witnessing submerged villages and bodies floating in the water.\nA general view shows destruction after Cyclone Idai in Beira, Mozambique, March 16-17, 2019 in this still image taken from a social media video on March 19, 2019. Care International/Josh Estey via REUTERS\nThe cyclone hit land near Beira on Thursday and moved inland throughout the weekend, leaving heavy rains in its trail on Tuesday. More rural areas remained unaccessible.\nStudies of satellite images suggested 1.7 million people were in the path of the cyclone in Mozambique and another 920,000 affected in Malawi, said Herve Verhoosel, senior spokesman at the U.N World Food Programme. He gave no figures for Zimbabwe.\nIn Maputo, Mozambique\u2019s capital, people worried about missing relatives.\nTelma fa Gloria, a street vendor, said she had not heard from her mother, who she usually speaks to every day, or her siblings, for days. Her mother\u2019s neighborhood was in one of the worst-hit areas.\n\u201cI\u2019m stitched up, with nothing to do,\u201d she said, adding she was thinking of going to Beira to find out what had happened. \u201cI don\u2019t have the strength to get the news I don\u2019t want to hear, and I don\u2019t wish anyone to hear.\u201d\nWORST FEARS\nHeavy rains preceded the cyclone, compounding the problems.\n\u201cIf the worst fears are realized ... then we can say that it is one of the worst weather-related disasters, tropical-cyclone-related disasters in the southern hemisphere,\u201d said Clare Nullis of the U.N. World Meteorological Organization.\nDroughts are classed as climate-related not weather-related.\nIn Beira, a low-lying coastal city of 500,000 people, Nullis said the water had nowhere to drain.\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\u201cThis is not going to go away quickly,\u201d she said.\nMark Ellul, a 31-year-old British doctor from Manchester who was working at the Beira hospital when the storm hit the city on Thursday, was trapped in a hotel room. He said the hospital suffered significant damage.\n\u201cIt was pretty terrifying during the storm, extremely noisy, frightening and you can hear the flying debris outside,\u201d Ellul said. \u201cIt felt like the windows were going to break, like the storm was going to come into the room.\u201d\nBeira is also home to Mozambique\u2019s second largest port, which serves as a gateway to landlocked countries in the region.\nThe control room of a pipeline that runs from Beira to Zimbabwe and supplies the majority of that country\u2019s fuel has been damaged, Zimbabwe\u2019s Energy Minister Jorum Gumbo told state-owned Herald newspaper on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe, however, have enough stocks in the country and I am told the repairs at Beira may take a week,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\nAID ON THE WAY\nThe European Union announced on Tuesday an initial emergency aid package of 3.5 million euros ($3.97 million) to Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe for logistical support to reach affected people, emergency shelters, hygiene, sanitation and health care.\nBritain has pledged up to 6 million pounds ($7.96 million) in aid.\nCitizens in Zimbabwe are mobilizing donations, including cash, food and clothes to help thousands of families whose homes were wrecked by the cyclone.\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, who visited Chimanimani on Tuesday, told reporters that Tanzania and the United Arab Emirates were also sending donations while neighbors, including South Africa, Botswana and Angola, would also help.\nReporting Manuel Mucari in Maputo and Macdonald Dzirutwe in Harare; Additional reporting by Tom Miles in Geneva, Catarina Demony in Lisbon and Mfuneko Toyana and Emma Rumney in Johannesburg; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Ed Osmond and Richard Chang",

REUTERS/Noah Berger</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The moves provide fresh evidence of Apple&rsquo;s renewed ambitions to enter the autonomous vehicle derby, an effort it calls Project Titan. The talks are focused on next-generation lidar, a sensor that provides a three-dimensional look at the road.</p>\n<p>Apple is seeking lidar units that would be smaller, cheaper and more easily mass produced than current technology, the three people said. The iPhone maker is setting a high bar with demands for a &ldquo;revolutionary design,&rdquo; one of the people familiar with the talks said. The people declined to name the companies Apple has approached.</p>\n<p>The sensor effort means Apple wants to develop the entire chain of hardware to guide autonomous vehicles and has joined automakers and investors in the race to find winning technologies.</p>\n<p>Current lidar systems, including units from Velodyne Inc mounted on Apple&rsquo;s fleet of self-driving test vehicles, use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car. But the systems can cost $100,000 and use mechanical parts to sweep the laser scanners across the road.</p>\n<p>That makes them too bulky and prone to failure for use in mass-produced vehicles. The shortcomings have spurred $1 billion in investment at dozens of startups and mature companies alike to make lidar smaller, cheaper and more robust.</p>\n<p>Apple&rsquo;s interest in next-generation lidar sensors comes as it has sharply increased its road testing while bringing on key hires from Tesla Inc and Alphabet Inc&rsquo;s Google.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear whether the goal of Apple&rsquo;s Project Titan is to build its own vehicle or supply the hardware and software elements of self-driving car while pairing with a partner for the entire vehicle.</p>\n<p>But what is clear from Apple&rsquo;s interest in cheaper lidar systems is that it wants to control the &ldquo;perception stack&rdquo; of sensors, computers and software to drive an autonomous vehicle, regardless of who makes the vehicle, another person familiar with the talks said. The three people familiar with the talks declined to be identified because the discussions are not public.</p>\n<p>In addition to evaluating potential outside suppliers, Apple is believed to have its own internal lidar sensor under development, two of the people said.</p>\n<p>Alphabet-owned Waymo has taken a similar path, assembling a sensor and computer system while inking deals to buy vehicles from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</p>\n<p>Apple gets &ldquo;a lot of optionality by working on the perception stack,&rdquo; said the second person familiar with the talks. &ldquo;Bringing a passenger car to the market is really, really hard, and there&rsquo;s no reason right now they need to jump into it.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>REDUCING COSTS </h3>\n<p>The designs Apple is seeking could potentially be made with conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques, all four people familiar with the talks said.</p>\n<p>That has the potential to lower prices from the many thousands to the hundreds of dollars as the sensors are produced in larger numbers, similar to chips in phones and other devices. Apple also wants sensors that can see several hundred meters (yards) down the road.</p>\n<p>The long-distance requirement shows Apple is interested in fully self-driving vehicles, versus the more limited features such as adaptive cruise control used today, two people familiar with the matter said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not happy with most of what they see,&rdquo; the first person familiar with the matter said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re looking for a revolutionary design.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A third person familiar with the matter said Apple is seeking a &ldquo;design-oriented&rdquo; sensor that would be sleek and unobtrusive enough to fit into the overall lines of a vehicle.</p>\n<p>Apple declined to comment.</p>\n<p>Apple once investigated building its own vehicle. The company had a team of more than a dozen engineers dedicated to detailed work such as ensuring doors closed quietly instead of slamming shut, a fourth person briefed on the matter said.</p>\n<p>Apple last year re-hired Doug Field, an Apple veteran who was serving as Tesla&rsquo;s engineering chief, to work on Project Titan. The project has about 1,200 people, according to a count in court documents.</p>\n<p>Field has been putting his stamp on the effort, laying off about 190 workers but also bringing on key hires such as Michael Schwekutsch, who oversaw electric drive train technology at Telsa. Apple also ramped up its testing miles in California, driving nearly 80,000 last year compared to 800 the year before.</p>",

                "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc has held talks with at least four companies as possible suppliers for next-generation lidar sensors in self-driving cars, evaluating the companies\u2019 technology while also still working on its own lidar unit, three people familiar with the discussions said.\nThe moves provide fresh evidence of Apple\u2019s renewed ambitions to enter the autonomous vehicle derby, an effort it calls Project Titan. The talks are focused on next-generation lidar, a sensor that provides a three-dimensional look at the road.\nApple is seeking lidar units that would be smaller, cheaper and more easily mass produced than current technology, the three people said. The iPhone maker is setting a high bar with demands for a \u201crevolutionary design,\u201d one of the people familiar with the talks said. The people declined to name the companies Apple has approached.\nThe sensor effort means Apple wants to develop the entire chain of hardware to guide autonomous vehicles and has joined automakers and investors in the race to find winning technologies.\nCurrent lidar systems, including units from Velodyne Inc mounted on Apple\u2019s fleet of self-driving test vehicles, use laser light pulses to render precise images of the environment around the car. But the systems can cost $100,000 and use mechanical parts to sweep the laser scanners across the road.\nThat makes them too bulky and prone to failure for use in mass-produced vehicles. The shortcomings have spurred $1 billion in investment at dozens of startups and mature companies alike to make lidar smaller, cheaper and more robust.\nApple\u2019s interest in next-generation lidar sensors comes as it has sharply increased its road testing while bringing on key hires from Tesla Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.\nIt remains unclear whether the goal of Apple\u2019s Project Titan is to build its own vehicle or supply the hardware and software elements of self-driving car while pairing with a partner for the entire vehicle.\nBut what is clear from Apple\u2019s interest in cheaper lidar systems is that it wants to control the \u201cperception stack\u201d of sensors, computers and software to drive an autonomous vehicle, regardless of who makes the vehicle, another person familiar with the talks said. The three people familiar with the talks declined to be identified because the discussions are not public.\nIn addition to evaluating potential outside suppliers, Apple is believed to have its own internal lidar sensor under development, two of the people said.\nAlphabet-owned Waymo has taken a similar path, assembling a sensor and computer system while inking deals to buy vehicles from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\nApple gets \u201ca lot of optionality by working on the perception stack,\u201d said the second person familiar with the talks. \u201cBringing a passenger car to the market is really, really hard, and there\u2019s no reason right now they need to jump into it.\u201d\nREDUCING COSTS\nThe designs Apple is seeking could potentially be made with conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques, all four people familiar with the talks said.\nThat has the potential to lower prices from the many thousands to the hundreds of dollars as the sensors are produced in larger numbers, similar to chips in phones and other devices. Apple also wants sensors that can see several hundred meters (yards) down the road.\nThe long-distance requirement shows Apple is interested in fully self-driving vehicles, versus the more limited features such as adaptive cruise control used today, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not happy with most of what they see,\u201d the first person familiar with the matter said. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for a revolutionary design.\u201d\nA third person familiar with the matter said Apple is seeking a \u201cdesign-oriented\u201d sensor that would be sleek and unobtrusive enough to fit into the overall lines of a vehicle.\nApple declined to comment.\nApple once investigated building its own vehicle. The company had a team of more than a dozen engineers dedicated to detailed work such as ensuring doors closed quietly instead of slamming shut, a fourth person briefed on the matter said.\nApple last year re-hired Doug Field, an Apple veteran who was serving as Tesla\u2019s engineering chief, to work on Project Titan. The project has about 1,200 people, according to a count in court documents.\nField has been putting his stamp on the effort, laying off about 190 workers but also bringing on key hires such as Michael Schwekutsch, who oversaw electric drive train technology at Telsa. Apple also ramped up its testing miles in California, driving nearly 80,000 last year compared to 800 the year before.",

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo</p>\n<p>China, the world&rsquo;s biggest energy consumer, was once seen as a &ldquo;shop window&rdquo; for big nuclear developers to show off new technologies, with Beijing embarking on a program to build plants based on designs from France, the United States, Russia and Canada.</p>\n<p>But after years of construction delays, overseas models such as Westinghouse&rsquo;s AP1000 and France&rsquo;s &ldquo;Evolutionary Pressurised Reactor&rdquo; (EPR) are now set to lose out in favor of new localized technologies, industry experts and officials said.</p>\n<p>China signed a technology transfer deal with the United States in 2006 that put the AP1000 at the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of its atomic energy program. It also pledged to use advanced third-generation technology in its safety review after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.</p>\n<p>But by the time the world&rsquo;s first AP1000 and EPR made their debuts in China last year, Chinese designs had become just as viable.</p>\n<p>Though China has yet to complete its first Hualong One, officials are confident it will not encounter the delays suffered by rivals, and say it can compete on safety and cost.</p>\n<p>Beijing has already decided to use the Hualong One for its first newly commissioned nuclear project in three years, set to begin construction later this year at Zhangzhou, a site originally earmarked for the AP1000. [nL3N2152KM]</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The problem with AP1000 &ndash; the delays, the design changes, the supply chain issues and then the trade problems &ndash; has forced their hand, and it has become Hualong,&rdquo; said Li Ning, a nuclear scientist and dean of the College of Energy at Xiamen University.</p>\n<p>He added that China&rsquo;s licensing procedures would also be an advantage for the home grown tech. &ldquo;For the Hualong, there are four reactors already under construction and one of them is near completion already. It is a Chinese design so it wouldn&rsquo;t be very hard to license the next four,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>EDF, France&rsquo;s state-run utility, which helped build the EPR project at Taishan in Guangdong province, declined to comment. Westinghouse, now owned by Brookfield after entering bankruptcy restructuring, also did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<h3>INTERNATIONAL AMBITIONS </h3>\n<p>China&rsquo;s ambitions for the Hualong One extend overseas as well. The first foreign project using the reactor is under construction in Pakistan and the model is in the running for projects in Argentina and Britain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;(Hualong One) is competitive,&rdquo; said Li Xiaoming, assistant general manager of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). &ldquo;The technologies are now just about the same as those of the United States, France and Russia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is the foundation that we will rely on for our future survival and our international competitiveness,&rdquo; Li said.</p>\n<p>China already has four Hualong Ones under construction, with the first, in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian, set to go into operation late next year, ahead of schedule, said Huang Feng, a member of the expert committee of the China Nuclear Energy Association.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;China has already become one of the small number of countries that has independently mastered third-generation nuclear power technology, and it has the conditions and comparative advantages to scale up and go into mass production,&rdquo; he told an industry conference.</p>\n<p>As Beijing gets ready to commission eight reactors a year in order to meet its 2030 clean energy and emissions targets, construction speed will be a crucial consideration, benefiting local developers.</p>\n<p>Huang said the estimated costs of Hualong One and the AP1000 were now roughly the same, and much now depended on scaling up production to cut costs and allow the Chinese design to compete not only with other reactors, but also with coal-fired power.</p>\n<p>Li of CNNC said while foreign-designed projects would still be built, it would &ldquo;make no sense&rdquo; to rely on foreign technology if China&rsquo;s own domestic reactors were equally safe and reliable.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There are probably some technologies where we will continue to cooperate, but overall we will gradually turn to our own,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>($1 = 6.7139 yuan)</p>",

REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest energy consumer, was once seen as a \u201cshop window\u201d for big nuclear developers to show off new technologies, with Beijing embarking on a program to build plants based on designs from France, the United States, Russia and Canada.\nBut after years of construction delays, overseas models such as Westinghouse\u2019s AP1000 and France\u2019s \u201cEvolutionary Pressurised Reactor\u201d (EPR) are now set to lose out in favor of new localized technologies, industry experts and officials said.\nChina signed a technology transfer deal with the United States in 2006 that put the AP1000 at the \u201ccore\u201d of its atomic energy program. It also pledged to use advanced third-generation technology in its safety review after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant disaster.\nBut by the time the world\u2019s first AP1000 and EPR made their debuts in China last year, Chinese designs had become just as viable.\nThough China has yet to complete its first Hualong One, officials are confident it will not encounter the delays suffered by rivals, and say it can compete on safety and cost.\nBeijing has already decided to use the Hualong One for its first newly commissioned nuclear project in three years, set to begin construction later this year at Zhangzhou, a site originally earmarked for the AP1000. [nL3N2152KM]\n\u201cThe problem with AP1000 \u2013 the delays, the design changes, the supply chain issues and then the trade problems \u2013 has forced their hand, and it has become Hualong,\u201d said Li Ning, a nuclear scientist and dean of the College of Energy at Xiamen University.\nHe added that China\u2019s licensing procedures would also be an advantage for the home grown tech. \u201cFor the Hualong, there are four reactors already under construction and one of them is near completion already. It is a Chinese design so it wouldn\u2019t be very hard to license the next four,\u201d he said.\nEDF, France\u2019s state-run utility, which helped build the EPR project at Taishan in Guangdong province, declined to comment. Westinghouse, now owned by Brookfield after entering bankruptcy restructuring, also did not respond to a request for comment.\nINTERNATIONAL AMBITIONS\nChina\u2019s ambitions for the Hualong One extend overseas as well. The first foreign project using the reactor is under construction in Pakistan and the model is in the running for projects in Argentina and Britain.\n\u201c(Hualong One) is competitive,\u201d said Li Xiaoming, assistant general manager of the state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). \u201cThe technologies are now just about the same as those of the United States, France and Russia.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the foundation that we will rely on for our future survival and our international competitiveness,\u201d Li said.\nChina already has four Hualong Ones under construction, with the first, in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian, set to go into operation late next year, ahead of schedule, said Huang Feng, a member of the expert committee of the China Nuclear Energy Association.\n\u201cChina has already become one of the small number of countries that has independently mastered third-generation nuclear power technology, and it has the conditions and comparative advantages to scale up and go into mass production,\u201d he told an industry conference.\nAs Beijing gets ready to commission eight reactors a year in order to meet its 2030 clean energy and emissions targets, construction speed will be a crucial consideration, benefiting local developers.\nHuang said the estimated costs of Hualong One and the AP1000 were now roughly the same, and much now depended on scaling up production to cut costs and allow the Chinese design to compete not only with other reactors, but also with coal-fired power.\nLi of CNNC said while foreign-designed projects would still be built, it would \u201cmake no sense\u201d to rely on foreign technology if China\u2019s own domestic reactors were equally safe and reliable.\n\u201cThere are probably some technologies where we will continue to cooperate, but overall we will gradually turn to our own,\u201d he said.\n($1 = 6.7139 yuan)",

REUTERS/Baz Ratner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) analyses Boeing&rsquo;s plans for a software fix prompted by the first crash five months ago, the European Union&rsquo;s aviation safety agency EASA promised its own deep look at any design improvements.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We will not allow the aircraft to fly if we have not found acceptable answers to all our questions,&rdquo; EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky told an EU parliament committee hearing.</p>\n<p>Canada said it would independently certify the 737 MAX in the future, rather than accepting FAA validation, and would conduct an &ldquo;exhaustive review&rdquo; of the automated flight control system in MAX aircraft, known as MCAS, which experts believe may have played a role in both crashes.</p>\n<p>Canada also said it would send a team to help U.S. authorities evaluate proposed design changes and decide if others were needed.</p>\n<p>Boeing Co declined to comment. The company on Tuesday reshuffled the top executives in its commercial airplanes unit to focus on the accident investigations.</p>\n<p>U.S. government officials do not believe the two crashes will lead to a worldwide shift away from FAA certifications but U.S. lawmakers, as well as federal prosecutors, are scrutinizing the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.</p>\n<p>The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives transportation committee and another key Democrat asked the Transportation Department&rsquo;s inspector general on Tuesday to examine key decisions made by the FAA in certifying the 737 MAX jet for use.</p>\n<p>The FAA declined to comment on that request or on actions taken by other countries, but said in a statement that &ldquo;the current, historic aviation safety record in the U.S. and globally is achieved through the FAA&rsquo;s robust processes and full collaboration with the aviation community.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The U.S. Transportation Department&rsquo;s inspector general plans to audit the FAA&rsquo;s certification of the jet, an official with the office said on Tuesday. The office can recommend changes or improvements to how the FAA operates. Boeing said it would cooperate with the audit.</p>\n<h3>UNUSUAL INTERVENTION </h3>\n<p>The unusual public intervention by two leading regulators came as a probe into the final minutes of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 turned toward secrets hidden in the cockpit voice recorder.</p>\n<p>The voices of Captain Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed could help explain the March 10 crash of the Boeing 737 MAX that has worrying parallels with another disaster involving the same model off Indonesia in October.</p>\n<p>The twin disasters killed 346 people, but there is no conclusive evidence so far that they are linked.</p>\n<p>Black box data was downloaded in France but only Ethiopian experts leading the probe have access to the dialogue between Getachew, 29, and Mohammed, 25. The data was back in Addis Ababa on Tuesday, sources familiar with the probe told Reuters.</p>\n<p>Experts believe the new MCAS system, which is designed to stop stalling by dipping the nose, may have been a factor in both crashes, with pilots unable to override it as their jets plunged downwards.</p>\n<p>Both came down just minutes after take-off after erratic flight patterns and loss of control reported by the pilots. However, every accident is a unique chain of human and technical factors, experts say.</p>\n<p>The prestige of Ethiopian Airlines, one of Africa&rsquo;s most successful companies, and Boeing, the world&rsquo;s biggest planemaker and a massive U.S. exporter, are at stake.</p>\n<h3>AWKWARD QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY </h3>\n<p>Lawmakers and safety experts are questioning how thoroughly regulators vetted the MAX model and how well pilots were trained on new features. For now, global regulators have grounded the existing fleet of more than 300 MAX aircraft, and deliveries of nearly 5,000 more - worth well over $500 billion - are on hold. (Graphic: <a href=\"https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC\">tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC</a>)</p>\n<p>Pressure on Chicago-headquartered Boeing has grown with news that federal prosecutors are scrutinising how carefully the MAX model was developed, two people briefed on the matter said.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Justice Department is also looking at the FAA&rsquo;s oversight of Boeing, one of the people said. And a federal grand jury last week issued at least one subpoena to an entity involved in the plane&rsquo;s development.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190319&t=2&i=1368025958&r=LYNXNPEF2I166\"></img></figure>\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump plans to nominate former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson to head the FAA on Tuesday. The agency has been without a permanent head for 14 months.</p>\n<p>In the hope of getting its MAX line back into the air soon, Boeing has said it will roll out a software update and revise pilot training. In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, it has raised questions about whether crew used the correct procedures.</p>\n<p>Development of the 737 MAX, which offers cost savings of about 15 percent on fuel, began in 2011 after the successful launch by its main rival of the Airbus A320neo. The 737 MAX entered service in 2017 after six years of preparation.</p>\n<p>Argus Research cut Boeing stock to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; from &ldquo;buy&rdquo;, giving the planemaker at least its fourth downgrade since the crash, Refinitiv data showed. Its shares rose 0.3 percent on Tuesday, to close at $373.43. They are still down more than 11 percent since the crash in Ethiopia.</p>\n<h3>GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS </h3>\n<p>Various firms are reconsidering Boeing orders, and some are revising financial forecasts given they now cannot count on maintenance and fuel savings factored in from the MAX.</p>\n<p>Air Canada said it intended to keep its MAX aircraft grounded until at least July 1, would accelerate intake of recently acquired Airbus A321 planes, and had hired other carriers to provide extra capacity meantime.</p>\n<p>Beyond the corporate ramifications, anguished relatives are still waiting to find out what happened.</p>\n<p>Many have visited the crash site in a charred field to seek some closure, but there is anger at the slow pace of information and all they have been given for funerals is earth.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just so terribly sad. I had to leave here without the body of my dead brother,&rdquo; said Abdulmajid Shariff, a Yemeni relative who headed home disappointed on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Reporting by Maggie Fick in Addis Ababa, Tim Hepher in Paris and David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting by Jason Neely in Addis Ababa, David Ljunggren in Ottawa, Jamie Freed in Singapore, Alastair Macdonald in Brussels, Savio D'Souza in Bengaluru; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne and Ben Klayman; Editing by Keith Weir, Mark Potter and Lisa Shumaker</p>",

                "text": "ADDIS ABABA/PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Europe and Canada said they would seek their own guarantees over the safety of Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX, further complicating plans to get the aircraft flying worldwide after they were grounded in the wake of two accidents killing more than 300 people.\nAs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) analyses Boeing\u2019s plans for a software fix prompted by the first crash five months ago, the European Union\u2019s aviation safety agency EASA promised its own deep look at any design improvements.\n\u201cWe will not allow the aircraft to fly if we have not found acceptable answers to all our questions,\u201d EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky told an EU parliament committee hearing.\nCanada said it would independently certify the 737 MAX in the future, rather than accepting FAA validation, and would conduct an \u201cexhaustive review\u201d of the automated flight control system in MAX aircraft, known as MCAS, which experts believe may have played a role in both crashes.\nCanada also said it would send a team to help U.S. authorities evaluate proposed design changes and decide if others were needed.\nBoeing Co declined to comment. The company on Tuesday reshuffled the top executives in its commercial airplanes unit to focus on the accident investigations.\nU.S. government officials do not believe the two crashes will lead to a worldwide shift away from FAA certifications but U.S. lawmakers, as well as federal prosecutors, are scrutinizing the certification of the Boeing 737 MAX.\nThe chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives transportation committee and another key Democrat asked the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general on Tuesday to examine key decisions made by the FAA in certifying the 737 MAX jet for use.\nThe FAA declined to comment on that request or on actions taken by other countries, but said in a statement that \u201cthe current, historic aviation safety record in the U.S. and globally is achieved through the FAA\u2019s robust processes and full collaboration with the aviation community.\u201d\nThe U.S. Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general plans to audit the FAA\u2019s certification of the jet, an official with the office said on Tuesday. The office can recommend changes or improvements to how the FAA operates. Boeing said it would cooperate with the audit.\nUNUSUAL INTERVENTION\nThe unusual public intervention by two leading regulators came as a probe into the final minutes of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 turned toward secrets hidden in the cockpit voice recorder.\nThe voices of Captain Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed could help explain the March 10 crash of the Boeing 737 MAX that has worrying parallels with another disaster involving the same model off Indonesia in October.\nThe twin disasters killed 346 people, but there is no conclusive evidence so far that they are linked.\nBlack box data was downloaded in France but only Ethiopian experts leading the probe have access to the dialogue between Getachew, 29, and Mohammed, 25. The data was back in Addis Ababa on Tuesday, sources familiar with the probe told Reuters.\nExperts believe the new MCAS system, which is designed to stop stalling by dipping the nose, may have been a factor in both crashes, with pilots unable to override it as their jets plunged downwards.\nBoth came down just minutes after take-off after erratic flight patterns and loss of control reported by the pilots. However, every accident is a unique chain of human and technical factors, experts say.\nThe prestige of Ethiopian Airlines, one of Africa\u2019s most successful companies, and Boeing, the world\u2019s biggest planemaker and a massive U.S. exporter, are at stake.\nAWKWARD QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY\nLawmakers and safety experts are questioning how thoroughly regulators vetted the MAX model and how well pilots were trained on new features. For now, global regulators have grounded the existing fleet of more than 300 MAX aircraft, and deliveries of nearly 5,000 more - worth well over $500 billion - are on hold. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2Hv2btC)\nPressure on Chicago-headquartered Boeing has grown with news that federal prosecutors are scrutinising how carefully the MAX model was developed, two people briefed on the matter said.\nThe U.S. Justice Department is also looking at the FAA\u2019s oversight of Boeing, one of the people said. And a federal grand jury last week issued at least one subpoena to an entity involved in the plane\u2019s development.\nU.S. President Donald Trump plans to nominate former Delta Air Lines executive Steve Dickson to head the FAA on Tuesday. The agency has been without a permanent head for 14 months.\nIn the hope of getting its MAX line back into the air soon, Boeing has said it will roll out a software update and revise pilot training. In the case of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, it has raised questions about whether crew used the correct procedures.\nDevelopment of the 737 MAX, which offers cost savings of about 15 percent on fuel, began in 2011 after the successful launch by its main rival of the Airbus A320neo. The 737 MAX entered service in 2017 after six years of preparation.\nArgus Research cut Boeing stock to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d, giving the planemaker at least its fourth downgrade since the crash, Refinitiv data showed. Its shares rose 0.3 percent on Tuesday, to close at $373.43. They are still down more than 11 percent since the crash in Ethiopia.\nGLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS\nVarious firms are reconsidering Boeing orders, and some are revising financial forecasts given they now cannot count on maintenance and fuel savings factored in from the MAX.\nAir Canada said it intended to keep its MAX aircraft grounded until at least July 1, would accelerate intake of recently acquired Airbus A321 planes, and had hired other carriers to provide extra capacity meantime.\nBeyond the corporate ramifications, anguished relatives are still waiting to find out what happened.\nMany have visited the crash site in a charred field to seek some closure, but there is anger at the slow pace of information and all they have been given for funerals is earth.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so terribly sad. I had to leave here without the body of my dead brother,\u201d said Abdulmajid Shariff, a Yemeni relative who headed home disappointed on Tuesday.\nReporting by Maggie Fick in Addis Ababa, Tim Hepher in Paris and David Shepardson in Washington; Additional reporting by Jason Neely in Addis Ababa, David Ljunggren in Ottawa, Jamie Freed in Singapore, Alastair Macdonald in Brussels, Savio D'Souza in Bengaluru; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne and Ben Klayman; Editing by Keith Weir, Mark Potter and Lisa Shumaker",

                "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday that France would rebuild the fire-devastated Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, saying he hoped the work would be done in five years and the French people would pull together to repair their national symbol.\nMacron devoted a brief prime-time televised address to Monday\u2019s catastrophic blaze in the heart of the capital, again postponing planned remarks on his response to months of anti-government protests.\n\u201cWe will rebuild Notre-Dame even more beautifully and I want it to be completed in five years, we can do it,\u201d Macron said.\n\u201cIt is up to us to convert this disaster into an opportunity to come together, having deeply reflected on what we have been and what we have to be and become better than we are. It is up to us to find the thread of our national project.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a time for politics,\u201d added Macron, who had cancelled a speech planned on Monday evening on the response to the \u201cyellow vest\u201d protests.\nHe visited the site of the fire late on Monday and promised then to rebuild the cathedral, parts of which date to the 12th century.\nThe cathedral spire was destroyed and its roof gutted but the bell towers were still standing and many valuable art works were saved after more than 400 firemen worked to contain the blaze, finally quelling it 14 hours after it began.\nAs the city and the country grieved for a potent national symbol, billionaires, companies and local authorities were quick to offer donations.\nSome 24 hours after the fire started, more than 750 million euros ($845 million) had been pledged, including 500 million from the three billionaire families that own France\u2019s giant luxury goods empires: Kering, LVMH and L\u2019Oreal.\nParis public prosecutor Remy Heitz said there was no obvious indication the fire was arson. Fifty people were working on what would be a long and complex investigation, officials said.\n(Graphic of the Notre-Dame fire: tmsnrt.rs/2XgGCRi)\n(Graphic: Map and timeline - tmsnrt.rs/2DgHcXP)\n(Graphic: 3D diagram of Notre-Dame - tmsnrt.rs/2DgH76t)\nA view of the debris inside Notre-Dame de Paris in the aftermath of a fire that devastated the cathedral, during the visit of French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner (not pictured) in Paris, France, April 16, 2019. Christophe Petit Tesson/Pool via REUTERS\nThe fire swiftly ripped through the cathedral\u2019s oak roof supports, where workmen had been carrying out extensive renovations to the spire\u2019s timber-framed supports. Police began questioning the workers involved, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.\nOne firefighter was injured but no one else was hurt, with the fire starting at around 6:30 p.m. after the building was closed to the public for the evening.\nFirefighters examined the facade, with its spectacular 10-metre filigreed stained-glass rose window still intact. They could be seen walking atop the belfries as police kept the area in lockdown.\nInvestigators will not be able to enter the cathedral\u2019s blackened nave until experts are satisfied its walls withstood the heat and the building is structurally sound.\n\u201cYesterday we thought the whole cathedral would collapse. Yet this morning she is still standing, valiant, despite everything,\u201d said Sister Marie Aimee, a nun who had hurried to a nearby church to pray as the flames spread.\n\u201cCATHEDRAL OF THE PEOPLE\u201d\nMessages of condolence flooded in from around the world.\nPope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, was praying for those affected, the Vatican said, adding: \u201cNotre-Dame will always remain - and we have seen this in these hours - a place where believers and non-believers can come together in the most dramatic moments of French history.\u201d\nBritain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth expressed deep sadness while her son and heir Prince Charles said he was \u201cutterly heartbroken\u201d. Chancellor Angela Merkel offered German help to rebuild a part of \u201cour common European heritage\u201d.\nConsidered among the finest examples of European Gothic architecture, Notre-Dame is visited by more than 13 million people a year. It sits on an island in the Seine, overlooking the Left Bank hangouts of Ernest Hemingway and Pablo Picasso.\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\u201cNotre-Dame de Paris is the cathedral of the people, of the people of Paris, of the French people, of the people of the world. It is part of those references of our history, of what we have in common, of what we share,\u201d said Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.\nIt was at Notre-Dame that Henry VI of England was crowned \u201cKing of France\u201d in 1431, that Napoleon was made emperor in 1804, and Pope Pius X beatified Joan of Arc in 1909. Presidents Charles de Gaulle and Francois Mitterrand were mourned there.\nHUMAN CHAIN\nThe cathedral is owned by the state and has been at the centre of a dispute between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should finance restoration work to collapsed balustrades, crumbling gargoyles and cracked facades.\nIt was too early to estimate the cost of the damage, said the heritage charity Fondation du Patrimoine.\nPaolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace of the fire\u2019s spread had been stunning.\n\u201cWe are used to thinking about them as eternal simply because they have been there for centuries, or a thousand years, but the reality is they are very fragile,\u201d Violini said.\nThe company carrying out the renovation works when the blaze broke out said it would cooperate fully with the investigation.\n\u201cAll I can tell you is that at the moment the fire began none of my employees were on the site. We respected all procedures,\u201d Julien Le Bras, a representative of family firm Le Bras Freres.\nMany relics and artworks were saved. At one point, firefighters, policemen and municipal workers formed a human chain to remove the treasures, including a centuries-old crown of thorns made from reeds and gold, and the tunic believed to have been worn by Saint Louis, a 13th century king of France.\nGold, silver and gem-inlaid chalices, candelabras and many other artefacts survived the blaze.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Inti Landauro, Richard Lough, Sarah White, Emmanuel Jarry, Luke Baker and John Irish in Paris; Additional reporting by Philip Pullella in Rome and Michelle Martin in Berlin; Writing by Richard Lough and Frances Kerry; Editing by Leigh Thomas, Peter Graff and Alison Williams",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nAllianz Global Investors strategist and portfolio manager Neil Dwane said the data had been good enough to allay fears that China\u2019s economy was collapsing, although the rest of the year remained in question.\n\u201cBeijing will now be in a wait-and-see mode to gauge whether it has done enough,\u201d Dwane said, referring to stimulus efforts. \u201cTo be bullish (on stocks) from here you would have to believe in a pretty strong global recovery in the second half... We are a bit more ho-hum.\u201d\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.12 points, or 0.01%, to 26,449.54, the S&P 500 lost 6.61 points, or 0.23%, to 2,900.45 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.15 points, or 0.05%, to 7,996.08.\nMSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.08%.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.5922%, from 2.594% late on Tuesday.\nFor a graphic on World stocks bounce $7.5 trillion since late December, see - tmsnrt.rs/2IoRV6P\nThe euro edged up 0.1% to $1.1296, recovering from losses driven by a Reuters report that several European Central Bank policymakers think the bank\u2019s economic projections are too optimistic.\nAnother currency on the move was the New Zealand dollar, which sank 0.6% to $0.6721 after annual consumer price inflation came in well below expectations, at just 1.5% for the first quarter.\nAgainst a basket of major currencies, the dollar was little changed.\nIn commodity markets, copper touched a nine-month high on strong Chinese economic data and ended 0.9% higher at $6,556 per ton.\nSpot gold, by contrast, slipped to its lowest for the year. It was last down 0.2% at $1,274.25 per ounce.\nOil prices edged lower, reversing course from earlier gains as U.S. government data showed inventories were drawn down less than an industry report had suggested on Tuesday.\nU.S. crude settled at $63.76 a barrel, down 29 cents for a 0.45% decline. Global benchmark Brent crude settled at $71.62 a barrel, down 10 cents for a 0.14% drop.\nReporting by April Joyner; additional reporting by Marc Jones, Noah Browning and Zandi Shabalala in London, Amy Caren Daniel and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and Karen Brettell, Stephen Culp, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Stephanie Kelly in New York; editing by Diane Craft, Dan Grebler and Susan Thomas",

REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan</p>\n<p>Widodo grew up in a riverside slum and was the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite. Popularly known as Jokowi, his everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;NO BURNING&rsquo; </h3>\n<p>The eight-hour vote on Wednesday for both the presidency and legislature seats across a country that stretches more than 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from its western to eastern tips was both a Herculean logistical feat and testimony to the resilience of democracy two decades after authoritarianism was defeated.</p>\n<p>The poll followed a campaign dominated by economic issues but was also marked by the growing influence of conservative Islam in the world&rsquo;s biggest Muslim-majority nation.</p>\n<p>A senior government official close to the president said before the election that a win for Widodo with 52-55 percent of the vote would be a &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo;, and enough of a mandate to press on with, and even accelerate, reforms.</p>\n<p>The official election results will not be published until May. Any disputes can be taken to the Constitutional Court where a nine-judge panel will have 14 days to rule on them.</p>\n<p>More than 10,000 volunteers crowd-sourced results posted at polling stations in a real-time bid to thwart attempts at fraud.</p>\n<p>However, even before the election, the opposition alleged voter-list irregularities that it said could affect millions and vowed legal or &ldquo;people power&rdquo; action if its concerns were ignored.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190417&t=2&i=1377745502&r=LYNXNPEF3G07A\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (17 Images)</p>\n<p>Ferdinand Hutahaen, a spokesman for the Prabowo campaign, sought to soothe concerns this could mean a violent response.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t consider &lsquo;people power&rsquo; as a form of violence,&rdquo; he told reporters. &ldquo;There will be no burning, killing. We will see what kind of &lsquo;people power&rsquo; and revolution society wants. We don&rsquo;t want conflict in this country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Prabowo&rsquo;s supporters would march in central Jakarta after midday prayers on Friday, campaign officials said.</p>\n<h3>REFORM AGENDA </h3>\n<p>Analysts are trying to assess whether Widodo will accelerate the cautious reform agenda of his first term and open up more areas to foreign investors, or even try to free up restrictive labor laws.</p>\n<p>This will partly hinge on his ability to get laws through a newly elected parliament and to take on nationalist forces.</p>\n<p>Widodo campaigned on his record of deregulation and improving infrastructure, calling it a step to tackling inequality and poverty in Southeast Asia&rsquo;s biggest economy.</p>\n<p>But religion has also been a factor. Conservative Muslim groups have been increasingly influential.</p>\n<p>Widodo, a moderate Muslim from Java island, had to burnish his Islamic credentials after smear campaigns and hoax stories accused him of being anti-Islam, a communist or too close to China, all politically damaging in Indonesia. He picked Islamic cleric Ma&rsquo;ruf Amin, 76, as his running mate.</p>\n<p>Prabowo, a former special forces commander who has links to some hardline Muslim groups, and his running mate, business entrepreneur Sandiaga Uno, pledged to boost the economy by slashing taxes and cutting food prices.</p>\n<p>(Graphic: President Joko Widodo's achievements - <a href=\"https://tmsnrt.rs/2CRgHYC\">tmsnrt.rs/2CRgHYC</a>)</p>\n<p>Additional reporting by Agustinus Beo da Costa, Maikel Jefriando, Tabita Diela, Kanupriya Kapoor, Jessica Damiana and Cindy Silviana in Jakarta, Tommy Ardiansyah in Bogor, Mas Alina Arifin in Bandar Lampung; Writing by John Chalmers and Ed Davies; Editing by Robert Birsel</p>",

                "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo appeared set for a second term as \u201cquick count\u201d results from Wednesday\u2019s election rolled in, but his challenger claimed that he had won the popular vote and urged supporters not to let his victory be snatched away.\nData from private pollsters based on counts of vote samples were in line with opinion polls that had predicted a win for Widodo, a former furniture businessman and low-key reformist.\nThey showed him winning the popular vote with about 54 percent, with a lead of between 7.1 and 11.6 percentage points over former general Prabowo Subianto, who was narrowly defeated when he took Widodo on in the last election five years ago.\nIn previous elections, the counts from reputable companies proved to be accurate.\nBut Prabowo, a former son-in-law of military strongman Suharto who was overthrown in 1998, told a news conference that - based on internal exit polls and \u201cquick count\u201d numbers - his campaign believed his share of the vote was in a 52-54 percent range.\n\u201cWe have noted several incidents that have harmed the supporters of this ticket,\u201d he said, without giving detail. \u201cThe truth will win.\u201d\nIn 2014, Prabowo had also claimed victory on election day, before contesting the results at the Constitutional Court, which confirmed Widodo\u2019s win.\nWidodo said the results indicated he had regained the presidency of the world\u2019s fourth-most-populous nation, but urged supporters to wait for the election commission to announce official results.\nKevin O\u2019Rourke, a political analyst and author of the Indonesia-focused newsletter Reformasi Weekly, said that Widodo\u2019s re-election was now clear but his victory over 67-year-old Prabowo was not resounding.\n\u201cHe failed to attain the psychological 60 percent level that had seemed within reach,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cPrabowo performed better than expected, which may embolden him to run yet again in 2024, if he is sufficiently fit.\u201d\nIndonesian presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto shows his ink-stained finger after casting his vote at a polling booth during elections in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia April 17, 2019. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\nWidodo grew up in a riverside slum and was the first national leader to come from outside the political and military elite. Popularly known as Jokowi, his everyman image resonated in 2014 with voters tired of the old guard.\n\u2018NO BURNING\u2019\nThe eight-hour vote on Wednesday for both the presidency and legislature seats across a country that stretches more than 5,000 km (3,000 miles) from its western to eastern tips was both a Herculean logistical feat and testimony to the resilience of democracy two decades after authoritarianism was defeated.\nThe poll followed a campaign dominated by economic issues but was also marked by the growing influence of conservative Islam in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority nation.\nA senior government official close to the president said before the election that a win for Widodo with 52-55 percent of the vote would be a \u201csweet spot\u201d, and enough of a mandate to press on with, and even accelerate, reforms.\nThe official election results will not be published until May. Any disputes can be taken to the Constitutional Court where a nine-judge panel will have 14 days to rule on them.\nMore than 10,000 volunteers crowd-sourced results posted at polling stations in a real-time bid to thwart attempts at fraud.\nHowever, even before the election, the opposition alleged voter-list irregularities that it said could affect millions and vowed legal or \u201cpeople power\u201d action if its concerns were ignored.\nSlideshow (17 Images)\nFerdinand Hutahaen, a spokesman for the Prabowo campaign, sought to soothe concerns this could mean a violent response.\n\u201cDon\u2019t consider \u2018people power\u2019 as a form of violence,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere will be no burning, killing. We will see what kind of \u2018people power\u2019 and revolution society wants. We don\u2019t want conflict in this country.\u201d\nPrabowo\u2019s supporters would march in central Jakarta after midday prayers on Friday, campaign officials said.\nREFORM AGENDA\nAnalysts are trying to assess whether Widodo will accelerate the cautious reform agenda of his first term and open up more areas to foreign investors, or even try to free up restrictive labor laws.\nThis will partly hinge on his ability to get laws through a newly elected parliament and to take on nationalist forces.\nWidodo campaigned on his record of deregulation and improving infrastructure, calling it a step to tackling inequality and poverty in Southeast Asia\u2019s biggest economy.\nBut religion has also been a factor. Conservative Muslim groups have been increasingly influential.\nWidodo, a moderate Muslim from Java island, had to burnish his Islamic credentials after smear campaigns and hoax stories accused him of being anti-Islam, a communist or too close to China, all politically damaging in Indonesia. He picked Islamic cleric Ma\u2019ruf Amin, 76, as his running mate.\nPrabowo, a former special forces commander who has links to some hardline Muslim groups, and his running mate, business entrepreneur Sandiaga Uno, pledged to boost the economy by slashing taxes and cutting food prices.\n(Graphic: President Joko Widodo's achievements - tmsnrt.rs/2CRgHYC)\nAdditional reporting by Agustinus Beo da Costa, Maikel Jefriando, Tabita Diela, Kanupriya Kapoor, Jessica Damiana and Cindy Silviana in Jakarta, Tommy Ardiansyah in Bogor, Mas Alina Arifin in Bandar Lampung; Writing by John Chalmers and Ed Davies; Editing by Robert Birsel",

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Shares of the sixth-largest U.S. bank were up 1.4 percent to $47.69 in morning trading.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley gets about half its annual revenue from wealth management, which helps it ride out weak periods for trading and investment banking. Both of those businesses suffered during the first quarter at Morgan Stanley and its Wall Street rivals because of subdued volatility.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This quarter ... shows the resiliency of wealth management, which is an important indicator of the health of our business,&rdquo; Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview.</p>\n<p>The bank also cut non-interest expenses by 4 percent, which helped boost its bottom line.</p>\n<p>Overall, Morgan Stanley reported a quarterly profit of $2.34 billion, or $1.39 per share, down from $2.58 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share. <a href=\"https://mgstn.ly/2vaVd4I\">mgstn.ly/2vaVd4I</a></p>\n<p>Its revenue fell 7 percent to $10.29 billion.</p>\n<p>Both metrics still beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.17 per share and revenue of $9.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>\n<p>Wealth management revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with profit margins holding steady at 27 percent. But the business looks robust compared with institutional securities, analysts said. That unit reported steep declines across trading, underwriting and investment banking.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Wealth management was able to protect the margin in a tougher backdrop&rdquo; than the year-ago period, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients. The performance &ldquo;should make people more optimistic considering the lift in markets and better underwriting environment lately.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Concerns about a slowing global economy, U.S. trade tensions with China and the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate policy spurred worries of recession risk early in 2019. But those concerns seem to have subsided, Pruzan said.</p>\n<p>Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s wealth management profit margin and its return on equity of 13.1 percent were comfortably within the targeted range Chief Executive James Gorman has set. Investors watch that return figure closely, because it measures how much profit a bank produces from shareholder capital.</p>\n<p>Gorman, who took the helm in 2010, has defined his tenure by building out the wealth management business, dialing back bond trading and generally reducing risk across the franchise.</p>\n<p>Like in previous quarters, an analyst asked Gorman on a conference call why he has not lifted performance targets for wealth management, given how easily the business has been meeting the 26 percent to 28 percent range he set.</p>\n<p>Gorman again reminded analysts that the margins were far lower when he first set about growing the wealth unit. But now, the business produces returns of nearly 25 percent in difficult times, and might do better, he said, without raising the target.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no magic to this,&rdquo; said Gorman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty consistent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>By contrast, top rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc remains more weighted toward capital markets businesses and is struggling to produce more stable results. On Monday, Goldman reported a 20 percent profit decline and lower revenue across nearly all its major businesses, sending its shares down more than 3 percent.</p>\n<p>Analysts also asked about Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s recently announced plan to acquire Solium Capital Inc, a software provider that helps businesses manage employee stock plans.</p>\n<p>Gorman explained that the business will help Morgan Stanley interface with roughly 3,000 small companies and 2.5 million individuals. That benefits Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s wealth business, which will oversee the accounts, but also allows the bank to offer cash management services and potentially handle stock offerings for companies that go public.</p>\n<p>The transaction is expected to close in May, he said.</p>",

                "text": "(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley reported a 9 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but managed to beat analyst estimates through slight growth in its wealth management business, as well as cost cuts.\nShares of the sixth-largest U.S. bank were up 1.4 percent to $47.69 in morning trading.\nMorgan Stanley gets about half its annual revenue from wealth management, which helps it ride out weak periods for trading and investment banking. Both of those businesses suffered during the first quarter at Morgan Stanley and its Wall Street rivals because of subdued volatility.\n\u201cThis quarter ... shows the resiliency of wealth management, which is an important indicator of the health of our business,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said in an interview.\nThe bank also cut non-interest expenses by 4 percent, which helped boost its bottom line.\nOverall, Morgan Stanley reported a quarterly profit of $2.34 billion, or $1.39 per share, down from $2.58 billion, or $1.45 per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding items, the company earned $1.33 per share. mgstn.ly/2vaVd4I\nIts revenue fell 7 percent to $10.29 billion.\nBoth metrics still beat Wall Street expectations. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.17 per share and revenue of $9.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nWealth management revenue rose slightly from a year ago, with profit margins holding steady at 27 percent. But the business looks robust compared with institutional securities, analysts said. That unit reported steep declines across trading, underwriting and investment banking.\n\u201cWealth management was able to protect the margin in a tougher backdrop\u201d than the year-ago period, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to clients. The performance \u201cshould make people more optimistic considering the lift in markets and better underwriting environment lately.\u201d\nConcerns about a slowing global economy, U.S. trade tensions with China and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy spurred worries of recession risk early in 2019. But those concerns seem to have subsided, Pruzan said.\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s wealth management profit margin and its return on equity of 13.1 percent were comfortably within the targeted range Chief Executive James Gorman has set. Investors watch that return figure closely, because it measures how much profit a bank produces from shareholder capital.\nGorman, who took the helm in 2010, has defined his tenure by building out the wealth management business, dialing back bond trading and generally reducing risk across the franchise.\nLike in previous quarters, an analyst asked Gorman on a conference call why he has not lifted performance targets for wealth management, given how easily the business has been meeting the 26 percent to 28 percent range he set.\nGorman again reminded analysts that the margins were far lower when he first set about growing the wealth unit. But now, the business produces returns of nearly 25 percent in difficult times, and might do better, he said, without raising the target.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no magic to this,\u201d said Gorman. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty consistent.\u201d\nBy contrast, top rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc remains more weighted toward capital markets businesses and is struggling to produce more stable results. On Monday, Goldman reported a 20 percent profit decline and lower revenue across nearly all its major businesses, sending its shares down more than 3 percent.\nAnalysts also asked about Morgan Stanley\u2019s recently announced plan to acquire Solium Capital Inc, a software provider that helps businesses manage employee stock plans.\nGorman explained that the business will help Morgan Stanley interface with roughly 3,000 small companies and 2.5 million individuals. That benefits Morgan Stanley\u2019s wealth business, which will oversee the accounts, but also allows the bank to offer cash management services and potentially handle stock offerings for companies that go public.\nThe transaction is expected to close in May, he said.",

REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo</p>\n<p>If the plan is adopted, New York may become the first major U.S. city to follow the lead of London, which began levying a congestion charge on vehicles driving into the city center in 2003, and a handful of other international cities.</p>\n<p>Cuomo has long favored the new toll to generate revenue for an aging subway system that has been plagued by delays and closures. The mayor, who had favored raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers rather than congestion pricing, said he was dropping his opposition.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I still believe a millionaires tax provides the best, most sustainable revenue source for the transit improvements our city needs,&rdquo; de Blasio said in a statement. &ldquo;But the time to act is running out, and among all alternatives, congestion pricing has the greatest prospects for immediate success.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Under the plan, which requires approval from the state legislature, most people who drive into Manhattan below 61st Street, or roughly everywhere south of Central Park, will have to pay a toll. The toll amounts are to be set by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a luxury to drive into Manhattan,&rdquo; Cuomo said in a radio interview with WNYC on Tuesday, noting that most vehicles filling Manhattan each day drove in from another state.</p>\n<p>Both Cuomo and de Blasio have said the city&rsquo;s subway system, one of the world&rsquo;s busiest, is in a crisis as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the system, struggles to find funding to fix aging infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>LATE TRAINS, CROWDED CARS AND ANCIENT SIGNALS </h3>\n<p>About a third of trains run late. Decades-old signals require large gaps between trains, leading to commuters struggling to squeeze into crowded railway cars at rush hour.</p>\n<p>The MTA estimates that it needs between $41 billion and $60 billion to pay for improvements and repairs under its next five-year capital plan that begins next year, on top of its roughly $17 billion annual operating budget.</p>\n<p>A working group created by the state legislature last year recommended congestion pricing, saying it could generate $1 billion or more a year. The revenue would support at least $15 billion in bonded financing over the next decade, the group said.</p>\n<p>Drivers unhappy at the new toll could take consolation in estimates that traffic would move 20 percent faster than the current average of 7.1 miles per hour (11.4 kph) under the plan, the working group said.</p>\n<p>Officials in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle have also discussed congestion pricing, a system that succeeded in reducing air pollution and traffic in London, which currently charges drivers &pound;11.50 ($15.24) per day during weekday business hours.</p>\n<p>Transit advocacy groups welcomed the proposal, saying the mayor&rsquo;s relenting was an important step forward.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a silver bullet to fixing the current crisis, but it raises a significant amount of money,&rdquo; Jaqi Cohen, the campaign coordinator at the New York commuter advocacy group the Straphangers Campaign, said in a telephone interview.</p>\n<p>Cuomo promised additional new revenue would come from a tax on cannabis as he moves to legalize it in the state.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190226&t=2&i=1360653220&r=LYNXNPEF1P1A9\"></img></figure>\n<p>The governor and the mayor said they expected reduced tolls during off-peak hours, and exemptions for vehicles driven by or transporting people with disabilities, among other categories.</p>\n<p>The FDR Drive, the main highway tracing Manhattan&rsquo;s east side and a primary thoroughfare connecting the island to the city&rsquo;s outer boroughs, will also not carry a toll.</p>\n<p>Taxis and other for-hire vehicles, which have been subject to a congestion surcharge of up to $2.75 for each ride in much of Manhattan since January, would not have to pay the additional congestion toll under Cuomo&rsquo;s plan. The proposed exemption and others, however, are subject to negotiation with state lawmakers.</p>",

REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File Photo\nIf the plan is adopted, New York may become the first major U.S. city to follow the lead of London, which began levying a congestion charge on vehicles driving into the city center in 2003, and a handful of other international cities.\nCuomo has long favored the new toll to generate revenue for an aging subway system that has been plagued by delays and closures. The mayor, who had favored raising taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers rather than congestion pricing, said he was dropping his opposition.\n\u201cI still believe a millionaires tax provides the best, most sustainable revenue source for the transit improvements our city needs,\u201d de Blasio said in a statement. \u201cBut the time to act is running out, and among all alternatives, congestion pricing has the greatest prospects for immediate success.\u201d\nUnder the plan, which requires approval from the state legislature, most people who drive into Manhattan below 61st Street, or roughly everywhere south of Central Park, will have to pay a toll. The toll amounts are to be set by the end of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a luxury to drive into Manhattan,\u201d Cuomo said in a radio interview with WNYC on Tuesday, noting that most vehicles filling Manhattan each day drove in from another state.\nBoth Cuomo and de Blasio have said the city\u2019s subway system, one of the world\u2019s busiest, is in a crisis as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that runs the system, struggles to find funding to fix aging infrastructure.\nLATE TRAINS, CROWDED CARS AND ANCIENT SIGNALS\nAbout a third of trains run late. Decades-old signals require large gaps between trains, leading to commuters struggling to squeeze into crowded railway cars at rush hour.\nThe MTA estimates that it needs between $41 billion and $60 billion to pay for improvements and repairs under its next five-year capital plan that begins next year, on top of its roughly $17 billion annual operating budget.\nA working group created by the state legislature last year recommended congestion pricing, saying it could generate $1 billion or more a year. The revenue would support at least $15 billion in bonded financing over the next decade, the group said.\nDrivers unhappy at the new toll could take consolation in estimates that traffic would move 20 percent faster than the current average of 7.1 miles per hour (11.4 kph) under the plan, the working group said.\nOfficials in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle have also discussed congestion pricing, a system that succeeded in reducing air pollution and traffic in London, which currently charges drivers \u00a311.50 ($15.24) per day during weekday business hours.\nTransit advocacy groups welcomed the proposal, saying the mayor\u2019s relenting was an important step forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet to fixing the current crisis, but it raises a significant amount of money,\u201d Jaqi Cohen, the campaign coordinator at the New York commuter advocacy group the Straphangers Campaign, said in a telephone interview.\nCuomo promised additional new revenue would come from a tax on cannabis as he moves to legalize it in the state.\nThe governor and the mayor said they expected reduced tolls during off-peak hours, and exemptions for vehicles driven by or transporting people with disabilities, among other categories.\nThe FDR Drive, the main highway tracing Manhattan\u2019s east side and a primary thoroughfare connecting the island to the city\u2019s outer boroughs, will also not carry a toll.\nTaxis and other for-hire vehicles, which have been subject to a congestion surcharge of up to $2.75 for each ride in much of Manhattan since January, would not have to pay the additional congestion toll under Cuomo\u2019s plan. The proposed exemption and others, however, are subject to negotiation with state lawmakers.",

REUTERS/Edgar Su</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Fifty people died at two mosques in the South Island city on Friday when a gunman burst in, spraying bullets at his victims while they prayed in a city now consumed by grief and sadness.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to give the message to the person who did this, or if he has any friends who also think like this: I still love you,&rdquo; Farhid Ahmed, 59, told Reuters in an interview at his house, as mourners arrived to offer condolences for his wife, Husna.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with what you did &hellip; you took a wrong decision, a wrong direction, but I want to believe in you. That you have great potential in your heart,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged on Saturday with murder over the killings, New Zealand&rsquo;s worst mass shooting. Tarrant was remanded without a plea and is due back in court on April 5 where police said he was likely to face more charges.</p>\n<p>Ahmed, who uses a wheelchair after being hit by a car, was in the Al Noor mosque when the shooter burst in. He was praying not where he usually does, in the main room, but in an ante-chamber with a friend.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;As that moment I realized two things. One, definitely it was gunshots, and two, this is my last day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because in that situation, with a wheelchair, it was impossible to get out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the killer did not enter that chamber, and Ahmed was able to escape to the carpark where he watched the massacre unfold from behind a car, on the opposite side of the mosque to where his wife was gunned down outside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People were screaming and rushing to come out ... as they were coming, they were panicking, I saw some people had blood, some people were limping,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>After the gunman left to continue his rampage at another mosque, Ahmed went back inside the building.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It was unbelievable,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On the right hand side, usually where I pray, so many dead bodies.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The wounded were screaming. He comforted them until police arrived, who then took him back outside.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;At that time I did not know that my wife&rsquo;s dead body was (at) the other gate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of the shootings, bewilderment has been a common refrain, as the city comes to grips with the scale of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Voices are barely raised beyond a murmur as office workers, and school children have come to lay flowers near the mosques and at makeshift shrines through the city.</p>\n<p>But there has also been a sense of generosity and solidarity, led by victims such as Ahmed, who has preached at the mosque and advocates forgiveness.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190318&t=2&i=1367784966&r=LYNXNPEF2H20D\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (2 Images)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If there is any chance I get, I want to meet you,&rdquo; he said of the gunman. &ldquo;I want to hug you and I want to tell him in face that I am talking from my heart. I have no grudge against you, I never hated you, I will never hate you,&rdquo; Ahmed said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to hug him and say: &lsquo;I have forgiven him&rsquo;. I want to tell him, if he has any mother, I want to hug her too and I want to tell her that I&rsquo;ll treat you exactly like my aunty ... I want to give that message.&rdquo;</p>",

That you have great potential in your heart,\u201d he said.\nAustralian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged on Saturday with murder over the killings, New Zealand\u2019s worst mass shooting. Tarrant was remanded without a plea and is due back in court on April 5 where police said he was likely to face more charges.\nAhmed, who uses a wheelchair after being hit by a car, was in the Al Noor mosque when the shooter burst in. He was praying not where he usually does, in the main room, but in an ante-chamber with a friend.\n\u201cAs that moment I realized two things. One, definitely it was gunshots, and two, this is my last day,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in that situation, with a wheelchair, it was impossible to get out.\u201d\nBut the killer did not enter that chamber, and Ahmed was able to escape to the carpark where he watched the massacre unfold from behind a car, on the opposite side of the mosque to where his wife was gunned down outside.\n\u201cPeople were screaming and rushing to come out ... as they were coming, they were panicking, I saw some people had blood, some people were limping,\u201d he said.\nAfter the gunman left to continue his rampage at another mosque, Ahmed went back inside the building.\n\u201cIt was unbelievable,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the right hand side, usually where I pray, so many dead bodies.\u201d\nThe wounded were screaming. He comforted them until police arrived, who then took him back outside.\n\u201cAt that time I did not know that my wife\u2019s dead body was (at) the other gate.\u201d\nIn the aftermath of the shootings, bewilderment has been a common refrain, as the city comes to grips with the scale of the tragedy.\nVoices are barely raised beyond a murmur as office workers, and school children have come to lay flowers near the mosques and at makeshift shrines through the city.\nBut there has also been a sense of generosity and solidarity, led by victims such as Ahmed, who has preached at the mosque and advocates forgiveness.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\u201cIf there is any chance I get, I want to meet you,\u201d he said of the gunman. \u201cI want to hug you and I want to tell him in face that I am talking from my heart. I have no grudge against you, I never hated you, I will never hate you,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\u201cI want to hug him and say: \u2018I have forgiven him\u2019. I want to tell him, if he has any mother, I want to hug her too and I want to tell her that I\u2019ll treat you exactly like my aunty ... I want to give that message.\u201d",

Ardern said he &ldquo;uttered the words &lsquo;Hello brother, welcome&rsquo;. His final words&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Of course, he had no idea of the hate that sat behind the door, but his welcome tells us so much &ndash; that he was a member of a faith that welcomed all its members, that showed openness, and care,&rdquo; she told parliament.</p>\n<p>Ardern, who has been widely praised for her compassionate and decisive handling of the tragedy, said she never anticipated having to voice the grief of a nation.</p>\n<p>Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist who was living in Dunedin, on New Zealand&rsquo;s South Island, was charged with murder on Saturday.</p>\n<p>He was remanded without a plea and is due back in court on April 5, when police said he was likely to face more charges.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The families of the fallen will have justice,&rdquo; said Ardern, adding she would never mention the alleged gunman&rsquo;s name.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;He may have sought notoriety, but we in New Zealand will give him nothing. Not even his name.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>She ended her speech with the Arabic greeting &ldquo;Al salam Alaikum&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;Peace be upon you&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The victims, killed at two mosques during Friday prayers, were largely Muslim migrants, refugees and residents from countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, Kuwait, Somalia and others.</p>\n<p>No official list of victims has been released and police said they were &ldquo;acutely aware of frustrations&rdquo; at the length of time taken to formally identify bodies.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While identification may seem straightforward the reality is much more complex, particularly in a situation like this,&rdquo; police said in a statement. Twelve victims had been identified to the satisfaction of the coroner and six of those had been returned to their families, they said.</p>\n<p>Bodies of the victims were being washed and prepared for burial in a Muslim ritual process on Tuesday, with teams of volunteers flown in from overseas to assist with the heavy workload.</p>\n<p>A wheelchair-using worshipper who survived the slaughter at the Al Noor mosque, but whose wife was killed, has offered an olive branch to the gunman, saying he would like to meet him and tell him &ldquo;I still love you&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with what you did &hellip; you took a wrong decision, a wrong direction, but I want to believe in you.

One four-year-old child was transferred to a hospital in Auckland in a critical condition.</p>\n<h3>GUN LAW DEBATE RAGES </h3>\n<p>The gunman used a semi-automatic AR-15 during the mosque shootings, police said. A New Zealand gun shop owner said the store had sold Tarrant four weapons and ammunition online between December 2017 and March 2018, but not the high-powered weapon used in the massacre.</p>\n<p>Ardern has said she supports a ban on semi-automatic weapons and that cabinet has made in-principle decisions to change gun laws which she will announce next Monday.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Part of ensuring the safety of New Zealanders must include a frank examination of our gun laws,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>While some New Zealanders have voluntarily surrendered guns, others have been buying more to beat the ban.</p>\n<p>A gun club in the northern town of Kaitaia burned down early on Tuesday and police were treating the blaze as suspicious.</p>\n<p>Simon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, said he wanted to get details of the changes to see if there could be bipartisan support in parliament. The Nationals draw support from rural areas, where gun ownership is high.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know that change is required. I&rsquo;m willing to look at anything that is going to enhance our safety - that&rsquo;s our position,&rdquo; Bridges told TVNZ.</p>\n<p>Ardern has said that Tarrant emailed a &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; to more than 30 recipients including her office, nine minutes before the attack but it gave no location or specific details. In the document, which was also posted online, Tarrant described himself as &ldquo;Just a ordinary White man, 28 years old&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Ardern was critical of social media platforms for allowing the distribution of hatred and division, including live broadcasts of the attack.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190319&t=2&i=1368156951&r=LYNXNPEF2I1UR\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (23 Images)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility. This of course doesn&rsquo;t take away the responsibility we too must show as a nation, to confront racism, violence and extremism.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A consortium of global technology firms has shared on its collective database the digital fingerprints of more than 800 versions of the video of the mass shooting.</p>\n<p>Anyone caught sharing the massacre video in New Zealand faces a fine of up to NZ$10,000 ($6,855) or up to 14 years in jail.</p>\n<p>Facebook, the world&rsquo;s largest social media network, has said it removed 1.5 million videos within 24 hours of the attack.</p>\n<p>Ardern said there would be an inquiry into what government agencies &ldquo;knew, or could or should have known&rdquo; about the alleged gunman and whether the attack could have been prevented.</p>\n<p>More than 250 New Zealand police are working on the inquiry, with staff from the U.S. FBI and Australia&rsquo;s Federal Police joining them.</p>\n<p>Police will be stationed at mosques around the country when they are open for prayers, and nearby when closed, said Ardern.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we have seen in countries that know the horrors of terrorism more than us, there is a pattern of increased tension and actions over the weeks that follow. That means we do need to ensure that vigilance is maintained.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "CHRISTCHURCH (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday praised the bravery of mosque worshippers as a lone gunman massacred their friends and family, saying the nation stood with its grieving Muslim community in this \u201cdarkest of days\u201d.\nAs preparations for the first burials were underway for the 50 people killed last Friday in the Christchurch mosques mass shooting, Ardern singled out three worshippers, including one of the first killed in the attack.\nHati Mohemmed Daoud Nabi, 71, opened the door to the Al Noor mosque. Ardern said he \u201cuttered the words \u2018Hello brother, welcome\u2019. His final words\u201d.\n\u201cOf course, he had no idea of the hate that sat behind the door, but his welcome tells us so much \u2013 that he was a member of a faith that welcomed all its members, that showed openness, and care,\u201d she told parliament.\nArdern, who has been widely praised for her compassionate and decisive handling of the tragedy, said she never anticipated having to voice the grief of a nation.\nAustralian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist who was living in Dunedin, on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, was charged with murder on Saturday.\nHe was remanded without a plea and is due back in court on April 5, when police said he was likely to face more charges.\n\u201cThe families of the fallen will have justice,\u201d said Ardern, adding she would never mention the alleged gunman\u2019s name.\n\u201cHe may have sought notoriety, but we in New Zealand will give him nothing. Not even his name.\u201d\nShe ended her speech with the Arabic greeting \u201cAl salam Alaikum\u201d, meaning \u201cPeace be upon you\u201d.\nThe victims, killed at two mosques during Friday prayers, were largely Muslim migrants, refugees and residents from countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Turkey, Kuwait, Somalia and others.\nNo official list of victims has been released and police said they were \u201cacutely aware of frustrations\u201d at the length of time taken to formally identify bodies.\n\u201cWhile identification may seem straightforward the reality is much more complex, particularly in a situation like this,\u201d police said in a statement. Twelve victims had been identified to the satisfaction of the coroner and six of those had been returned to their families, they said.\nBodies of the victims were being washed and prepared for burial in a Muslim ritual process on Tuesday, with teams of volunteers flown in from overseas to assist with the heavy workload.\nA wheelchair-using worshipper who survived the slaughter at the Al Noor mosque, but whose wife was killed, has offered an olive branch to the gunman, saying he would like to meet him and tell him \u201cI still love you\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with what you did \u2026 you took a wrong decision, a wrong direction, but I want to believe in you. That you have great potential in your heart,\u201d said Farhid Ahmed, 59.\nRelatives and other people arrive to attend the burial ceremony of the victims of the mosque attacks, at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Christchurch, New Zealand March 20, 2019. REUTERS/Jorge Silva\nFifty people were wounded and 30 of them are in the Christchurch hospital, authorities said. Nine of them are in a critical condition. One four-year-old child was transferred to a hospital in Auckland in a critical condition.\nGUN LAW DEBATE RAGES\nThe gunman used a semi-automatic AR-15 during the mosque shootings, police said. A New Zealand gun shop owner said the store had sold Tarrant four weapons and ammunition online between December 2017 and March 2018, but not the high-powered weapon used in the massacre.\nArdern has said she supports a ban on semi-automatic weapons and that cabinet has made in-principle decisions to change gun laws which she will announce next Monday.\n\u201cPart of ensuring the safety of New Zealanders must include a frank examination of our gun laws,\u201d she said.\nWhile some New Zealanders have voluntarily surrendered guns, others have been buying more to beat the ban.\nA gun club in the northern town of Kaitaia burned down early on Tuesday and police were treating the blaze as suspicious.\nSimon Bridges, leader of the opposition National Party, said he wanted to get details of the changes to see if there could be bipartisan support in parliament. The Nationals draw support from rural areas, where gun ownership is high.\n\u201cWe know that change is required. I\u2019m willing to look at anything that is going to enhance our safety - that\u2019s our position,\u201d Bridges told TVNZ.\nArdern has said that Tarrant emailed a \u201cmanifesto\u201d to more than 30 recipients including her office, nine minutes before the attack but it gave no location or specific details. In the document, which was also posted online, Tarrant described himself as \u201cJust a ordinary White man, 28 years old\u201d.\nArdern was critical of social media platforms for allowing the distribution of hatred and division, including live broadcasts of the attack.\n\u201cWe cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published. They are the publisher. Not just the postman,\u201d she said.\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\u201cThere cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility. This of course doesn\u2019t take away the responsibility we too must show as a nation, to confront racism, violence and extremism.\u201d\nA consortium of global technology firms has shared on its collective database the digital fingerprints of more than 800 versions of the video of the mass shooting.\nAnyone caught sharing the massacre video in New Zealand faces a fine of up to NZ$10,000 ($6,855) or up to 14 years in jail.\nFacebook, the world\u2019s largest social media network, has said it removed 1.5 million videos within 24 hours of the attack.\nArdern said there would be an inquiry into what government agencies \u201cknew, or could or should have known\u201d about the alleged gunman and whether the attack could have been prevented.\nMore than 250 New Zealand police are working on the inquiry, with staff from the U.S. FBI and Australia\u2019s Federal Police joining them.\nPolice will be stationed at mosques around the country when they are open for prayers, and nearby when closed, said Ardern.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have seen in countries that know the horrors of terrorism more than us, there is a pattern of increased tension and actions over the weeks that follow. That means we do need to ensure that vigilance is maintained.\u201d",

CSIS/Beyond Parallel/DigitalGlobe 2019 via REUTERS</p>\n<p>Any new reprocessing activity would underscore the failure of a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in late February to make progress toward North Korea&rsquo;s denuclearization.</p>\n<p>Washington&rsquo;s Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report that satellite imagery of North Korea&rsquo;s Yongbyon nuclear site from April 12 showed five specialized railcars near its Uranium Enrichment Facility and Radiochemistry Laboratory.</p>\n<p>It said their movement could indicate the transfer of radioactive material.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In the past, these specialized railcars appear to have been associated with the movement of radioactive material or reprocessing campaigns.&rdquo; the report said. &ldquo;The current activity, along with their configurations, does not rule out their possible involvement in such activity, either before or after a reprocessing campaign.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The U.S. State Department declined to comment on intelligence matters, but a source familiar with U.S. government assessments said that while U.S. experts thought the movements could possibly be related to reprocessing, they were doubtful it was significant nuclear activity.</p>\n<p>Jenny Town, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said that if reprocessing was taking place, it would be a significant given U.S.-North Korean talks in the past year and the failure to reach an agreement on the future of Yongbyon in Hanoi.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Because there wasn&rsquo;t an agreement with North Korea on Yongbyon, it would be interesting timing if they were to have started something so quickly after Hanoi,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Trump has met Kim twice in the past year to try to persuade him to abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States, but progress so far has been scant.</p>\n<p>The Hanoi talks collapsed after Trump proposed a &ldquo;big deal&rdquo; in which sanctions on North Korea would be lifted if it handed over all its nuclear weapons and fissile material to the United States. He rejected partial denuclearization steps offered by Kim, which included an offer to dismantle Yongbyon.</p>\n<p>Although Kim has maintained a freeze in missile and nuclear tests since 2017, U.S. officials say North Korea has continued to produce fissile material that can be processed for use in bombs.</p>\n<p>Last month, a senior North Korean official warned that Kim might rethink the test freeze unless Washington made concessions.</p>\n<p>Last week, Kim said the Hanoi breakdown raised the risks of reviving tensions, adding that he was only interested in meeting Trump again if the United States came with the right attitude.</p>\n<p>Kim said he would wait &ldquo;till the end of this year&rdquo; for the United States to decide to be more flexible. On Monday, Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brushed aside this demand with Pompeo saying Kim should keep his promise to give up his nuclear weapons before then.</p>\n<p>Town said any new reprocessing work at Yongbyon would emphasize the importance of the facility in North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It would underscore that it is an active facility that does increase North Korea&rsquo;s fissile material stocks to increase its arsenal.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190416&t=2&i=1377661975&r=LYNXNPEF3F1NY\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (4 Images)</p>\n<p>A study by Stanford University&rsquo;s Center for International Security and Cooperation released ahead of the Hanoi summit said North Korea had continued to produce bomb fuel in 2018 and may have produced enough in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.</p>\n<p>Experts have estimated the size of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal at anywhere between 20 and 60 warheads.</p>",

CSIS/Beyond Parallel/DigitalGlobe 2019 via REUTERS\nAny new reprocessing activity would underscore the failure of a second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi in late February to make progress toward North Korea\u2019s denuclearization.\nWashington\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report that satellite imagery of North Korea\u2019s Yongbyon nuclear site from April 12 showed five specialized railcars near its Uranium Enrichment Facility and Radiochemistry Laboratory.\nIt said their movement could indicate the transfer of radioactive material.\n\u201cIn the past, these specialized railcars appear to have been associated with the movement of radioactive material or reprocessing campaigns.\u201d the report said. \u201cThe current activity, along with their configurations, does not rule out their possible involvement in such activity, either before or after a reprocessing campaign.\u201d\nThe U.S. State Department declined to comment on intelligence matters, but a source familiar with U.S. government assessments said that while U.S. experts thought the movements could possibly be related to reprocessing, they were doubtful it was significant nuclear activity.\nJenny Town, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Center think tank, said that if reprocessing was taking place, it would be a significant given U.S.-North Korean talks in the past year and the failure to reach an agreement on the future of Yongbyon in Hanoi.\n\u201cBecause there wasn\u2019t an agreement with North Korea on Yongbyon, it would be interesting timing if they were to have started something so quickly after Hanoi,\u201d she said.\nTrump has met Kim twice in the past year to try to persuade him to abandon a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States, but progress so far has been scant.\nThe Hanoi talks collapsed after Trump proposed a \u201cbig deal\u201d in which sanctions on North Korea would be lifted if it handed over all its nuclear weapons and fissile material to the United States. He rejected partial denuclearization steps offered by Kim, which included an offer to dismantle Yongbyon.\nAlthough Kim has maintained a freeze in missile and nuclear tests since 2017, U.S. officials say North Korea has continued to produce fissile material that can be processed for use in bombs.\nLast month, a senior North Korean official warned that Kim might rethink the test freeze unless Washington made concessions.\nLast week, Kim said the Hanoi breakdown raised the risks of reviving tensions, adding that he was only interested in meeting Trump again if the United States came with the right attitude.\nKim said he would wait \u201ctill the end of this year\u201d for the United States to decide to be more flexible. On Monday, Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brushed aside this demand with Pompeo saying Kim should keep his promise to give up his nuclear weapons before then.\nTown said any new reprocessing work at Yongbyon would emphasize the importance of the facility in North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\n\u201cIt would underscore that it is an active facility that does increase North Korea\u2019s fissile material stocks to increase its arsenal.\u201d\nSlideshow (4 Images)\nA study by Stanford University\u2019s Center for International Security and Cooperation released ahead of the Hanoi summit said North Korea had continued to produce bomb fuel in 2018 and may have produced enough in the past year to add as many as seven nuclear weapons to its arsenal.\nExperts have estimated the size of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal at anywhere between 20 and 60 warheads.",

                "text": "HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hailed \u201ca very special relationship\u201d with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they met in Vietnam for a second summit on Wednesday and said he was satisfied with the pace of denuclearization talks despite some criticism they were not moving quickly enough.\nThe U.S. president appeared upbeat with Kim even as on the other side of the world in Washington his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen called Trump a \u201cconman\u201d who knew in advance about the release of stolen emails aimed at hurting his Democratic rival in the 2016 election campaign.\n\u201cGreat meetings\u201d and a \u201cVery good dialogue,\u201d Trump said on Twitter after dinner with Kim at Hanoi\u2019s French-colonial-era Metropole hotel while the White House said the two planned to sign a \u201cjoint agreement\u201d after further talks on Thursday.\nFacing increasing political and legal pressure at home over investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, Trump has devoted significant time and effort to trying to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for promises of peace and development, a foreign policy goal that has confounded multiple predecessors.\nThe Hanoi meeting was Trump\u2019s second meeting with Kim in eight months and he appeared to reiterate recent statements that he was in no rush.\n\u201cWe had a very successful first summit,\u201d he told Kim. \u201cI felt it was very successful, and some people would like to see it go quicker; I\u2019m satisfied; you\u2019re satisfied, we want to be happy with what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nAsked by a reporter if he was \u201cwalking back\u201d on denuclearization demands, Trump said \u201cno\u201d.\nTrump and Kim held a 20-minute, one-on-one chat before they sat down to dinner with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Trump\u2019s acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Kim\u2019s top envoy Kim Yong Chol and North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.\nOn Thursday, the two leaders are scheduled for a series of meetings at the Metropole, beginning with another one-on-one session lasting 45 minutes, the White House said.\nThe two leaders would hold a \u201cjoint agreement signing ceremony,\u201d at the end of the meetings, which would be followed by a news conference by Trump at 3:50 p.m. Hanoi time (0850 GMT).\nThe White House has given no indication as to what the signing ceremony might involve, although the two sides have held discussions that have included the possibility of a political statement to declare the 1950-53 Korean War over, which some critics say would be premature.\nAsked if he would declare a formal end to the Korean War, which concluded with an armistice, not a peace treaty that North Korea has long sought, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\nTheir summit in Singapore in June was the first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader and ended with fanfare but little substance.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pose before their meeting during the second U.S.-North Korea summit at the Metropole Hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\nTrump and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean peninsula, but there has been little progress since. Kim said they had overcome obstacles to meet a second time and praised Trump for his \u201ccourageous decision\u201d to begin a dialogue.\n\u201cNow that we\u2019re meeting here again like this, I\u2019m confident that there will be an excellent outcome that everyone welcomes, and I\u2019ll do my best to make it happen,\u201d Kim said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very busy day tomorrow,\u201d a smiling, relaxed-looking Trump, said seated beside Kim at a round dinner table with the other four officials and two interpreters.\n\u201cOur relationship is a very special relationship.\u201d\nObservers said the pair were at pains to show their relationship had improved since June, with their body language closely mirroring each other.\nLEVERAGE\nTrump said late last year he and Kim \u201cfell in love\u201d, but whether the bonhomie can move them beyond summit pageantry to substantive progress on eliminating a North Korean nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States is the big question.\nTrump indicated a more flexible stance in the run-up to Hanoi, saying he was in no rush on denuclearization as long as North Korea, which has not tested a nuclear weapon or intercontinental ballistic missile since 2017, maintained that freeze.\nTrump risks squandering vital leverage if he gives away too much, too quickly, critics said.\nEvans Revere, a former U.S. negotiator with North Korea, said Trump was under pressure given his domestic problems and \u201cKim may be tempted to push Trump even harder for concessions, knowing how much the president wants and needs that testing pause.\u201d\nSlideshow (35 Images)\nDaniel Russel, who served as the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until early in Trump\u2019s presidency, said telling Kim that he could take his time was anything but strategically wise.\n\u201cThe yardstick for assessing ... results is not whether Trump proclaims himself \u2018happy,\u2019 but whether the outcome takes North Korea measurably closer to revealing and dismantling its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\u201d\nU.S. intelligence officials have said there is no sign North Korea will give up its entire arsenal of nuclear weapons, which Kim\u2019s ruling family sees as vital to its survival, and analysts say Pyongyang is unlikely to commit to significant steps without an easing of punishing U.S.-led sanctions.\nThe two sides have discussed partial denuclearization measures, such as allowing inspectors to observe the dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s Yongbyon nuclear reactor, U.S. and South Korean officials say.\nU.S. concessions could include opening liaison offices or clearing the way for inter-Korean projects.\nTrump has appeared to be betting on his personal relationship with Kim, and the economic incentive after 70 years of hostility between their countries.\n\u201cVietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize,\u201d Trump said on Twitter ahead of the meeting.\nFor live coverage of the summit, click: here; Eikon SUMMIT LIVE [nL3N20M1H6]; Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Jeff Mason in HANOI; Additional reporting by Hyonhee Shin, James Pearson, Mai Nyugen, Ju-min Park, Khanh Vu, Josh Smith in HANOI, David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in WASHINGTON; Editing by Robert Birsel, Lincoln Feast and Grant McCool",

While they also face possible jail time of 60 days to one year, it is not likely to be applied to first-time offenders, he said.\nKraft denies engaging in \u201cany illegal activity,\u201d according to Aaron Salkin, a spokesman for Kraft and the Super Bowl champion Patriots, the National Football League\u2019s dominant franchise.\nKraft and the other defendants were charged as part of a statewide probe into human trafficking, which Aronberg said was still underway.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\u201cThe larger picture which we must all confront is the cold reality that many prostitutes in cases like this are themselves victims,\u201d he said.\nThe NFL, which said last week it was monitoring the case, released a new statement on Monday saying everyone, including team owners, were bound by the league\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\u201cWe are seeking a full understanding of the facts, while ensuring that we do not interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe will take appropriate action as warranted based on the facts.\u201d",

Under that plan, the statement that homosexuality is at odds with Christianity would have been eliminated.</p>\n<p>The vote roiled many in America&rsquo;s second-largest Protestant denomination. Tom Berlin, a delegate, told Reuters that some supporters of the One Church Plan held small protest demonstrations afterward.</p>\n<h3>LOSE CREDENTIALS </h3>\n<p>&ldquo;This is devastating,&rdquo; Lucy Berrier said on Twitter. &ldquo;Above all, the United Methodist Church is supposed to be a place of grace and service, not this bigotry and hate. My heart is broken into a thousand pieces.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Berlin, who is a pastor in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Virginia, said with the new plan in place, some church members would risk losing their credentials to practice their belief in LGBT rights.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Some churches will begin to do what they desire. They will test this new legislation by performing marriages and some conferences will ordain gay clergy,&rdquo; he said in an interview after the final vote.</p>\n<p>At least 12 million people, including 7 million in the United States, belong to the United Methodist Church. A 2014 Pew survey found that 60 percent of U.S. Methodists said homosexuality should be accepted by society. About half of U.S. Methodists said they supported same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>The rift in opinion over gay marriage and clergy members&rsquo; sexual orientation is along geographic as well as ideological lines.</p>\n<p>Supporters of the Traditional Plan include many African and Philippine members as well as evangelical members from Europe and the United States. The One Church Plan derived most of its support from members in the United States who have witnessed a wave of social change regarding LGBT rights and awareness.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190227&t=2&i=1360775818&r=LYNXNPEF1Q01H\"></img></figure>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states in 2015. But the law does not apply to religious institutions.</p>\n<p>The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, remains strongly opposed to same-sex marriage. But a growing number of U.S. Protestant denominations allow gay marriage and clergy, including the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.</p>",

                "text": "(Reuters) - The United Methodist Church voted on Tuesday to uphold and strengthen its ban on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy in a move likely to alienate large numbers of followers who had pushed for reform.\nBy a vote of 438-384, delegates from around the world attending the church\u2019s General Conference in St. Louis reinforced a United Methodist Church policy established in 1972 stating that \u201cthe practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\u201d\nKnown as the Traditional Plan, the new policy includes penalties for breaking its rules and asks those who will not obey it to find another church.\nThe Traditional Plan is designed to serve as a coherent United Methodist Church policy on LGBT clergy and their marriage practices after years of inconsistency among individual United Methodist churches, with some churches denouncing homosexuality as a sin and others embracing gay and lesbian clergy members.\nBefore opting for the Traditional Plan, delegates rejected an alternative known as the One Church Plan, which would have allowed individual churches to decide whether to perform same-sex marriages and welcome gay and lesbian clergy members. Under that plan, the statement that homosexuality is at odds with Christianity would have been eliminated.\nThe vote roiled many in America\u2019s second-largest Protestant denomination. Tom Berlin, a delegate, told Reuters that some supporters of the One Church Plan held small protest demonstrations afterward.\nLOSE CREDENTIALS\n\u201cThis is devastating,\u201d Lucy Berrier said on Twitter. \u201cAbove all, the United Methodist Church is supposed to be a place of grace and service, not this bigotry and hate. My heart is broken into a thousand pieces.\u201d\nBerlin, who is a pastor in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Virginia, said with the new plan in place, some church members would risk losing their credentials to practice their belief in LGBT rights.\n\u201cSome churches will begin to do what they desire. They will test this new legislation by performing marriages and some conferences will ordain gay clergy,\u201d he said in an interview after the final vote.\nAt least 12 million people, including 7 million in the United States, belong to the United Methodist Church. A 2014 Pew survey found that 60 percent of U.S. Methodists said homosexuality should be accepted by society. About half of U.S. Methodists said they supported same-sex marriage.\nThe rift in opinion over gay marriage and clergy members\u2019 sexual orientation is along geographic as well as ideological lines.\nSupporters of the Traditional Plan include many African and Philippine members as well as evangelical members from Europe and the United States. The One Church Plan derived most of its support from members in the United States who have witnessed a wave of social change regarding LGBT rights and awareness.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states in 2015. But the law does not apply to religious institutions.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, remains strongly opposed to same-sex marriage. But a growing number of U.S. Protestant denominations allow gay marriage and clergy, including the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.",

The SEC called those tweets &ldquo;false and misleading&rdquo; and a go-private deal never materialized.</p>\n<p>As part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company&rsquo;s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.</p>\n<p>Tesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. Last week, Tesla unveiled its Model Y crossover SUV, targeted to begin production in 2020.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190319&t=2&i=1367829718&r=LYNXNPEF2I03F\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (2 Images)</p>\n<p>Musk called the regulator the &ldquo;Shortseller Enrichment Commission&rdquo; on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that &ldquo;something is broken with SEC oversight&rdquo; just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order.</p>\n<p>Legal experts have said the SEC could pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk&rsquo;s activities or removing him from Tesla&rsquo;s board or helm.</p>\n<p>Tesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla&rsquo;s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.</p>\n<p>A disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.</p>\n<p>The case is U.S. SEC v Elon Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:18-cv-8865-AJN-GWG</p>",

                "text": "(Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk has never sought pre-approval for a single tweet about Tesla Inc since striking a court-approved deal about how to communicate important information about the electric vehicle maker, the top U.S. securities regulator told a judge on Monday.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is doubling down on the government\u2019s demand to find the Tesla CEO in contempt of a previous fraud settlement that required him to have the company pre-approve any tweets that could materially impact the automaker.\nThe ongoing public battle between Tesla\u2019s chief executive and the SEC piles pressure on Musk, the public face of Tesla, who is struggling to make the company profitable after cutting the price of its Model 3 sedan to $35,000.\nThe SEC said a Feb. 19 tweet that Musk sent to his more than 24 million Twitter followers claiming the electric vehicle-maker would build around 500,000 cars in 2019 was \u201ca blatant violation\u201d of the agreement.\nThe SEC asked Tesla in late February whether any of Musk's tweets had been pre-approved since that policy was adopted, according to the filing bit.ly/2HsMiUr in federal court in Manhattan.\nTesla responded, after more than two weeks, to say simply: \u201cNo.\u201d\nFILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song\n\u201cIt is therefore stunning to learn that, at the time of filing of the instant motion, Musk had not sought pre-approval for a single one of the numerous tweets about Tesla he published in the months since the court-ordered pre-approval policy went into effect,\u201d the SEC said in the filing.\nThe regulator last month alleged that Musk had violated a September settlement of fraud charges by tweeting material information about Tesla without pre-approval from the company.\nIn response, Musk had argued that his \u201csingle, immaterial\u201d tweet was in compliance with the settlement, and that the SEC\u2019s push to find him in contempt infringed on his free speech.\nLawyers for Musk said the tweet complied with the company\u2019s communication policy for senior executives and was a \u201cproud and optimistic restatement of publicly disclosed information.\u201d\nThe SEC said in Monday\u2019s filing that the pre-approval policy agreed in the settlement was designed to include a wide variety of his comments, not just those that were deemed material by the regulator\u2019s standards.\nThe fraud settlement between Musk, Tesla and the SEC resolved a lawsuit brought by the regulator over claims Musk made on Twitter in August that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private at $420 per share. The SEC called those tweets \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and a go-private deal never materialized.\nAs part of that settlement, Musk stepped down as the company\u2019s chairman and he and Tesla agreed to pay $20 million each in fines.\nTesla has backed off a plan to close all its U.S. stores and said it will instead raise prices of its higher-end vehicles by about 3 percent on average. Last week, Tesla unveiled its Model Y crossover SUV, targeted to begin production in 2020.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nMusk called the regulator the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission\u201d on Twitter after the settlement, and tweeted that \u201csomething is broken with SEC oversight\u201d just one day after the agency started pursuing the contempt order.\nLegal experts have said the SEC could pursue multiple avenues, including a higher fine, imposing further restrictions on Musk\u2019s activities or removing him from Tesla\u2019s board or helm.\nTesla published a new communications policy in December for senior executives as part of the settlement. It called for Tesla\u2019s general counsel and a newly designated in-house securities law attorney to pre-approve any written statements about Tesla that could be material.\nA disclosure controls committee, made up of board members Brad Buss, Antonio Gracias and James Murdoch, was tasked with overseeing compliance with the new policy.\nThe case is U.S. SEC v Elon Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 1:18-cv-8865-AJN-GWG",

REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The bill passed 363-62, representing a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in Congress, with lawmakers eager to see money go to outdoors projects in their states. It permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created by Congress in 1964 but which has occasionally been allowed to expire, most recently last September.</p>\n<p>The Senate voted 92-8 earlier this month on the bill, and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it.</p>\n<p>Each year about $900 million in royalties paid by energy companies drilling on the U.S. outer continental shelf go to the fund that pays for items from improving ball fields to expanding national parks and wildlife refuges.</p>\n<p>Representative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the bill &ldquo;one of the biggest partisan wins for this country I&rsquo;ve ever seen in Congress&rdquo; and thanked Republican colleagues, including Representative Rob Bishop and Senator Lisa Murkowski for compromises on it.</p>\n<p>Trump is expected to sign the bill even though he has pursued a policy of energy dominance and opening public lands to coal mining and oil and gas drilling. His administration shrunk the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and has pushed to open part of Alaska&rsquo;s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</p>\n<p>The bill creates four national monuments, including the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home in Mississippi, and prevents industrial mining around others. Medgar Evers was an African-American veteran and civil rights leader who was assassinated in 1963 by a white segregationist.</p>\n<p>The legislation adds 1.3 million acres to U.S. wilderness preservation programs in California, Oregon, New Mexico and other Western states, and expands three national parks.</p>\n<p>Representative Don Young, a Republican, said he did not get everything he wanted in the bill, but added, &ldquo;This is the beginning of working together on public lands.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One lawmaker poured cold water on hopes of sustained bipartisanship on other environmental legislation.</p>\n<p>Representative Jeff Duncan, a Republican, called the Green New Deal resolution introduced by two Democrats, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, &ldquo;asinine&rdquo; and said it would jeopardize the conservation fund by leading a switch from petroleum to alternative fuels.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Tuesday easily passed a public lands bill on Tuesday, as the Senate did earlier this month, that permanently reauthorizes a fund that has funneled billions of dollars into land conservation, paid for by revenues from offshore oil and gas drilling.\nThe bill passed 363-62, representing a rare moment of bipartisan agreement in Congress, with lawmakers eager to see money go to outdoors projects in their states. It permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which was created by Congress in 1964 but which has occasionally been allowed to expire, most recently last September.\nThe Senate voted 92-8 earlier this month on the bill, and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it.\nEach year about $900 million in royalties paid by energy companies drilling on the U.S. outer continental shelf go to the fund that pays for items from improving ball fields to expanding national parks and wildlife refuges.\nRepresentative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat and chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, called the bill \u201cone of the biggest partisan wins for this country I\u2019ve ever seen in Congress\u201d and thanked Republican colleagues, including Representative Rob Bishop and Senator Lisa Murkowski for compromises on it.\nTrump is expected to sign the bill even though he has pursued a policy of energy dominance and opening public lands to coal mining and oil and gas drilling. His administration shrunk the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and has pushed to open part of Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.\nThe bill creates four national monuments, including the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Home in Mississippi, and prevents industrial mining around others. Medgar Evers was an African-American veteran and civil rights leader who was assassinated in 1963 by a white segregationist.\nThe legislation adds 1.3 million acres to U.S. wilderness preservation programs in California, Oregon, New Mexico and other Western states, and expands three national parks.\nRepresentative Don Young, a Republican, said he did not get everything he wanted in the bill, but added, \u201cThis is the beginning of working together on public lands.\u201d\nOne lawmaker poured cold water on hopes of sustained bipartisanship on other environmental legislation.\nRepresentative Jeff Duncan, a Republican, called the Green New Deal resolution introduced by two Democrats, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, \u201casinine\u201d and said it would jeopardize the conservation fund by leading a switch from petroleum to alternative fuels.",

REUTERS/Lawrence Hurley/File Photo</p>\n<p>But during a lively 70-minute oral argument in the major case about the separation of church and state, the justices appeared unlikely to issue a sweeping ruling allowing greater government involvement in religious expression.</p>\n<p>Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the court&rsquo;s four liberals, suggested a compromise ruling allowing the cross to remain based in part on the fact it was built in 1925 while making it clear that newly built religious symbols would be treated differently.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What about saying past is past ... but no more?&rdquo; Breyer asked.</p>\n<p>On one hand &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going to have people trying to tear down historical monuments,&rdquo; Breyer said. But on the other, &ldquo;we are a different country now&rdquo; that is more pluralistic, he added.</p>\n<p>The case, one of the most important of the court&rsquo;s current term, presented the justices with their latest test on the parameters for government-endorsed religious expression. A ruling is due by the end of June.</p>\n<p>The so-called Peace Cross, a concrete memorial to 49 men from Maryland&rsquo;s Prince George&rsquo;s County killed in World War One shaped like a Christian cross, is situated on public land at a busy road intersection in Bladensburg just outside Washington.</p>\n<p>Fred Edwords and two other plaintiffs filed a 2014 lawsuit challenging the cross as a violation of the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from establishing an official religion and bars governmental actions favoring one religion over another.</p>\n<p>On the bench, where conservatives hold a 5-4 majority, liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor appeared the most reluctant to find the cross constitutional.</p>\n<p>On the question of whether the cross should be retained because of its historic nature, Sotomayor pointed out that there are few large crosses on public land across the nation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a long tradition of that. It&rsquo;s sectarian,&rdquo; Sotomayor said.</p>\n<h3>A DOG&rsquo;S BREAKFAST </h3>\n<p>Fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan asked tough questions of the monument&rsquo;s supporters, at one point noting that the cross is &ldquo;the foremost symbol of Christianity.&rdquo; But at another point, Kagan appeared willing to compromise, based on the role of the cross as a war memorial. Aside from its shape, the cross has no other religious themes or imagery.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;So why in a case like that can we not say essentially the religious content has been stripped of this monument?&rdquo; Kagan asked.</p>\n<p>There appeared little appetite on the court for a broad ruling proposed by the American Legion, a veterans&rsquo; group that supports the cross, that would say that the government violates the Constitution only when it actively coerces people into practicing religion.</p>\n<p>Several conservative justices indicated they are not content with the court&rsquo;s current precedent that holds that mere government endorsement of religion is unconstitutional, but the alternative test suggested by the American Legion did not seem to appeal either. One of them, Justice Neil Gorsuch, described both approaches as a &ldquo;dog&rsquo;s breakfast.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Edwords, who is retired, is a long-time member and previous employee of the American Humanist Association, which advocates for the separation of church and state.</p>\n<p>The most steadfast supporter of the Maryland cross was conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who questioned the American Humanist Association&rsquo;s lawyer, Monica Miller, on the fate of other crosses on public land if she were to win.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you want them all taken down?&rdquo; Alito asked.</p>\n<p>The cross was funded privately and the property where it stands was in private hands when it was erected, but it is now on land owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a governmental agency.</p>\n<p>The cross has the backing of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration. The American Legion holds memorial events at the site. Veterans and their relatives have said the monument has no religious meaning despite being in the shape of a cross, calling the lawsuit misguided and hurtful.</p>\n<p>The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the cross unconstitutional, reversing a Maryland-based federal judge&rsquo;s decision. That ruling was appealed by the park commission and the American Legion, which is represented by the conservative religious rights group First Liberty Institute.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190227&t=2&i=1361017611&r=LYNXNPEF1Q1F2\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (2 Images)</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has sent mixed messages about limits on government-approved religious expression, including in two rulings issued on the same day in 2005.</p>\n<p>In one, it ruled that a monument on the grounds of the Texas state capitol building depicting the biblical Ten Commandments did not violate the Constitution. But in the other, it decided that Ten Commandments displays in Kentucky courthouses and schools were unlawful. Breyer was the decisive vote in both cases.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday signaled a willingness to let a 40-foot-tall (12 meters) cross-shaped war memorial stay on public land in Maryland despite a legal challenge that called it an unconstitutional government endorsement of religion.\nFILE PHOTO: A concrete cross commemorating servicemen killed in World War One, the subject of a religious rights case now before the U.S. Supreme Court, is seen in Bladensburg, Maryland, U.S., February 11, 2019. REUTERS/Lawrence Hurley/File Photo\nBut during a lively 70-minute oral argument in the major case about the separation of church and state, the justices appeared unlikely to issue a sweeping ruling allowing greater government involvement in religious expression.\nJustice Stephen Breyer, one of the court\u2019s four liberals, suggested a compromise ruling allowing the cross to remain based in part on the fact it was built in 1925 while making it clear that newly built religious symbols would be treated differently.\n\u201cWhat about saying past is past ... but no more?\u201d Breyer asked.\nOn one hand \u201cwe\u2019re not going to have people trying to tear down historical monuments,\u201d Breyer said. But on the other, \u201cwe are a different country now\u201d that is more pluralistic, he added.\nThe case, one of the most important of the court\u2019s current term, presented the justices with their latest test on the parameters for government-endorsed religious expression. A ruling is due by the end of June.\nThe so-called Peace Cross, a concrete memorial to 49 men from Maryland\u2019s Prince George\u2019s County killed in World War One shaped like a Christian cross, is situated on public land at a busy road intersection in Bladensburg just outside Washington.\nFred Edwords and two other plaintiffs filed a 2014 lawsuit challenging the cross as a violation of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from establishing an official religion and bars governmental actions favoring one religion over another.\nOn the bench, where conservatives hold a 5-4 majority, liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor appeared the most reluctant to find the cross constitutional.\nOn the question of whether the cross should be retained because of its historic nature, Sotomayor pointed out that there are few large crosses on public land across the nation.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a long tradition of that. It\u2019s sectarian,\u201d Sotomayor said.\nA DOG\u2019S BREAKFAST\nFellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan asked tough questions of the monument\u2019s supporters, at one point noting that the cross is \u201cthe foremost symbol of Christianity.\u201d But at another point, Kagan appeared willing to compromise, based on the role of the cross as a war memorial. Aside from its shape, the cross has no other religious themes or imagery.\n\u201cSo why in a case like that can we not say essentially the religious content has been stripped of this monument?\u201d Kagan asked.\nThere appeared little appetite on the court for a broad ruling proposed by the American Legion, a veterans\u2019 group that supports the cross, that would say that the government violates the Constitution only when it actively coerces people into practicing religion.\nSeveral conservative justices indicated they are not content with the court\u2019s current precedent that holds that mere government endorsement of religion is unconstitutional, but the alternative test suggested by the American Legion did not seem to appeal either. One of them, Justice Neil Gorsuch, described both approaches as a \u201cdog\u2019s breakfast.\u201d\nEdwords, who is retired, is a long-time member and previous employee of the American Humanist Association, which advocates for the separation of church and state.\nThe most steadfast supporter of the Maryland cross was conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who questioned the American Humanist Association\u2019s lawyer, Monica Miller, on the fate of other crosses on public land if she were to win.\n\u201cDo you want them all taken down?\u201d Alito asked.\nThe cross was funded privately and the property where it stands was in private hands when it was erected, but it is now on land owned by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, a governmental agency.\nThe cross has the backing of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. The American Legion holds memorial events at the site. Veterans and their relatives have said the monument has no religious meaning despite being in the shape of a cross, calling the lawsuit misguided and hurtful.\nThe Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the cross unconstitutional, reversing a Maryland-based federal judge\u2019s decision. That ruling was appealed by the park commission and the American Legion, which is represented by the conservative religious rights group First Liberty Institute.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nThe Supreme Court has sent mixed messages about limits on government-approved religious expression, including in two rulings issued on the same day in 2005.\nIn one, it ruled that a monument on the grounds of the Texas state capitol building depicting the biblical Ten Commandments did not violate the Constitution. But in the other, it decided that Ten Commandments displays in Kentucky courthouses and schools were unlawful. Breyer was the decisive vote in both cases.",

Picture taken March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder</p>\n<p>Now state regulators and health experts are investigating whether the contamination could reflect a much broader problem for farms that used similar methods to fertilize their land.</p>\n<p>The chemicals on Stone&rsquo;s farm likely came from biosolids, or nutrient-rich sewage from municipal utilities, that he spread across his fields, according to a report last year by Maine&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The chemicals are known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS &ndash; some of which have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems.</p>\n<p>The discovery of contaminated sites in Maine and around the country prompted Maine Governor Janet Mills this month to form a task force to study the extent of PFAS contamination and suggest protective measures. The state DEP says testing for the chemicals is underway at more than 95 sites.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Staff has been specifically working on identifying farms statewide that may have received sludge and identifying the original source,&rdquo; department spokesman David Madore said in a statement to Reuters.</p>\n<p>Patrick MacRoy, deputy director at the Maine-based Environmental Health Strategy Center, said the contamination at the Stoneridge Farm raises questions about the safety of biosolids used at farms nationwide.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Stone case is incredibly troubling because the source of exposure - waste sludge - is something that is also spread across hundreds of farms in Maine and thousands nationally,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Experts said that far more research is needed to determine how sludge-spreading programs may be contributing to contamination of groundwater, crops, or finished products such as milk.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe this one farm is an oddball in Maine, but without further testing, there&rsquo;s no way to be sure,&rdquo; said Michael Rainey, a former biosolids inspector at the health department in neighboring New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>Alan Bjerga, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, said that his organization believed the Stoneridge case to be an isolated event.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We see no wide threat to the milk supply,&rdquo; he said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Grease and water-repellent PFAS have been used for decades in cookware, specialty paper, fabrics, firefighting foam and other products. State and federal regulators have been scrambling to set safety standards for human exposure to some of the chemical compounds.</p>\n<p>Scores of lawsuits have been filed in pollution cases seeking billions of dollars from chemical manufacturers and industrial PFAS users. Two major cases have already settled in recent years for a combined $1.5 billion.</p>\n<h3>&lsquo;FOREVER CHEMICALS&rsquo; </h3>\n<p>Stone and his wife Laura Stone run the Stoneridge Farm on 100 acres of land in southern Maine, one of hundreds of small-scale dairy operations across the U.S. northeast prized for the quality of their milk, cream and butter.</p>\n<p>The Stones started spreading treated sewage in the 1980s as part of a state program that would help utilities get rid of the waste and fertilize pastures. They also used one delivery of sludge waste from a paper mill.</p>\n<p>Concerns about PFAS in the farm&rsquo;s milk first arose in 2016, when the local water district found the pollutants - often referred to as &ldquo;forever chemicals&rdquo; because they don&rsquo;t break down easily - in a well it maintained on the Stones&rsquo; land.</p>\n<p>Stoneridge informed its milk distributor, Oakhurst, and the state DEP. Additional tests found high levels of PFAS in Stoneridge&rsquo;s milk, soil, hay, and cow manure. The areas of highest soil contamination overlapped with where the sewer district sludge had been heaped, Stone said.</p>\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has said that biosolids spreading programs are active in all 50 states. In Maine, 66 sites are currently permitted for sludge spreading, according to state data.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190319&t=2&i=1368056140&r=LYNXNPEF2I0TF\"></img></figure>\n<p>Slideshow (27 Images)</p>\n<p>The numbers were higher during the years Stoneridge participated in the state-sponsored waste-spreading program, between 1983 and 2004. Data compiled in 2000 by the Toxics Action Network, an environmental group, showed that 226 sites, mostly farms, had sludge-spreading permits.</p>\n<p>Much of the regulatory push around PFAS so far has focused on water. In 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency set a lifetime &ldquo;health advisory&rdquo; for two of the compounds - PFOS and PFOA, which a growing body of research has linked to health problems. The EPA recommended that drinking water should contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of these chemicals combined.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no federal standard for safe levels in milk. But Maine public health officials said in 2017 that milk with PFOS exceeding 210 parts per trillion should be considered &ldquo;adulterated&rdquo; and banned from sale.</p>\n<p>So far, this ban has only affected Stoneridge, whose milk had levels as high as 1,420 parts per trillion.</p>\n<h3>FADING FAMILY TRADITION </h3>\n<p>Fred Stone, 63, fears he&rsquo;s nearing the end of a century-old family tradition. The contamination ordeal has already put him in $500,000 of debt, he said. He&rsquo;s considering selling some land and looking for a job.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;My grandfather, my father, and myself, we&rsquo;ve all been dairy farmers here,&rdquo; he said, wearing coveralls and mud-stained rubber boots as he walked the farmland his family bought in 1914.</p>\n<p>Until a few weeks ago, Stone was still trying to salvage his dairy operation. He purchased several dozen new cows, installed a $20,000 water-filtration system and stopped using his farm&rsquo;s hay for feed.</p>\n<p>The effort at first seem to work. Last year, test results on his farm&rsquo;s milk came back clean, and he was allowed to sell milk to Oakhurst again. But PFOS reappeared in the milk within months, causing distributor Oakhurst to permanently end its business relationship with Stoneridge.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When they dropped us, that was the end of our milk market,&rdquo; Stone said. &ldquo;So that was the end of us.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "ARUNDEL, Maine (Reuters) - For Maine dairy farmer Fred Stone, the discovery in 2016 that his cows were producing tainted milk has since brought financial ruin and threatened to shut down a century-old family business.\nDairy farmer Fred Stone watches the milk collected the previous day go down the floor drain, after discovering the soil, hay, and the milk from the cows on the farm contain extremely high levels of PFAS chemicals resulting from a 1980's state program to fertilize the pastures with treated sludge waste and making the milk unsuitable for sale, at the Stoneridge Farm in Arundel, Maine, U.S., March 11, 2019. Picture taken March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nNow state regulators and health experts are investigating whether the contamination could reflect a much broader problem for farms that used similar methods to fertilize their land.\nThe chemicals on Stone\u2019s farm likely came from biosolids, or nutrient-rich sewage from municipal utilities, that he spread across his fields, according to a report last year by Maine\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The chemicals are known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS \u2013 some of which have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems.\nThe discovery of contaminated sites in Maine and around the country prompted Maine Governor Janet Mills this month to form a task force to study the extent of PFAS contamination and suggest protective measures. The state DEP says testing for the chemicals is underway at more than 95 sites.\n\u201cStaff has been specifically working on identifying farms statewide that may have received sludge and identifying the original source,\u201d department spokesman David Madore said in a statement to Reuters.\nPatrick MacRoy, deputy director at the Maine-based Environmental Health Strategy Center, said the contamination at the Stoneridge Farm raises questions about the safety of biosolids used at farms nationwide.\n\u201cThe Stone case is incredibly troubling because the source of exposure - waste sludge - is something that is also spread across hundreds of farms in Maine and thousands nationally,\u201d he said.\nExperts said that far more research is needed to determine how sludge-spreading programs may be contributing to contamination of groundwater, crops, or finished products such as milk.\n\u201cMaybe this one farm is an oddball in Maine, but without further testing, there\u2019s no way to be sure,\u201d said Michael Rainey, a former biosolids inspector at the health department in neighboring New Hampshire.\nAlan Bjerga, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, said that his organization believed the Stoneridge case to be an isolated event.\n\u201cWe see no wide threat to the milk supply,\u201d he said in a statement.\nGrease and water-repellent PFAS have been used for decades in cookware, specialty paper, fabrics, firefighting foam and other products. State and federal regulators have been scrambling to set safety standards for human exposure to some of the chemical compounds.\nScores of lawsuits have been filed in pollution cases seeking billions of dollars from chemical manufacturers and industrial PFAS users. Two major cases have already settled in recent years for a combined $1.5 billion.\n\u2018FOREVER CHEMICALS\u2019\nStone and his wife Laura Stone run the Stoneridge Farm on 100 acres of land in southern Maine, one of hundreds of small-scale dairy operations across the U.S. northeast prized for the quality of their milk, cream and butter.\nThe Stones started spreading treated sewage in the 1980s as part of a state program that would help utilities get rid of the waste and fertilize pastures. They also used one delivery of sludge waste from a paper mill.\nConcerns about PFAS in the farm\u2019s milk first arose in 2016, when the local water district found the pollutants - often referred to as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t break down easily - in a well it maintained on the Stones\u2019 land.\nStoneridge informed its milk distributor, Oakhurst, and the state DEP. Additional tests found high levels of PFAS in Stoneridge\u2019s milk, soil, hay, and cow manure. The areas of highest soil contamination overlapped with where the sewer district sludge had been heaped, Stone said.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has said that biosolids spreading programs are active in all 50 states. In Maine, 66 sites are currently permitted for sludge spreading, according to state data.\nSlideshow (27 Images)\nThe numbers were higher during the years Stoneridge participated in the state-sponsored waste-spreading program, between 1983 and 2004. Data compiled in 2000 by the Toxics Action Network, an environmental group, showed that 226 sites, mostly farms, had sludge-spreading permits.\nMuch of the regulatory push around PFAS so far has focused on water. In 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency set a lifetime \u201chealth advisory\u201d for two of the compounds - PFOS and PFOA, which a growing body of research has linked to health problems. The EPA recommended that drinking water should contain no more than 70 parts per trillion of these chemicals combined.\nThere\u2019s no federal standard for safe levels in milk. But Maine public health officials said in 2017 that milk with PFOS exceeding 210 parts per trillion should be considered \u201cadulterated\u201d and banned from sale.\nSo far, this ban has only affected Stoneridge, whose milk had levels as high as 1,420 parts per trillion.\nFADING FAMILY TRADITION\nFred Stone, 63, fears he\u2019s nearing the end of a century-old family tradition. The contamination ordeal has already put him in $500,000 of debt, he said. He\u2019s considering selling some land and looking for a job.\n\u201cMy grandfather, my father, and myself, we\u2019ve all been dairy farmers here,\u201d he said, wearing coveralls and mud-stained rubber boots as he walked the farmland his family bought in 1914.\nUntil a few weeks ago, Stone was still trying to salvage his dairy operation. He purchased several dozen new cows, installed a $20,000 water-filtration system and stopped using his farm\u2019s hay for feed.\nThe effort at first seem to work. Last year, test results on his farm\u2019s milk came back clean, and he was allowed to sell milk to Oakhurst again. But PFOS reappeared in the milk within months, causing distributor Oakhurst to permanently end its business relationship with Stoneridge.\n\u201cWhen they dropped us, that was the end of our milk market,\u201d Stone said. \u201cSo that was the end of us.\u201d",

The field of candidates has since swelled, with 18 Democrats vying to win the party&rsquo;s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in November 2020.</p>\n<p>Sanders, of Vermont, benefited the most from small-dollar donors in the first quarter, with about 84 percent of his $18 million haul coming from individuals who contributed less than $200.</p>\n<p>Sanders also had the most geographic diversity in his donations, with California donors accounting for 27 percent of his donations of $200 or more. Less than 2 percent of his donations came from his home state.</p>\n<p>Warren - the only candidate to also swear off attending big ticket fundraisers - reported that about 70 percent of the $6 million she raised in the first quarter was from small-dollar donors. Massachusetts donors accounted for 25 percent of contributions over $200.</p>\n<p>Small-dollar donations can help catapult a candidate into the spotlight. Buttigieg until recently did not have a national profile, but raised $7 million during the first quarter of 2019 - of which 64 percent came from small donations.</p>\n<p>In a move to show they are serious about eliminating big money from politics, most Democratic presidential candidates have sworn off donations from corporate political fundraising committees. Some have nixed taking checks from registered lobbyists.</p>\n<p>The Democratic National Committee announced earlier this year that small-dollar, grassroots support will be one of the metrics it uses to determine who qualifies to participate in a series of nationally televised primary debates that will begin in June.</p>\n<p>Senator Kamala Harris had the second-largest Democratic fundraising haul, with 37 percent of her $12 million coming from small-dollar donors.</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Rourke reported that 59 percent of his $9.4 million was from donations of $200 or less. More than $2.1 million came from Texans who wrote checks of $200 or more.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, raised only 10 percent of his donations in $200 or smaller contributions. There was also little geographic variation among his contributors, with more than 60 percent of donations over $200 coming from his home state.</p>\n<p>U.S. Senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, each raised about 16 percent of their cash from small-dollar donors.</p>\n<p>Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg have sworn off corporate PAC money, but all raised heavily from people working in the technology industry. When looking by employer at their donors who contributed more than $200, all three raised more from Alphabet Inc Google employees than any other company.

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. Democrats emphasize building their 2020 presidential campaigns on grassroots support, fewer than half amassed at least 50 percent of their early financial backing from small-dollar donations, a Reuters analysis found.\nCandidates seeking the White House filed their first-quarter fundraising totals on Monday, revealing that many are still dependent on checks exceeding $200. Of the 15 Democrats who launched campaigns before April 1, only six amassed at least half their hauls from small-dollar donations.\nMany candidates are still leaning on donors in their home states for large checks. Nine Democratic candidates received the bulk of their contributions of $200 or more from their home states, the Reuters analysis found.\nEarly fundraising prowess can signal the strength of a candidate\u2019s campaign. Raising small checks from more donors can act as a test of popular support. Building a broad donor base that stretches beyond a candidate\u2019s home state can be evidence of gaining traction.\nMany Democrats have touted their support among so-called \u201csmall-dollar\u201d donors, those who give less than $200. But only six \u2014 U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders; U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren; former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard; and Andrew Yang, a former tech executive \u2014 are relying chiefly on those small-dollar donors.\nThe analysis includes fundraising reports covering the first three months of 2019 by the candidates who launched their campaigns prior to April 1. The field of candidates has since swelled, with 18 Democrats vying to win the party\u2019s nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in November 2020.\nSanders, of Vermont, benefited the most from small-dollar donors in the first quarter, with about 84 percent of his $18 million haul coming from individuals who contributed less than $200.\nSanders also had the most geographic diversity in his donations, with California donors accounting for 27 percent of his donations of $200 or more. Less than 2 percent of his donations came from his home state.\nWarren - the only candidate to also swear off attending big ticket fundraisers - reported that about 70 percent of the $6 million she raised in the first quarter was from small-dollar donors. Massachusetts donors accounted for 25 percent of contributions over $200.\nSmall-dollar donations can help catapult a candidate into the spotlight. Buttigieg until recently did not have a national profile, but raised $7 million during the first quarter of 2019 - of which 64 percent came from small donations.\nIn a move to show they are serious about eliminating big money from politics, most Democratic presidential candidates have sworn off donations from corporate political fundraising committees. Some have nixed taking checks from registered lobbyists.\nThe Democratic National Committee announced earlier this year that small-dollar, grassroots support will be one of the metrics it uses to determine who qualifies to participate in a series of nationally televised primary debates that will begin in June.\nSenator Kamala Harris had the second-largest Democratic fundraising haul, with 37 percent of her $12 million coming from small-dollar donors.\nO\u2019Rourke reported that 59 percent of his $9.4 million was from donations of $200 or less. More than $2.1 million came from Texans who wrote checks of $200 or more.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, raised only 10 percent of his donations in $200 or smaller contributions. There was also little geographic variation among his contributors, with more than 60 percent of donations over $200 coming from his home state.\nU.S. Senators Cory Booker, of New Jersey, and Kirsten Gillibrand, of New York, each raised about 16 percent of their cash from small-dollar donors.\nSanders, Warren and Buttigieg have sworn off corporate PAC money, but all raised heavily from people working in the technology industry. When looking by employer at their donors who contributed more than $200, all three raised more from Alphabet Inc Google employees than any other company. Sanders and Buttigieg raised more from people who were software developers or engineers than any other occupation.\nWarren, who has called for breaking up big tech companies, also raised from employees working at Yelp.\nDonors to five candidates - O\u2019Rourke, Warren, Harris, Gillibrand and Julian Castro, the former Housing chief - were more likely to be lawyers.\nThree candidates brought significant hauls from donors who listed their occupation as \u201chomemaker\u201d - Booker, Gillibrand and Gabbard.",

She spent about $566,000 on payroll taxes and $114,000 on health insurance.\nWarren has said she intends to build a \u201cgrassroots\u201d campaign. She has sworn off expensive fundraisers and is relying almost entirely on online donations to fund her campaign.\nBuilding a large campaign staff can create challenges. If a campaign begins to run short on cash, it is often more difficult to cut back on staff compared to trimming other expenses, such as advertising.\nWarren had 161 employees already on her staff by the end of the first quarter, according to the disclosures she filed. About half of the staff, her campaign said, are positioned in early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.\nBy comparison, Sanders\u2019 campaign had 86 people on its payroll by the end of the quarter, during which he spent $417,209 on salaries. Harris spent $477,108 on salaries on the 44 people she had on her payroll in the first quarter.\nWarren has also outpaced Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign hiring. Trump spent about $408,000 on staff in the first quarter, although the Republican National Committee is already working to help his reelection and has hundreds on staff.\nWarren isn\u2019t without cash to pay her employees - she raised $6 million in the first quarter and had an additional $10.4 million from her Senate campaign. She finished the quarter with $11 million in cash.\nHowever, her campaign disclosures revealed that she may be making tradeoffs.\nWarren spent about $905,000 on online advertising. Sanders spent about $1.6 million and Harris $1 million.",

REUTERS/Brian Snyder</p>\n<p>The United States denies nearly 4 million visa applications a year for a variety of reasons, including for practicing polygamy, abducting children or simply not qualifying for the visa in question. The data released Tuesday was the first comprehensive look at the human impact of Republican President Donald Trump&rsquo;s ban, imposed shortly after he took office and initially blocked by federal courts.</p>\n<p>The ban has especially affected people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, countries where the number of visas issued slid 80 percent in 2018 from 2016, the last year without a travel ban.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s initial January 2017 executive order banning entry to the United States by citizens of several Muslim-majority countries launched a fierce fight in federal courts over whether the policy amounts to an unlawful &ldquo;Muslim ban&rdquo; or is a legal exercise of presidential power.</p>\n<p>The administration revised the policy following court challenges, and the Supreme Court allowed it to largely go into effect in December 2017 while legal challenges continued. In June 2018, the high court upheld the new version of the ban.</p>\n<p>As a result, most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen have not been able to enter the United States for well over a year. Venezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the current policy, but those restrictions were not challenged in court.</p>\n<p>The figures released on Tuesday show the government denied 15,384 applications for immigrant visas - given to those who want to live permanently in the United States - due to the &ldquo;2017 Executive Order on Immigration.&rdquo; A State Department spokeswoman confirmed that term referred to the travel ban policy.</p>\n<p>In addition, 21,645 applications for non-immigrant visas - given to people coming for short-term visits for business, tourism or other reasons - were denied due to the ban.</p>\n<p>Approximately 2,200 visa applications overcame denials based on the travel ban last year, but it was unclear how many of those applications were initially made last year or earlier.</p>\n<p>The data did not include how many visa applications were made by citizens from countries affected by the travel ban.</p>\n<p>Every month, the State Department releases the numbers of visas issued to citizens of all countries, including those under the travel ban, but it does not publish equivalent monthly information on the number of visa applications or denials by country.</p>\n<p>Other, previously released data from the State Department shows that the number of U.S. visas issued to citizens of the countries under the travel ban has dropped drastically as a result of its implementation.</p>\n<p>In the fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - the five countries consistently on the travel ban list throughout its different iterations - received approximately 14,600 U.S. visas. That is down 80 percent from approximately 72,000 visas issued for citizens of those countries in the 2016 fiscal year, when no such ban was in place.</p>\n<p>The denials have affected people like Rasha Jarhum, a Yemeni human rights defender who applied for a U.S. visitor visa in October to attend events on women&rsquo;s rights.</p>\n<p>The U.S. consular officer &ldquo;refused to even take my passport to process anything,&rdquo; Jarhum said. The officer handed her a piece of paper citing the executive order as the reason for her visa denial, a picture of which Jarhum posted on Twitter.</p>\n<p>Ahmad Shariftabrizi, a U.S. citizen and oncologist in New York, is considering leaving the United States if his wife, an Iranian citizen, is unable to receive a visa to join him.</p>\n<p>The couple, who wed in 2017, applied for her visa that year, and she was denied in December 2018, he said in a phone interview. The U.S. government is now reviewing whether she is eligible for a waiver to the ban, which has been rarely granted.</p>\n<p>The uncertainty and distance is extracting a huge emotional toll on the couple.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The separation from my wife is making both of us break down psychologically,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely difficult.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department refused more than 37,000 visa applications in 2018 due to the Trump administration\u2019s travel ban, up from less than 1,000 the previous year when the ban had not fully taken effect, according to agency data released on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: International travelers (reflected in a closed door) arrive on the day that U.S. President Donald Trump's limited travel ban, approved by the U.S. Supreme Court, goes into effect, at Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nThe United States denies nearly 4 million visa applications a year for a variety of reasons, including for practicing polygamy, abducting children or simply not qualifying for the visa in question. The data released Tuesday was the first comprehensive look at the human impact of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s ban, imposed shortly after he took office and initially blocked by federal courts.\nThe ban has especially affected people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, countries where the number of visas issued slid 80 percent in 2018 from 2016, the last year without a travel ban.\nTrump\u2019s initial January 2017 executive order banning entry to the United States by citizens of several Muslim-majority countries launched a fierce fight in federal courts over whether the policy amounts to an unlawful \u201cMuslim ban\u201d or is a legal exercise of presidential power.\nThe administration revised the policy following court challenges, and the Supreme Court allowed it to largely go into effect in December 2017 while legal challenges continued. In June 2018, the high court upheld the new version of the ban.\nAs a result, most people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen have not been able to enter the United States for well over a year. Venezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the current policy, but those restrictions were not challenged in court.\nThe figures released on Tuesday show the government denied 15,384 applications for immigrant visas - given to those who want to live permanently in the United States - due to the \u201c2017 Executive Order on Immigration.\u201d A State Department spokeswoman confirmed that term referred to the travel ban policy.\nIn addition, 21,645 applications for non-immigrant visas - given to people coming for short-term visits for business, tourism or other reasons - were denied due to the ban.\nApproximately 2,200 visa applications overcame denials based on the travel ban last year, but it was unclear how many of those applications were initially made last year or earlier.\nThe data did not include how many visa applications were made by citizens from countries affected by the travel ban.\nEvery month, the State Department releases the numbers of visas issued to citizens of all countries, including those under the travel ban, but it does not publish equivalent monthly information on the number of visa applications or denials by country.\nOther, previously released data from the State Department shows that the number of U.S. visas issued to citizens of the countries under the travel ban has dropped drastically as a result of its implementation.\nIn the fiscal year from Oct. 1, 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen - the five countries consistently on the travel ban list throughout its different iterations - received approximately 14,600 U.S. visas. That is down 80 percent from approximately 72,000 visas issued for citizens of those countries in the 2016 fiscal year, when no such ban was in place.\nThe denials have affected people like Rasha Jarhum, a Yemeni human rights defender who applied for a U.S. visitor visa in October to attend events on women\u2019s rights.\nThe U.S. consular officer \u201crefused to even take my passport to process anything,\u201d Jarhum said. The officer handed her a piece of paper citing the executive order as the reason for her visa denial, a picture of which Jarhum posted on Twitter.\nAhmad Shariftabrizi, a U.S. citizen and oncologist in New York, is considering leaving the United States if his wife, an Iranian citizen, is unable to receive a visa to join him.\nThe couple, who wed in 2017, applied for her visa that year, and she was denied in December 2018, he said in a phone interview. The U.S. government is now reviewing whether she is eligible for a waiver to the ban, which has been rarely granted.\nThe uncertainty and distance is extracting a huge emotional toll on the couple.\n\u201cThe separation from my wife is making both of us break down psychologically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult.\u201d",

Alexandria Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Butina, 30, has been in custody since her arrest in July. She pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent for Russia.</p>\n<p>Robert Driscoll, Butina&rsquo;s attorney, told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in court on Tuesday his client is ready to be sentenced.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;From our perspective, we&rsquo;re ready to go,&rdquo; Driscoll said.</p>\n<p>Erik Kenerson, the lead prosecutor, said the prosecution still needs Butina&rsquo;s cooperation in its ongoing probe, but did not elaborate.</p>\n<p>Chutkan said she is sensitive to the defense&rsquo;s concerns, but agreed to postpone sentencing and hold a status hearing on March 28.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Ms. Butina has been detained for a substantial portion of what she would likely face,&rdquo; Chutkan said. But, the judge added that &ldquo;her cooperation continues to be needed by the government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The group Butina admitted to trying to infiltrate is the National Rifle Association, which has close ties to Republicans including President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The prosecution has indicated the involvement of others in the Butina case.</p>\n<p>Paul Erickson, a conservative U.S. political activist with deep Republican ties who was romantically linked to Butina, was referred in court records in the case as &ldquo;Person 1.&rdquo; Those records stated that &ldquo;Person 1&rdquo; helped advise Butina on which American politicians she should target for meetings.</p>\n<p>Erickson is well-known in Republican circles and previously served as a senior official in Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s 1992 presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Federal prosecutors in South Dakota this month said Erickson was indicted on 11 counts of wire fraud and money laundering in charges unrelated to those brought against Butina. But Erickson&rsquo;s indictment did appear to make a reference to Butina when it said he made a payment of $8,000 to an &ldquo;M.B.&rdquo; in June 2015 and another payment to &ldquo;M.B.&rdquo; in March 2017.</p>\n<p>The indictment said Erickson paid about $20,000 in June 2017 to American University in Washington, the school from which Butina obtained her master&rsquo;s degree.</p>\n<p>William Hurd, an attorney for Erickson, declined to comment when asked about the prosecution&rsquo;s request to delay sentencing for Butina.</p>\n<p>Alexander Torshin, who was a deputy governor of Russia&rsquo;s central bank and employed Butina as a translator and assistant, has been identified by her lawyers as a Russian official cited in court records. Torshin was hit with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions in April, but has not been charged in this case.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday agreed to delay the sentencing of Maria Butina, who has admitted to working as a Russian agent to infiltrate a gun rights group and make inroads with U.S. conservative activists and Republicans, at the request of a prosecutor who cited her ongoing cooperation.\nButina, 30, has been in custody since her arrest in July. She pleaded guilty in December to one count of conspiring to act as a foreign agent for Russia.\nRobert Driscoll, Butina\u2019s attorney, told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in court on Tuesday his client is ready to be sentenced.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, we\u2019re ready to go,\u201d Driscoll said.\nErik Kenerson, the lead prosecutor, said the prosecution still needs Butina\u2019s cooperation in its ongoing probe, but did not elaborate.\nChutkan said she is sensitive to the defense\u2019s concerns, but agreed to postpone sentencing and hold a status hearing on March 28.\n\u201cMs. Butina has been detained for a substantial portion of what she would likely face,\u201d Chutkan said. But, the judge added that \u201cher cooperation continues to be needed by the government.\u201d\nThe group Butina admitted to trying to infiltrate is the National Rifle Association, which has close ties to Republicans including President Donald Trump.\nThe prosecution has indicated the involvement of others in the Butina case.\nPaul Erickson, a conservative U.S. political activist with deep Republican ties who was romantically linked to Butina, was referred in court records in the case as \u201cPerson 1.\u201d Those records stated that \u201cPerson 1\u201d helped advise Butina on which American politicians she should target for meetings.\nErickson is well-known in Republican circles and previously served as a senior official in Pat Buchanan\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign.\nFederal prosecutors in South Dakota this month said Erickson was indicted on 11 counts of wire fraud and money laundering in charges unrelated to those brought against Butina. But Erickson\u2019s indictment did appear to make a reference to Butina when it said he made a payment of $8,000 to an \u201cM.B.\u201d in June 2015 and another payment to \u201cM.B.\u201d in March 2017.\nThe indictment said Erickson paid about $20,000 in June 2017 to American University in Washington, the school from which Butina obtained her master\u2019s degree.\nWilliam Hurd, an attorney for Erickson, declined to comment when asked about the prosecution\u2019s request to delay sentencing for Butina.\nAlexander Torshin, who was a deputy governor of Russia\u2019s central bank and employed Butina as a translator and assistant, has been identified by her lawyers as a Russian official cited in court records. Torshin was hit with U.S. Treasury Department sanctions in April, but has not been charged in this case.",

The two also chaired the 9/11 commission, which released the 2004 report delving into security failures before al Qaeda&rsquo;s 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon that killed almost 3,000 people.</p>\n<p>Task force members and foreign policy heavyweights from Congress discussed the report&rsquo;s recommendations for using foreign aid to stabilize fragile states, developing their economies to create jobs, fight corruption and alleviate underlying causes of extremism.</p>\n<p>The report was presented weeks before President Donald Trump is due to release his budget request to Congress. In his past two annual requests, Trump proposed - and Congress largely rejected - cuts of up to 30 percent in the amount of money sent abroad.</p>\n<p>The report presented on Tuesday did not take a political position. It was backed by influential foreign policy figures from among Trump&rsquo;s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats.</p>\n<p>Senator Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, said he was working to get the president&rsquo;s support for foreign assistance by convincing him the new approach would save money in the long run, after the country has spent trillions on military action since the 2001 attacks.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be a win-win in his eyes. You have to make more of a business case,&rdquo; said Graham, who chairs the Senate subcommittee that oversees foreign aid. He said he already had State Department support for the plan and would discuss the plan on Wednesday with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan.</p>\n<p>Representative Eliot Engel, Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike McCaul, its senior Republican, told the news conference they would reintroduce legislation that passed the House last year linking foreign aid to the fight against extremism.</p>\n<p>Graham and Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said they would also introduce the measure in the Senate with several co-sponsors from both parties.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Mueller handed in the keenly awaited report on his probe, the Justice Department said on Friday.</p>\n<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the presidential election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and damage the Republican Trump&rsquo;s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Russia denies it.</p>\n<p>Here are some key interactions between Trump advisors and Russian figures that have been unearthed by Mueller&rsquo;s probe and investigations in Congress.</p>\n<h3>TRUMP TOWER MEETING </h3>\n<p>Several top Trump aides, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr., met in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer who had offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. prosecutors said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was an agent for the Kremlin. The meeting was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist. Participants in the meeting said nothing improper occurred and that Veselnitskaya discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia and adoption policy, not election issues. The president said he did not know about the meeting beforehand.</p>\n<h3>EFFORTS TO BUILD A SKYSCRAPER IN MOSCOW </h3>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he pursued a deal to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow until June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen said in a guilty plea that he spoke with an assistant to Russian President Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s press secretary in January of that year and briefed Trump on the project more than three times.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the Moscow skyscraper talks continued until Trump won the November 2016 election but later said he misspoke.</p>\n<p>Trump, who repeatedly said during the campaign that he had no contacts with Russia, said after Cohen&rsquo;s guilty plea in November 2018 there was nothing wrong with pursuing the deal.</p>\n<h3>EFFORTS TO SET UP A MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LEADERS </h3>\n<p>Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos worked between March 2016 and August 2016 to set up a meeting with Russian leadership, according to prosecutors. They said a London-based professor with ties to the Russian government told him in April 2016 that Moscow had compromising information on Clinton.</p>\n<p>Papadopoulos served 14 days in prison after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about those efforts.</p>\n<h3>MANAFORT OFFERS CAMPAIGN INSIGHTS </h3>\n<p>Manafort shared election campaign polling data in August 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner who Mueller has described as having ties to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers. The two also discussed a plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, a major Kremlin foreign policy goal as it seeks relief from U.S. economic sanctions, according to court filings.</p>\n<p>Manafort, a veteran Republican political consultant who earned million of dollars working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, also offered private briefings about the campaign to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin, in an effort to collect past debts, according to the Washington Post.</p>\n<h3>ROGER STONE AND WIKILEAKS </h3>\n<p>Roger Stone, a veteran Republican political consultant who has worked on and off with Trump for decades, shared with Trump campaign officials advance knowledge he had of a plan by the WikiLeaks website to release emails stolen from the Clinton campaign by Russians, prosecutors said. The charging document mentions that a senior Trump campaign official &ldquo;was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information&rdquo; WikiLeaks had about the Clinton campaign, raising the possibility Trump himself made the request. Stone pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and witness tampering.</p>\n<h3>MEETINGS WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEI KISLYAK </h3>\n<p>Several Trump advisers met with Russia&rsquo;s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump became president.</p>\n<p>They included: Michael Flynn, who served as Trump&rsquo;s first White House national security advisor. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Kislyak in December 2017, after Trump won the election but before he took office. During those calls, according to the indictment, Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia and asked Kislyak to help delay a U.N. vote seen as damaging to Israel, a move that ran counter to the policies of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat.</p>\n<p>Jeff Sessions, a Republican U.S. senator serving as a campaign adviser who Trump later named attorney general, said he met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016 after initially telling Congress he was unaware of any communications between the campaign and Russia. As attorney general, Sessions recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, drawing the ire of Trump. The recusal by Sessions left Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, with oversight over the probe, which at the time was headed by the FBI. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to take over the probe.</p>\n<p>Kushner said he asked Kislyak if he could set up a secure communications channel at the Russian Embassy after Trump won the election. Kushner also said he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, during that period at Kislyak&rsquo;s insistence. Vnesheconombank has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014.</p>",

                "text": "(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other U.S. prosecutors have been investigating whether President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign conspired with Russia. Trump and Moscow have denied any collusion.\nMueller handed in the keenly awaited report on his probe, the Justice Department said on Friday.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia interfered in the presidential election with a campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and damage the Republican Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Russia denies it.\nHere are some key interactions between Trump advisors and Russian figures that have been unearthed by Mueller\u2019s probe and investigations in Congress.\nTRUMP TOWER MEETING\nSeveral top Trump aides, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr., met in June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York with a Russian lawyer who had offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. U.S. prosecutors said the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was an agent for the Kremlin. The meeting was arranged by Rob Goldstone, a British music publicist. Participants in the meeting said nothing improper occurred and that Veselnitskaya discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia and adoption policy, not election issues. The president said he did not know about the meeting beforehand.\nEFFORTS TO BUILD A SKYSCRAPER IN MOSCOW\nTrump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, said he pursued a deal to build a Trump-branded skyscraper in Moscow until June 2016, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination. Cohen said in a guilty plea that he spoke with an assistant to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s press secretary in January of that year and briefed Trump on the project more than three times.\nTrump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said the Moscow skyscraper talks continued until Trump won the November 2016 election but later said he misspoke.\nTrump, who repeatedly said during the campaign that he had no contacts with Russia, said after Cohen\u2019s guilty plea in November 2018 there was nothing wrong with pursuing the deal.\nEFFORTS TO SET UP A MEETING WITH RUSSIAN LEADERS\nTrump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos worked between March 2016 and August 2016 to set up a meeting with Russian leadership, according to prosecutors. They said a London-based professor with ties to the Russian government told him in April 2016 that Moscow had compromising information on Clinton.\nPapadopoulos served 14 days in prison after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI about those efforts.\nMANAFORT OFFERS CAMPAIGN INSIGHTS\nManafort shared election campaign polling data in August 2016 with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner who Mueller has described as having ties to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by Manafort\u2019s lawyers. The two also discussed a plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, a major Kremlin foreign policy goal as it seeks relief from U.S. economic sanctions, according to court filings.\nManafort, a veteran Republican political consultant who earned million of dollars working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, also offered private briefings about the campaign to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who is close to Putin, in an effort to collect past debts, according to the Washington Post.\nROGER STONE AND WIKILEAKS\nRoger Stone, a veteran Republican political consultant who has worked on and off with Trump for decades, shared with Trump campaign officials advance knowledge he had of a plan by the WikiLeaks website to release emails stolen from the Clinton campaign by Russians, prosecutors said. The charging document mentions that a senior Trump campaign official \u201cwas directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information\u201d WikiLeaks had about the Clinton campaign, raising the possibility Trump himself made the request. Stone pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and witness tampering.\nMEETINGS WITH RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR SERGEI KISLYAK\nSeveral Trump advisers met with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, before Trump became president.\nThey included: Michael Flynn, who served as Trump\u2019s first White House national security advisor. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Kislyak in December 2017, after Trump won the election but before he took office. During those calls, according to the indictment, Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia and asked Kislyak to help delay a U.N. vote seen as damaging to Israel, a move that ran counter to the policies of then-President Barack Obama, a Democrat.\nJeff Sessions, a Republican U.S. senator serving as a campaign adviser who Trump later named attorney general, said he met with Kislyak at least twice in 2016 after initially telling Congress he was unaware of any communications between the campaign and Russia. As attorney general, Sessions recused himself from oversight of the Russia investigation, drawing the ire of Trump. The recusal by Sessions left Rod Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, with oversight over the probe, which at the time was headed by the FBI. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, Rosenstein appointed Mueller as special counsel to take over the probe.\nKushner said he asked Kislyak if he could set up a secure communications channel at the Russian Embassy after Trump won the election. Kushner also said he met with Sergei Gorkov, the head of Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank, during that period at Kislyak\u2019s insistence. Vnesheconombank has been subject to U.S. economic sanctions since mid-2014.",

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque</p>\n<p>The division is unsurprising in Washington&rsquo;s bitterly partisan climate but raises a broader question: If the Senate intelligence panel cannot produce a consensus view of what happened with Trump and the Russians, what committee can?</p>\n<p>It would in turn stir doubts about whether congressional investigations into Trump will result in lawmakers trying to start impeachment proceedings against the Republican president.</p>\n<p>At least six congressional committees are probing whether Trump&rsquo;s campaign colluded with Moscow in its efforts to sway U.S. voters to support Trump in 2016; whether Trump has tried to obstruct investigations; whether his businesses have ties to Moscow; and whether he has used his office to enrich himself.</p>\n<p>The inquiries have months to go and much could change, especially with a long-running probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller not yet completed and many hours of congressional hearings, both open and closed, still to play out.</p>\n<p>But at the moment, sources said, Intelligence Committee members have been considering the production of dueling final reports, one from the committee&rsquo;s eight Republicans and one from its seven Democrats, reaching different conclusions.</p>\n<p>Congressional sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that both Republicans and Democrats on Senate Intelligence agreed there was a lack of direct evidence pointing to collusion. The two sides disagree on circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p>The Democrats say there is enough circumstantial evidence to support a finding of collusion in the committee&rsquo;s final report. Trump&rsquo;s fellow Republicans on the panel say there is not.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no hard evidence of collusion,&rdquo; a Democratic source said, but &ldquo;plenty of circumstantial evidence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Senate Intelligence oversees America&rsquo;s spy agencies, from the CIA to the intelligence-related functions of the FBI.</p>\n<p>Led by Republican Chairman Richard Burr, the panel&rsquo;s members also include Republicans Marco Rubio and Susan Collins, as well as Democrats Mark Warner, Dianne Feinstein and Ron Wyden.</p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for Burr declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Wyden, a senior committee Democrat.</p>\n<p>Burr told CBS last month that the committee, at that time, had found no proof that Trump&rsquo;s campaign colluded with Moscow.</p>\n<p>Trump denies any collusion occurred and has repeatedly blasted such inquiries as a &ldquo;witch hunt.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>DUELING REPORTS </h3>\n<p>If Senate Intelligence, and possibly other committees in Congress, end up producing conflicting reports, Americans looking to Congress for explanations about links between Moscow and the Trump campaign are likely to be disappointed.</p>\n<p>Moreover, experts said, such an outcome could reduce the odds of an eventual Trump impeachment. Under the Constitution, the impeachment process would begin in the Democratic-led House of Representatives, but it would fall to the Republican-led Senate to decide whether to remove Trump from office.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;This may indicate that Republicans don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a smoking gun, nothing that ties the president to a conspiracy,&rdquo; said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It leaves things with no impeachment, probably. ... If the Republicans are saying: &lsquo;Uh uh, this is not impeachable,&rsquo; then I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>Entrusted with some of the most sensitive U.S. secrets, Senate Intelligence began its Trump-Russia probe shortly after Trump took office. It is now moving to re-interview key witnesses, with senators joining staff investigators in the questioning for the first time, the sources said.</p>\n<p>The committee will assess a January 2017 report from the U.S. spy agencies that found Russia interfered in the 2016 election in various ways. Russia denies any meddling.</p>\n<p>Also being scrutinized by the panel are the role of social media in the 2016 campaign, the security of U.S. voting systems and steps former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s administration took - or did not take - after initial reports of Russian interference.</p>\n<p>But the central topic of the committee&rsquo;s probe will be the question of collusion.</p>\n<p>Bipartisan oversight on those questions is crucial, said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If there is a bipartisan report of the Senate Intelligence Committee, assuming it&rsquo;s a full exposition, that would make a difference, even if Burr and Warner had different interpretations,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Separate, partisan reports would tell a more familiar story, he said. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re back to the dynamic where Republicans will believe the Burr report, while Democrats, the mainstream media, the intellectual community and the Never-Trumpers are going to believe the Warner report,&rdquo; Ornstein said.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, known as perhaps Congress\u2019 most bipartisan panel, is split along party lines over whether Donald Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, sources told Reuters.\nFILE PHOTO: Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) arrives inside the Hart Senate Office Building before former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen testified behind closed doors before the committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 26, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\nThe division is unsurprising in Washington\u2019s bitterly partisan climate but raises a broader question: If the Senate intelligence panel cannot produce a consensus view of what happened with Trump and the Russians, what committee can?\nIt would in turn stir doubts about whether congressional investigations into Trump will result in lawmakers trying to start impeachment proceedings against the Republican president.\nAt least six congressional committees are probing whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow in its efforts to sway U.S. voters to support Trump in 2016; whether Trump has tried to obstruct investigations; whether his businesses have ties to Moscow; and whether he has used his office to enrich himself.\nThe inquiries have months to go and much could change, especially with a long-running probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller not yet completed and many hours of congressional hearings, both open and closed, still to play out.\nBut at the moment, sources said, Intelligence Committee members have been considering the production of dueling final reports, one from the committee\u2019s eight Republicans and one from its seven Democrats, reaching different conclusions.\nCongressional sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that both Republicans and Democrats on Senate Intelligence agreed there was a lack of direct evidence pointing to collusion. The two sides disagree on circumstantial evidence.\nThe Democrats say there is enough circumstantial evidence to support a finding of collusion in the committee\u2019s final report. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans on the panel say there is not.\n\u201cThere is no hard evidence of collusion,\u201d a Democratic source said, but \u201cplenty of circumstantial evidence.\u201d\nSenate Intelligence oversees America\u2019s spy agencies, from the CIA to the intelligence-related functions of the FBI.\nLed by Republican Chairman Richard Burr, the panel\u2019s members also include Republicans Marco Rubio and Susan Collins, as well as Democrats Mark Warner, Dianne Feinstein and Ron Wyden.\nA spokeswoman for Burr declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Wyden, a senior committee Democrat.\nBurr told CBS last month that the committee, at that time, had found no proof that Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow.\nTrump denies any collusion occurred and has repeatedly blasted such inquiries as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\nDUELING REPORTS\nIf Senate Intelligence, and possibly other committees in Congress, end up producing conflicting reports, Americans looking to Congress for explanations about links between Moscow and the Trump campaign are likely to be disappointed.\nMoreover, experts said, such an outcome could reduce the odds of an eventual Trump impeachment. Under the Constitution, the impeachment process would begin in the Democratic-led House of Representatives, but it would fall to the Republican-led Senate to decide whether to remove Trump from office.\n\u201cThis may indicate that Republicans don\u2019t think there\u2019s a smoking gun, nothing that ties the president to a conspiracy,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington.\n\u201cIt leaves things with no impeachment, probably. ... If the Republicans are saying: \u2018Uh uh, this is not impeachable,\u2019 then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said.\nEntrusted with some of the most sensitive U.S. secrets, Senate Intelligence began its Trump-Russia probe shortly after Trump took office. It is now moving to re-interview key witnesses, with senators joining staff investigators in the questioning for the first time, the sources said.\nThe committee will assess a January 2017 report from the U.S. spy agencies that found Russia interfered in the 2016 election in various ways. Russia denies any meddling.\nAlso being scrutinized by the panel are the role of social media in the 2016 campaign, the security of U.S. voting systems and steps former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration took - or did not take - after initial reports of Russian interference.\nBut the central topic of the committee\u2019s probe will be the question of collusion.\nBipartisan oversight on those questions is crucial, said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\u201cIf there is a bipartisan report of the Senate Intelligence Committee, assuming it\u2019s a full exposition, that would make a difference, even if Burr and Warner had different interpretations,\u201d he said.\nSeparate, partisan reports would tell a more familiar story, he said. \u201cThen we\u2019re back to the dynamic where Republicans will believe the Burr report, while Democrats, the mainstream media, the intellectual community and the Never-Trumpers are going to believe the Warner report,\u201d Ornstein said.",

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Mr. Whitaker for volunteering to meet with us to clarify his @HouseJudiciary testimony,&rdquo; Representative Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, tweeted, saying he hoped to schedule Whitaker in the &ldquo;coming days.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lawmakers have not said what Whitaker will address from his Feb. 8 testimony, which Nadler previously said was &ldquo;unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the most persistent questions then focused on whether Whitaker had contact with Trump about an investigation into hush-money payments to women during Trump&rsquo;s 2016 presidential campaign and Michael Cohen, Trump&rsquo;s former personal attorney.</p>\n<p>The Justice Department, which has already said Whitaker stands by his testimony, had no immediate comment.</p>\n<p>The brief tenure of Whitaker as head of the Justice Department ended on Feb. 14 when the Senate confirmed Trump&rsquo;s choice of permanent Attorney General William Barr.</p>\n<p>The Judiciary Committee has obtained possible evidence suggesting that Trump asked Whitaker about possibly changing the prosecutor in charge of the hush-money probe, said a person familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>A House Judiciary Committee spokesman and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney&rsquo;s office declined to comment.</p>\n<p>If true, such a request by Trump could bolster Democratic efforts to show that the president has sought to influence law enforcement investigations against him and his associates.</p>\n<p>Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to be close to ending a 21-month investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump; whether Trump&rsquo;s campaign colluded with Moscow; and whether Trump has since obstructed justice.</p>\n<p>Russia has denied meddling. Trump has denied any collusion. The Mueller probe has clouded his presidency for many months.</p>\n<p>Nadler&rsquo;s panel has information suggesting that Trump asked Whitaker if U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman could take control of an investigation of Cohen by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, said the source who asked not to be identified.</p>\n<p>Berman is a former law partner of another Trump attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump dismissed as false a report in the New York Times last week about a similar request to Whitaker.</p>\n<p>Congressional investigators now have information that such a request was made and that Whitaker provided misleading testimony to the panel while under oath during his contentious Feb. 8 hearing, the source said.</p>\n<p>In that session, Whitaker testified he had not talked to Trump about the probe and had not interfered with it in any way.</p>\n<p>He also denied media reports that claimed that Trump had lashed out at Whitaker after he learned Cohen was pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Nadler said then that media reports contradicted Whitaker&rsquo;s testimony and that &ldquo;several individuals&rdquo; had direct knowledge of phone calls Whitaker denied receiving from the White House.</p>\n<p>Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, including making payments to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen said he made those payments at the direction of Trump.</p>\n<p>Both women have claimed they had affairs with Trump. He has denied having sex with Daniels and denied McDougal&rsquo;s claim.</p>\n<p>Cohen testified behind closed doors to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. He is expected to testify publicly on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee.</p>",

                "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker agreed to meet with lawmakers to clarify his testimony, a congressional leader said on Tuesday, referring to an appearance where Whitaker was quizzed about whether President Donald Trump had sought to influence investigations.\nFILE PHOTO: Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker testifies before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Justice Department on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 8, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\u201cI want to thank Mr. Whitaker for volunteering to meet with us to clarify his @HouseJudiciary testimony,\u201d Representative Jerrold Nadler, chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, tweeted, saying he hoped to schedule Whitaker in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d\nLawmakers have not said what Whitaker will address from his Feb. 8 testimony, which Nadler previously said was \u201cunsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence.\u201d\nBut the most persistent questions then focused on whether Whitaker had contact with Trump about an investigation into hush-money payments to women during Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney.\nThe Justice Department, which has already said Whitaker stands by his testimony, had no immediate comment.\nThe brief tenure of Whitaker as head of the Justice Department ended on Feb. 14 when the Senate confirmed Trump\u2019s choice of permanent Attorney General William Barr.\nThe Judiciary Committee has obtained possible evidence suggesting that Trump asked Whitaker about possibly changing the prosecutor in charge of the hush-money probe, said a person familiar with the matter.\nA House Judiciary Committee spokesman and a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment.\nIf true, such a request by Trump could bolster Democratic efforts to show that the president has sought to influence law enforcement investigations against him and his associates.\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is said to be close to ending a 21-month investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump; whether Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Moscow; and whether Trump has since obstructed justice.\nRussia has denied meddling. Trump has denied any collusion. The Mueller probe has clouded his presidency for many months.\nNadler\u2019s panel has information suggesting that Trump asked Whitaker if U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman could take control of an investigation of Cohen by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, said the source who asked not to be identified.\nBerman is a former law partner of another Trump attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Trump dismissed as false a report in the New York Times last week about a similar request to Whitaker.\nCongressional investigators now have information that such a request was made and that Whitaker provided misleading testimony to the panel while under oath during his contentious Feb. 8 hearing, the source said.\nIn that session, Whitaker testified he had not talked to Trump about the probe and had not interfered with it in any way.\nHe also denied media reports that claimed that Trump had lashed out at Whitaker after he learned Cohen was pleading guilty to lying to Congress about a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow.\nNadler said then that media reports contradicted Whitaker\u2019s testimony and that \u201cseveral individuals\u201d had direct knowledge of phone calls Whitaker denied receiving from the White House.\nCohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, including making payments to adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Cohen said he made those payments at the direction of Trump.\nBoth women have claimed they had affairs with Trump. He has denied having sex with Daniels and denied McDougal\u2019s claim.\nCohen testified behind closed doors to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. He is expected to testify publicly on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee.",

REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton/File Photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Democratic Party leaders, who took control of the House in November, have recently stepped up pressure on Trump to release tax records from 2013 to 2018, which legal experts said could shed light on the president&rsquo;s business dealings.</p>\n<p>Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, which oversees tax matters, has given the Internal Revenue Service until April 23 to produce the documents.</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyer, William Consovoy, in a letter to the Treasury Department on Monday, accused Neal&rsquo;s committee of using its &ldquo;investigatory tools to unlawfully retaliate against a political opponent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lawmakers can go to court and ask a judge to force disclosure of the tax returns, but such a process could unfold slowly and become an issue in the 2020 election, legal experts said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I expect Trump will stall at every opportunity,&rdquo; said Steven Rosenthal, a tax lawyer with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, adding that &ldquo;delay is a victory for Trump.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Consovoy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>\n<p>A law from 1924 says that the IRS &ldquo;shall furnish&rdquo; any tax return requested by the chair of the Ways and Means committee.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If you look at the plain language of the statute, Neal is on strong footing here,&rdquo; said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>But this does not mean that Congress has unlimited power to request tax returns, experts said.</p>\n<p>If Congress invokes this statute, it must be acting with a legitimate legislative purpose, legal experts said, citing a 1957 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>In that decision, the Court said that Congress was not a &ldquo;law enforcement agency&rdquo; that can seek information to uncover crimes.</p>\n<p>Neal said in an April 4 statement that the documents will aid Congress in evaluating whether the IRS has been effective in enforcing tax laws against the president.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The IRS has a policy of auditing the tax returns of all sitting presidents and vice presidents, yet little is known about the effectiveness of the law,&rdquo; Neal said.</p>\n<p>Consovoy in Monday&rsquo;s letter said that &ldquo;no one actually believes&rdquo; Neal&rsquo;s &ldquo;invented&rdquo; reasons for wanting the tax returns.</p>\n<p>Ross Garber, a lawyer in Washington focusing on political investigations, called Consovoy&rsquo;s argument &ldquo;plausible&rdquo; and said it was possible a court would side with the president.</p>\n<p>Garber said Congress&rsquo; authority to request the documents would be stronger if it were conducting impeachment proceedings. Courts have held that Congress&rsquo; investigative powers are broader in the impeachment context, he said.</p>\n<p>But Edward Kleinbard, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California, said Neal&rsquo;s stated reason for demanding the tax returns &mdash; ensuring that tax laws are being enforced against Trump &mdash; was more than sufficient.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The integrity of tax system depends on peoples&rsquo; willingness to assess tax against themselves. The president of the U.S. is the taxpayer-in-chief, and he sets the standard,&rdquo; Kleinbard.</p>\n<p>Kleinbard, who formerly served as chief of staff to Congress&rsquo; Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that Trump was the first U.S. president in nearly 40 years who has not voluntarily released his tax returns to the public.</p>\n<p>Trump has said he cannot make the returns public because they are under audit.</p>\n<p>Kleinbard called that argument &ldquo;nonsense,&rdquo; saying nothing prohibits a person under audit from releasing his tax returns.</p>",

Courts have held that Congress\u2019 investigative powers are broader in the impeachment context, he said.\nBut Edward Kleinbard, a tax law professor at the University of Southern California, said Neal\u2019s stated reason for demanding the tax returns \u2014 ensuring that tax laws are being enforced against Trump \u2014 was more than sufficient.\n\u201cThe integrity of tax system depends on peoples\u2019 willingness to assess tax against themselves. The president of the U.S. is the taxpayer-in-chief, and he sets the standard,\u201d Kleinbard.\nKleinbard, who formerly served as chief of staff to Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, noted that Trump was the first U.S. president in nearly 40 years who has not voluntarily released his tax returns to the public.\nTrump has said he cannot make the returns public because they are under audit.\nKleinbard called that argument \u201cnonsense,\u201d saying nothing prohibits a person under audit from releasing his tax returns.",

Kai Landeros via REUTERS</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 22 ruled in favor of letting the Trump administration enforce its policy of barring many transgender people from the military. Implementation of the policy has been delayed by legal wrangling in a lower court case that the Supreme Court did not directly address.</p>\n<p>The high court&rsquo;s ruling and the President Donald Trump&rsquo;s policy have dismayed some transgender service members, such as Army Sergeant First Class Kai Landeros, 38. In the service since 2005 and twice deployed to Iraq, he is based at Fort Huachuca in Arizona,</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just disappointing,&rdquo; Landeros told Reuters.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You put forth your best effort every single day, something that you love doing and then to be told you shouldn&rsquo;t be in the military ... when you are fully capable and competent of serving. I don&rsquo;t see why there should be an issue,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>In the poll, conducted from Jan. 25 to Feb. 16, 59 percent of respondents said transgender people should be able to serve, while 24 percent said they should not. Of those in favor of service, 67 percent said the military should also provide medical care related to gender transition.</p>\n<p>The poll showed a partisan split, with 79 percent of Democrats in favor of transgender troops serving versus 38 percent of Republicans. Republican support has grown since 2017, when 32 percent backed transgender personnel.</p>\n<p>Trump in 2017 announced a plan to ban transgender people from the military, reversing Democratic former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s policy of allowing transgender troops to serve openly and get medical transition care.</p>\n<p>In March 2018, Trump backed a revised policy from then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. It banned, in some circumstances, transgender people with gender dysphoria, or distress due to internal conflict between physical gender and gender identity.</p>\n<p>The Mattis policy also banned transgender people who seek or have undergone gender transition steps. But it allowed people diagnosed with gender dysphoria during the Obama policy to stay in the military and serve according to their gender identity.</p>\n<p>After several federal courts blocked both versions of administration&rsquo;s policy as unconstitutional, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. It lifted lower court injunctions, but did not resolve the underlying question of the legality of the Republican president&rsquo;s plan.</p>\n<p>U.S. Navy Master-at-Arms Matthew McCarty, based at a Naval station in South Carolina and in the service since 2013, said Trump&rsquo;s ban came as a stab in the back. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re treating it like we&rsquo;re mutants and we&rsquo;re not able to serve just like everyone else next to us,&rdquo; said McCarty, 25.</p>\n<p>Asked for comment, a Defense Department spokeswoman defended the Trump policy, saying it is not a ban on transgender service members, but a policy on gender dysphoria.</p>\n<p>Congressional Democrats have condemned the policy as discriminatory. Wednesday&rsquo;s hearing of the Democratic-led House of Representatives Armed Services Committee will include the testimony of several transgender service personnel as well as members of the Trump administration including James Stewart, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.</p>\n<p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 8,823 adults online in English across the United States and it has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points.</p>",

                "text": "NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 60 percent of Americans said transgender people should be allowed to serve in the U.S. armed forces, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted ahead of a congressional panel\u2019s review, set for Wednesday, of Trump administration curbs on transgender service.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 22 ruled in favor of letting the Trump administration enforce its policy of barring many transgender people from the military. Implementation of the policy has been delayed by legal wrangling in a lower court case that the Supreme Court did not directly address.\nThe high court\u2019s ruling and the President Donald Trump\u2019s policy have dismayed some transgender service members, such as Army Sergeant First Class Kai Landeros, 38. In the service since 2005 and twice deployed to Iraq, he is based at Fort Huachuca in Arizona,\n\u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing,\u201d Landeros told Reuters.\n\u201cYou put forth your best effort every single day, something that you love doing and then to be told you shouldn\u2019t be in the military ... when you are fully capable and competent of serving. I don\u2019t see why there should be an issue,\u201d he said.\nIn the poll, conducted from Jan. 25 to Feb. 16, 59 percent of respondents said transgender people should be able to serve, while 24 percent said they should not. Of those in favor of service, 67 percent said the military should also provide medical care related to gender transition.\nThe poll showed a partisan split, with 79 percent of Democrats in favor of transgender troops serving versus 38 percent of Republicans. Republican support has grown since 2017, when 32 percent backed transgender personnel.\nTrump in 2017 announced a plan to ban transgender people from the military, reversing Democratic former President Barack Obama\u2019s policy of allowing transgender troops to serve openly and get medical transition care.\nIn March 2018, Trump backed a revised policy from then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. It banned, in some circumstances, transgender people with gender dysphoria, or distress due to internal conflict between physical gender and gender identity.\nThe Mattis policy also banned transgender people who seek or have undergone gender transition steps. But it allowed people diagnosed with gender dysphoria during the Obama policy to stay in the military and serve according to their gender identity.\nAfter several federal courts blocked both versions of administration\u2019s policy as unconstitutional, the government asked the Supreme Court to intervene. It lifted lower court injunctions, but did not resolve the underlying question of the legality of the Republican president\u2019s plan.\nU.S. Navy Master-at-Arms Matthew McCarty, based at a Naval station in South Carolina and in the service since 2013, said Trump\u2019s ban came as a stab in the back. \u201cThey\u2019re treating it like we\u2019re mutants and we\u2019re not able to serve just like everyone else next to us,\u201d said McCarty, 25.\nAsked for comment, a Defense Department spokeswoman defended the Trump policy, saying it is not a ban on transgender service members, but a policy on gender dysphoria.\nCongressional Democrats have condemned the policy as discriminatory. Wednesday\u2019s hearing of the Democratic-led House of Representatives Armed Services Committee will include the testimony of several transgender service personnel as well as members of the Trump administration including James Stewart, the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 8,823 adults online in English across the United States and it has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points.",

Members of the National Guard and local rescuers used helicopters, boats and high-clearance vehicles to reach about 60 people who stayed behind and needed help, said Barry Dugan, a spokesman for the Sonoma County emergency operations center.</p>\n<p>Guerneville, a community of more than 4,500 people that is the largest town in the flood zone, was cut off from other areas by inundated roadways, the Sonoma County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said on Twitter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here 30 years. I&rsquo;ve never seen it rain so hard,&rdquo; said Brian Gipson, director of marketing at the Farmhouse Inn hotel near Guerneville, which evacuated guests after water flooded its car park a third of a mile from the river.</p>\n<p>The evacuation orders affected about two dozen communities stretching dozens of miles along the river.</p>\n<p>The Russian River rose to more than 45 feet (13.7 meters) late on Wednesday, well over flood stage of 32 feet (9.8 meters), Dugan said. The river was expected to fall below flood stage at the end of Thursday.</p>\n<p>The flooding was the worst since 1995, when the Russian River rose to 48 feet (14.6 meters), said National Weather Service meteorologist Carolina Walbrun. The latest inundation was caused by a so-called atmospheric river of moisture from the Pacific Ocean stalling over the region.</p>\n<p>The Sonoma County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office showed video on the department&rsquo;s Facebook page of brown, muddy water rising above a road and flooding homes.</p>\n<p>The flooding has not caused any deaths or injuries, Dugan said.</p>\n<p>The estimate of about 2,000 homes and businesses flooded in the area is a preliminary assessment, Dugan said. After waters recede, authorities plan to allow evacuated residents to return to homes and businesses to assess the damage.</p>\n<p>Sonoma County officials have asked California Governor Gavin Newsom to declare an emergency in the area to help with recovery.</p>\n<p>Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Additional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York and Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Leslie Adler, James Dalgleish and Raissa Kasolowsky</p>",

                "text": "LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A rain-swollen river in Northern California flooded about 2,000 homes and businesses on Wednesday along a valley famous for its wineries and left residents of one town stranded by high waters, officials said.\nWater rose to the roofs of homes and submerged cars as the Russian River overflowed its banks, forcing authorities in Sonoma County, about 70 miles (110 km) north of San Francisco, to order the evacuation of 3,600 people, local authorities said.\nResidents got around flooded towns in kayaks, an indication that not everyone evacuated. Members of the National Guard and local rescuers used helicopters, boats and high-clearance vehicles to reach about 60 people who stayed behind and needed help, said Barry Dugan, a spokesman for the Sonoma County emergency operations center.\nGuerneville, a community of more than 4,500 people that is the largest town in the flood zone, was cut off from other areas by inundated roadways, the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office said on Twitter.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen it rain so hard,\u201d said Brian Gipson, director of marketing at the Farmhouse Inn hotel near Guerneville, which evacuated guests after water flooded its car park a third of a mile from the river.\nThe evacuation orders affected about two dozen communities stretching dozens of miles along the river.\nThe Russian River rose to more than 45 feet (13.7 meters) late on Wednesday, well over flood stage of 32 feet (9.8 meters), Dugan said. The river was expected to fall below flood stage at the end of Thursday.\nThe flooding was the worst since 1995, when the Russian River rose to 48 feet (14.6 meters), said National Weather Service meteorologist Carolina Walbrun. The latest inundation was caused by a so-called atmospheric river of moisture from the Pacific Ocean stalling over the region.\nThe Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office showed video on the department\u2019s Facebook page of brown, muddy water rising above a road and flooding homes.\nThe flooding has not caused any deaths or injuries, Dugan said.\nThe estimate of about 2,000 homes and businesses flooded in the area is a preliminary assessment, Dugan said. After waters recede, authorities plan to allow evacuated residents to return to homes and businesses to assess the damage.\nSonoma County officials have asked California Governor Gavin Newsom to declare an emergency in the area to help with recovery.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Additional reporting by Peter Szekely in New York and Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Leslie Adler, James Dalgleish and Raissa Kasolowsky",
