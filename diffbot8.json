Hirono refused to acknowledge the question and a member of her staff told TheDCNF \u201cwe don\u2019t talk to you, I don\u2019t know why you keep asking.\u201d\nJones told TheDCNF he is \u201cnot going to answer abortion questions,\u201d saying, \u201cI\u2019m just not going to answer. You can talk to my communications director.\u201d (RELATED: Here Are The Three Democrats Who Voted Against Infanticide)\nDemocratic Connecticut Sen. Dick Blumenthal responded to a question about whether abortion could in any way be immoral.\n\u201cI have to think about that.\u201d\nWhen TheDCNF reminded Blumenthal he voted in favor of a bill that supports abortion, he said, \u201clet me think about that and I\u2019ll get back to you. Do you have a card?\u201d\nTheDCNF ran into Blumenthal on Wednesday and reminded him of the question, asking if he had thought about it.\n\u201cI can think of instances where it might be,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if it is performed with criminal intent. If there is criminal intent or, in fact, intent to harm another person, I can see how that might be immoral.\u201d\nDemocratic Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine was the only Democrat asked who said there were cases in which abortion could be immoral, saying he has \u201csupported all kinds of regulations that I think are completely consistent with Roe v. Wade. So, yeah \u2014 many over the course of my career.\u201d\nHowever, he did not vote in favor of Sasse\u2019s bill Monday night.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 hopeful, ran away from TheDCNF\u2019s question Wednesday, sprinting down Senate escalators and into the Senate subway, while refusing to answer the question as the subway doors closed.\n\u201cThe Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don\u2019t mind executing babies AFTER birth,\u201d Trump said Monday.\nWyatt Dobrovich and Connor Moldo contributed to this report.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We are a different country now, and there are more than 50 different religions.\u201d\nA divided three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the memorial violates the Constitution, over a dissent that feared the ruling would prompt the removal of crosses from Arlington National Cemetery, which sits in the 4th Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction.\nThe case arose in 2014, when three Maryland residents sued the parks commission with the support of the American Humanist Association (AHA). The plaintiffs say that the Peace Cross violates the First Amendment\u2019s ban on religious favoritism.\nThe Legion intervened in the case given its historical connection to the monument. The Legion and other veterans groups still host annual programs at the Peace Cross.\nSpeaking outside the Supreme Court after Wednesday\u2019s argument, the Legion\u2019s national judge advocate expressed regret that the justices needed to hear the case at all.\n\u201cThis memorial honors and remembers those 49 heroes that died for our freedom,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cWe feel terrible that we have to be here. When we signed up to go into the service nobody asked what our religion was. We went in and did our job just like those men.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep honoring them just like we need to honor all of our memorials,\u201d he added.\nAlec Schemmel contributed to this report.\nSend tips to kevin@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Lee Zeldin is criticizing Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar on Wednesday for saying that she began her term in the House trying to fight against anti-Semitism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/ilhan-omar-congress-interview-797220/\">Rolling Stone</a> released a profile on the congresswoman Wednesday. During the interview, which was done prior to her accusing AIPAC of buying congressional support, Omar was asked about previous statements she&rsquo;s made about Israel, which she has since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1095046561254567937\">apologized</a> for. <strong><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/11/omar-israel-aipac-lobbyist/\">(RELATED: Omar Releases Statement After Backlash Surrounding Tweet Accusing AIPAC Of Buying Israel Support)</a></strong></p>\n<p>&ldquo;I hope people understand how deeply I care about creating that world,&rdquo; Omar stated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why one of the first things I did as a member-elect was to speak about the rise of anti-Semitism &mdash; and one of the first bills I cosponsored as a new member was legislation to elevate the position of a <a href=\"https://schneider.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-passes-schneider-smith-led-bill-fill-special-envoy-monitor-and-combat\">Special Envoy to combat anti-Semitism</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Omar&rsquo;s spokesperson pointed The Daily Caller to a press release about her vote on the Special Envoy position and to an <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/rep-elect-ilhan-omar-let-us-stand-together-as-americans-in-rejecting-hate/501287251/\">op-ed she wrote in the Star Tribune</a> in November discussing the rise in hate crimes, when asked if she could expound on how she&rsquo;s helping combat anti-Semitism.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4484px) 100vw, 4484px\" src=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1094676868-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1094676868-2.jpg 4484w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1094676868-2-180x120.jpg 180w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1094676868-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-1094676868-2-620x413.jpg 620w\"></img><figcaption>WASHINGTON, DC &ndash; JANUARY 15: U.S. Rep Ilhan Omar (D-MN)speaks to media outside the US Captiol on January 15, 2019 in Washington, DC.

Zeldin and Omar have sparred on Twitter on numerous occasions. <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/03/zeldin-israel-bds-omar/\">Zeldin has repeatedly condemned Omar</a> for her support of the BDS movement and the Democrats for placing her on the Foreign Affairs Committee, while Omar has accused him of being a bully. <strong><a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/03/zeldin-israel-bds-omar/%E2%80%98I%20Wish%20Hitler%20Would%E2%80%99ve%20Done%20His%20F***ing%20Job%E2%80%99:%20Congressman%20Zeldin%20Releases%20Anti-Semitic%20Voicemail%20He%20Received\">(RELATED: I Wish Hitler Would&rsquo;ve Done His F***ing Job&rsquo;: Congressman Zeldin Releases Anti-Semitic Voicemail He Received)</a></strong></p>\n<p>He told the Caller:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One of the first things she did as a Member of Congress was continue her history of peddling anti-Semitic tropes, building on her statement that Israel has hypnotized the world by claiming those who support Israel were paid off by Jews. Perhaps, her inability to justify these anti-Semitic statements is why she declined to explain them in Rolling Stone&rsquo;s request for a follow-up interview. For this reason and many others, she should not be serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House should immediately pass H. Res. 72, condemning the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate rising in the United States and around the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Republican Jewish Committee has also criticized Omar for some of her comments about the <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/31/jewish-conservative-omar-israel-democracy/\">Israel-Palestine conflict</a>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We disagree with the sentiment that she somehow stands up against anti-Semitism. She has said blatantly anti-Semitic things, and she continues to say them even after being elected,&rdquo; RJC national spokesman Neil Strauss told the Caller. &ldquo;She supports the anti-Semitic BDS movement. No matter what votes she&rsquo;s cast, there&rsquo;s no escaping that she is an anti-Semite.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Despite her statement, Omar has been tied to anti-Semitism throughout her tenure. She has announced her support for the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/boycott-divestment-sanctions-movement-bds\">(BDS) movement</a>, which some consider to be anti-Semitic. Omar also previously implied that <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/30/omar-israel-democracy-palestine/\">Israel is not a democracy</a> and, back in 2012, accused Israel of &ldquo;[hypnotizing] the world,&rdquo; although she has since <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/02/26/omar-israel-palestine-twitter/\">deleted the tweet</a>.</p>",

                "text": "Republican New York Rep. Lee Zeldin is criticizing Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar on Wednesday for saying that she began her term in the House trying to fight against anti-Semitism.\nRolling Stone released a profile on the congresswoman Wednesday. During the interview, which was done prior to her accusing AIPAC of buying congressional support, Omar was asked about previous statements she\u2019s made about Israel, which she has since apologized for. (RELATED: Omar Releases Statement After Backlash Surrounding Tweet Accusing AIPAC Of Buying Israel Support)\n\u201cI hope people understand how deeply I care about creating that world,\u201d Omar stated. \u201cThat\u2019s why one of the first things I did as a member-elect was to speak about the rise of anti-Semitism \u2014 and one of the first bills I cosponsored as a new member was legislation to elevate the position of a Special Envoy to combat anti-Semitism.\u201d\nOmar\u2019s spokesperson pointed The Daily Caller to a press release about her vote on the Special Envoy position and to an op-ed she wrote in the Star Tribune in November discussing the rise in hate crimes, when asked if she could expound on how she\u2019s helping combat anti-Semitism.\nOmar has also faced off with conservatives over other remarks about Israel. Zeldin and Omar have sparred on Twitter on numerous occasions. Zeldin has repeatedly condemned Omar for her support of the BDS movement and the Democrats for placing her on the Foreign Affairs Committee, while Omar has accused him of being a bully. (RELATED: I Wish Hitler Would\u2019ve Done His F***ing Job\u2019: Congressman Zeldin Releases Anti-Semitic Voicemail He Received)\nHe told the Caller:\nOne of the first things she did as a Member of Congress was continue her history of peddling anti-Semitic tropes, building on her statement that Israel has hypnotized the world by claiming those who support Israel were paid off by Jews. Perhaps, her inability to justify these anti-Semitic statements is why she declined to explain them in Rolling Stone\u2019s request for a follow-up interview. For this reason and many others, she should not be serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House should immediately pass H. Res. 72, condemning the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate rising in the United States and around the world.\nThe Republican Jewish Committee has also criticized Omar for some of her comments about the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\u201cWe disagree with the sentiment that she somehow stands up against anti-Semitism. She has said blatantly anti-Semitic things, and she continues to say them even after being elected,\u201d RJC national spokesman Neil Strauss told the Caller. \u201cShe supports the anti-Semitic BDS movement. No matter what votes she\u2019s cast, there\u2019s no escaping that she is an anti-Semite.\u201d\nDespite her statement, Omar has been tied to anti-Semitism throughout her tenure. She has announced her support for the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which some consider to be anti-Semitic. Omar also previously implied that Israel is not a democracy and, back in 2012, accused Israel of \u201c[hypnotizing] the world,\u201d although she has since deleted the tweet.",

                "text": "Congress tried to veto reality.\nInstead, President Trump vetoed Congress.\nWhen Congress voted to block President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration on the southern border, the president vetoed their measure.\nNo matter how hard Congress tries to ignore, deny and dodge reality, we have a humanitarian, security and enforcement crisis at the border. As Homeland Security Secretary Kirsten Nielsen said, it is beyond a national emergency \u2014 it\u2019s a total meltdown of our immigration system.\nSadly, their willful ignorance, ideological blindfold and hatred of President Trump prevent Congress from acknowledging it.\nIllegal immigrant apprehensions on our southern border are at the highest level in a decade. But even that statistic doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nThe number of migrant families with young children is higher than ever. In the first five months of this year, over 136 thousand were apprehended \u2014 that\u2019s almost a third higher than were apprehended all of last year. (RELATED: Guilfoyle: President Trump\u2019s State Of The Union Was A Grand Slam)\nHuman traffickers have put the word out in Central America that bringing a child provides a free pass to enter our country. Business is so brisk smugglers are now offering a volume discount and using luxury express buses to take migrants from Guatemala to the U.S. with children traveling free, the Washington Post reports.\nOnce at the frontier, migrants don\u2019t try to evade the Border Patrol. They willingly surrender, often in groups of a hundred or more, lining up in an orderly fashion as if they were entering our country legally.\nSo far this year, over 268,000 immigrants were apprehended on our southwestern border. Another 100,000 could cross in March. On one night alone in early March, agents took in 700 migrants just in El Paso.\nAt the current rate, one million of the poorest people on Earth could show up at the Rio Grande this year. Once they are released into our country, as courts dictate, they will compete against the most vulnerable Americans for jobs on the lowest rung of the economic ladder.\nMany of the arriving migrants have medical issues and require emergency care. Kevin K. McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, sayson a typical day the United States Border Patrol refers 50 individuals to a hospital or medical provider. All children receive medical screening.\nAs a former prosecutor who fought for justice for women and children who were victims of sexual assault, it gives me chills when I hear CBP must screen every female over 10 years of age for rape. Doctors Without Borders reports more than 30 percent of women migrants it interviewed are sexually assaulted on the way north.\nAt the same time Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer deny there is an emergency at the border, they asked for nearly a half billion dollars from taxpayers to provide medical care and food for illegal immigrants showing up at the border. (RELATED: Guilfoyle: Americans Can Have A Merry Christmas Thanks To President Trump)\nBut there\u2019s more to the emergency than migrants. The same criminal gangs that traffic people also traffic drugs. They will use migrants to divert Border Patrol agents in order to bring drugs across.\nDrug overdoses are now the number one cause of death for Americans under the age of 55.\nOver 70,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017. The Centers for Disease Control reports the sharpest increase in deaths came from fentanyl, cheap synthetic heroin that is flooding our country.\nFentanyl is made in China and smuggled into America by Mexican cartels. One load of fentanyl seized by customs agents on the Mexican border in January was enough to kill more than 115 million people.\nBy any measure of objective reality, there is a national emergency at the southern border.\nThere\u2019s also another national emergency. It\u2019s in Washington where Congress refuses to recognize reality or do anything about it.\nThe president took an oath to preserve and protect our country.\nHe takes that oath seriously.\nCongress must take off its blindfold and work with President Trump to end the immigration crisis threatening our nation.\nKimberly Guilfoyle (@KimGuilfoyle) is vice chairwoman of America First Policies, a nonprofit organization supporting key policy initiatives that will work for all citizens in our country and put America first.\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of The Daily Caller.",

Bernie Sanders and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke.\nIt took O\u2019Rourke just one day to raise over $6.1 million after his Thursday presidential bid announcement, and Sanders raised $10 million in just a week after he announced in February. Fundraising being key to what is considered the \u201cmoney primary,\u201d Biden reportedly expressed his desire to \u201cannounce a large fundraising number after his candidacy is official,\u201d according to the WSJ.\nEarlier this month, Biden chief strategist Steve Ricchetti said his boss was around 95 percent committed to tossing his hat into the ring, the New York Times reported, but the former vice president did express concern about the fact that President Donald Trump is unlikely \u201cto stop at anything\u201d to defeat his Democratic opponent. (RELATED: Biden Gets Four Point Bump In Latest Poll)\nMeanwhile, top Democratic fundraiser Philip Levine told the WSJ that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d he would back Biden were he to announce.\n\u201cI think he would be a great nominee. In order to win the general election, we must have an experienced centrist,\u201d said Levine. \u201cProgressives win districts. Centrists win states.\u201d\nFollow Scott on Twitter",

Though Lanza had access to a cache of weapons &mdash; including handguns, shotguns, two rifles, and three swords &mdash; the plaintiffs said Bushmaster&rsquo;s promotions prompted Lanza to choose the XM15 from his family&rsquo;s stockpile, thereby making his shooting spree far more deadly.</p>\n<p>However, Lanza did not himself buy the XM15 &mdash; he stole the gun from his mother, who purchased it lawfully from a retail gun dealership in March 2010. For that reason among others, the Connecticut Supreme Court acknowledged the plaintiffs will have a hard time proving their allegation.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The plaintiffs allege that the defendants&rsquo; wrongful advertising magnified the lethality of the <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dailycaller.com/buzz/sandy-hook&source=gmail&ust=1553131577073000&usg=AFQjCNF5glCGEgDlvp12AFCOhTEoHpJoCw\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/buzz/sandy-hook\">Sandy Hook</a> massacre by inspiring Lanza or causing him to select a more efficiently deadly weapon for his attack,&rdquo; the decision reads. &ldquo;Proving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Gottlieb went further, arguing there is no evidence connecting Lanza with Bushmaster&rsquo;s practices.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no evidence the killer was driven by any advertising whatsoever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is an affront to the First Amendment as well as the Second. Even hinting that the killer was motivated in some way by an advertising message is so far out in the weeds that it may take a map for the court to find its way back.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The case need not reach a verdict to damage the firearms industry. The pre-trial discovery phase will give the plaintiffs access to Bushmaster&rsquo;s internal communications and other sensitive records, which could itself prove harmful to the company.</p>\n<p>An appeal could follow to the <a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://dailycaller.com/buzz/supreme-court&source=gmail&ust=1553131577073000&usg=AFQjCNGR0LDvjBVtz-FMRdi9CEJQ29ZWAA\" href=\"https://dailycaller.com/buzz/supreme-court\">U.S. Supreme Court</a>.</p>\n<p>Lanza killed 27 people Dec. 14, 2012.

                "text": "Second Amendment advocacy groups are denouncing a state court decision allowing families of several Sandy Hook victims to sue a gun manufacturer.\nThe manufacturer, Bushmaster Firearms, produced and marketed the XM15, which shooter Adam Lanza used to kill more than 20 people.\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court said the plaintiffs can try and convince a jury that Bushmaster\u2019s marketing campaign for the weapon broke state law.\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court\u2019s Thursday ruling allowing victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre to sue gun manufacturer Bushmaster Firearms left Second Amendment groups bewildered.\nThe 4-3 decision found that the plaintiffs \u2014 the families of nine victims \u2014 can sue Bushmaster under state unfair trade practices law, despite a federal statute that protects the gun industry from most lawsuits.\n\u201cThis is like suing Ford or General Motors because a car they sold was stolen and used to run over a pedestrian all because the car manufacturers advertised that their car had better acceleration and performance than other vehicles,\u201d said the Second Amendment Foundation\u2019s Alan Gottlieb.\n\u201cThis ruling strains logic, if not common sense,\u201d Gottlieb added. \u201cThe court dismissed the bulk of the lawsuit\u2019s allegations, but appears to have grasped at this single straw by deciding that the advertising is somehow at fault for what Adam Lanza did that day in December more than six years ago.\u201d\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), which filed an amicus (or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d) brief sporting Bushmaster, said the court was exploiting a narrow exception to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) that shields gunmakers from civil liability in most instances.\n\u201cIn a strongly worded and well-reasoned dissent, Chief Justice Robinson rejected the majority\u2019s overly broad interpretation of the scope of the limited exception, which is contrary to legislative text, canons of statutory interpretation and the legislative history of the PLCAA,\u201d NSSF said in a statement. \u201cThe majority\u2019s decision today is at odds with all other state and federal appellate courts that have interpreted the scope of the exception.\u201d\nThat exception cancels the gun manufacturer\u2019s immunity if it knowingly breaks a law \u201capplicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\u201d\nIn other words, the plaintiffs believe that Bushmaster\u2019s advertising scheme violated Connecticut\u2019s unfair trade practices law, because it encouraged the use of its weapons for unlawful purposes. (RELATED: Supreme Court Takes Up First Gun Rights Case In A Decade)\nLanza used an AR-15 style rife called the XM15 during his rampage. The plaintiffs say Bushmaster glorified the weapon\u2019s \u201cmilitaristic and assaultive qualities,\u201d tailoring a campaign with depictions of soldiers on patrol and promises of total dominance in combat. Such images appealed to disillusioned men, supplemented with slogans like \u201cconsider your man card reissued.\u201d\nThose appeals were especially effective with Lanza, they say, since he was an avid player of violent video games and aspired to a career as a special operator in the armed forces. Though Lanza had access to a cache of weapons \u2014 including handguns, shotguns, two rifles, and three swords \u2014 the plaintiffs said Bushmaster\u2019s promotions prompted Lanza to choose the XM15 from his family\u2019s stockpile, thereby making his shooting spree far more deadly.\nHowever, Lanza did not himself buy the XM15 \u2014 he stole the gun from his mother, who purchased it lawfully from a retail gun dealership in March 2010. For that reason among others, the Connecticut Supreme Court acknowledged the plaintiffs will have a hard time proving their allegation.\n\u201cThe plaintiffs allege that the defendants\u2019 wrongful advertising magnified the lethality of the Sandy Hook massacre by inspiring Lanza or causing him to select a more efficiently deadly weapon for his attack,\u201d the decision reads. \u201cProving such a causal link at trial may prove to be a Herculean task.\u201d\nGottlieb went further, arguing there is no evidence connecting Lanza with Bushmaster\u2019s practices.\n\u201cThere is no evidence the killer was driven by any advertising whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an affront to the First Amendment as well as the Second. Even hinting that the killer was motivated in some way by an advertising message is so far out in the weeds that it may take a map for the court to find its way back.\u201d\nThe case need not reach a verdict to damage the firearms industry. The pre-trial discovery phase will give the plaintiffs access to Bushmaster\u2019s internal communications and other sensitive records, which could itself prove harmful to the company.\nAn appeal could follow to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nLanza killed 27 people Dec. 14, 2012. After murdering his mother, he stormed Sandy Hook elementary at 9:30 am where he killed 20 students and six staff. Several others were wounded. The student victims were 6- and 7-year-olds in the first grade.\nSend tips to kevin@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Linda Sarsour Attacks \u2018White Feminist\u2019 Nancy Pelosi)\n\u201cWill you donate $10 this month so that we can continue to stand up boldly against Islamophobia and be ready to show up for our neighbors in times of need?\u201d Sarsour asked in the email.\n\u201cThe same ideology that inspired the Christchurch shooters inspired the Pittsburgh shooter. They were inspired and radicalized by the xenophobic and hateful rhetoric of Trump and his administration,\u201d Sarsour continued. \u201cTrump has declined to address whether he recognizes the rise in white nationalism that is clear for the eye to see.\u201d\n\u201cWe see things differently. I want to forge a new way. We\u2019re building a community out of fierce love for ourselves and each other and rejecting the politics of hate and divisiveness. Our children depend on it. Our country depends on it,\u201d she said.\nSarsour then asked supporters to \u201cgive the gift of justice\u201d by donating to Women\u2019s March.\nWomen\u2019s March did not return an email seeking comment on the fundraising email.\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

                "html": "<p>One of the many hopes of a Medicare-for-all program is that in giving our government a larger share of the medical &ldquo;market&rdquo; (for lack of a better term), Americans&mdash;collectively&mdash;will be able to negotiate down the skyrocketing costs of medicine. Every day brings tragic stories of Americans young and old, of all racial backgrounds, dying after <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/1/14/1826127/-Furloughed-federal-worker-rations-insulin-goes-to-bed-not-knowing-if-she-ll-wake-up-in-the-morning\">rationing their insulin</a>&mdash;the result of explosive increases in the costs of the drug. While some people&rsquo;s diabetes treatments have risen from $24 to $80 per vial over the past decade, others face much more prohibitive prices. As diabetes patient Alec Raeshawn Smith&rsquo;s mother told<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing\"> NPR in September</a>, her son&rsquo;s monthly bill for insulin and related supplies was around $1,300 without insurance&mdash;something he and his family could not afford. He died, having most likely been rationing a lifesaving medication he could not afford.</p>\n<p>These aren&rsquo;t outliers. According to a study by Yale University researchers, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/well/diabetes-patients-at-risk-from-rising-insulin-prices.html\">1 in 4 people with diabetes are rationing their prescriptions.</a> This is not a new phenomenon, but one that is getting worse with the <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2510902\">continuing rise in drug costs.</a></p>\n<p>The most severe cost of insulin deprivation is death, but people who survive with diabetes have to deal with the stresses brought about by rising and falling blood sugar levels. These can include passing out, losing one&rsquo;s ability to control their temper, nausea, and dizziness. A woman recounted to the <em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/living-with-type-1-diabetes-when-you-cant-afford-insulin?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_brand=tny&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter\">New Yorker</a></em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/as-told-to/living-with-type-1-diabetes-when-you-cant-afford-insulin?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_brand=tny&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter\">&rsquo;s</a> Amanda Schaffer how she and her sister, who both have Type 1 diabetes, have shared and rationed their insulin due to its rising costs. It&rsquo;s something that has driven her life, leading to her dropping out of college her first year: &ldquo;I lost a lot of weight that year, about twenty pounds. When you don&rsquo;t have insulin, you can&rsquo;t eat much because you can&rsquo;t correct your blood sugar. So I was barely eating. I was supposed to take four to five shots of insulin a day, and I was only taking two to three. I was lethargic all the time. I was rationing just so I could live. I knew if I ran out I wouldn&rsquo;t survive more than a few days. That took a mental toll.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The solution is cheaper insulin. The problem, as Audrey Farley writes in the <em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/02/19/drug-prices-are-killing-diabetics-walmart-insulin-isnt-solution/?utm_term=.ee4efefe8676\">Washington Post</a></em>, is that many people are hoping that older types of cheaper insulin are the solution&mdash;they just need to go to Walmart! The problem with using older forms of insulin is that the level of planning for adults and children can be unrealistic, as the older, slower-acting forms must be taken well in advance of eating meals. The costs of older, slow-acting insulins may be less, but the possibility of error on the part of patients is much higher. When Trump breaks his campaign promises about lowering drug prices, he&rsquo;s not simply being a corrupt liar&mdash;he&rsquo;s complicit in our growing public health crises.</p>",

                "text": "One of the many hopes of a Medicare-for-all program is that in giving our government a larger share of the medical \u201cmarket\u201d (for lack of a better term), Americans\u2014collectively\u2014will be able to negotiate down the skyrocketing costs of medicine. Every day brings tragic stories of Americans young and old, of all racial backgrounds, dying after rationing their insulin\u2014the result of explosive increases in the costs of the drug. While some people\u2019s diabetes treatments have risen from $24 to $80 per vial over the past decade, others face much more prohibitive prices. As diabetes patient Alec Raeshawn Smith\u2019s mother told NPR in September, her son\u2019s monthly bill for insulin and related supplies was around $1,300 without insurance\u2014something he and his family could not afford. He died, having most likely been rationing a lifesaving medication he could not afford.\nThese aren\u2019t outliers. According to a study by Yale University researchers, 1 in 4 people with diabetes are rationing their prescriptions. This is not a new phenomenon, but one that is getting worse with the continuing rise in drug costs.\nThe most severe cost of insulin deprivation is death, but people who survive with diabetes have to deal with the stresses brought about by rising and falling blood sugar levels. These can include passing out, losing one\u2019s ability to control their temper, nausea, and dizziness. A woman recounted to the New Yorker\u2019s Amanda Schaffer how she and her sister, who both have Type 1 diabetes, have shared and rationed their insulin due to its rising costs. It\u2019s something that has driven her life, leading to her dropping out of college her first year: \u201cI lost a lot of weight that year, about twenty pounds. When you don\u2019t have insulin, you can\u2019t eat much because you can\u2019t correct your blood sugar. So I was barely eating. I was supposed to take four to five shots of insulin a day, and I was only taking two to three. I was lethargic all the time. I was rationing just so I could live. I knew if I ran out I wouldn\u2019t survive more than a few days. That took a mental toll.\u201d\nThe solution is cheaper insulin. The problem, as Audrey Farley writes in the Washington Post, is that many people are hoping that older types of cheaper insulin are the solution\u2014they just need to go to Walmart! The problem with using older forms of insulin is that the level of planning for adults and children can be unrealistic, as the older, slower-acting forms must be taken well in advance of eating meals.

When Trump's former lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to making illegal hush money payments at the direction of Trump to silence two women, the <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sdny-cohen.pdf\">sentencing recommendation</a> sent shockwaves through legal circles <a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/12/8/1817767/-Federal-prosecutors-argue-Individual-1-committed-a-felony\">because it alleged</a> that a sitting president, or &quot;Individual 1,&quot; had committed a felony.</p>\n<p>Trump has reportedly always viewed federal investigators in Manhattan as his biggest threat, since they have jurisdiction over his family business, his now-closed foundation, and even his campaign because it's headquartered at Trump Tower in the city. And whatever hazards Robert Mueller's Russia probe holds for Trump and his inner circle, the ongoing investigations elsewhere are likely to hold far more legal jeopardy of the criminal variety over time, especially if Trump doesn't win re-election.</p>\n<p>Trump is reportedly keenly aware of the legal &ldquo;hellscape&rdquo; he's facing beyond Mueller, according to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-to-legal-team-stay-for-coming-legal-hellscape\">the Daily Beast</a>, and late last year he began encouraging his legal team to stick around even after Mueller concludes his investigation. Here are several <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/trump-associates-mueller-investigation-1186392\">areas of legal jeopardy</a> that will continue hanging over Trump, his family, and his associates, no matter what happens with Mueller:</p>\n<ul> <li>The Trump family business, including its finances, tax practices, potential money laundering, and means of gaining financing through Deutsche Bank</li> <li>The inauguration, a $107 million gusher that's currently being scrutinized by federal prosecutors for pay-to-play schemes and potential illegal foreign donations</li> <li>The hush money payments that violated campaign finance laws&mdash;Cohen has pleaded guilty to those charges, but legal action has yet to be taken regarding Trump's participation</li> <li>Emoluments lawsuits, which have been filed by the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia</li> <li>The Trump Foundation, which has already been shut down, but investigations into its board members, including three of Trump's kids&mdash;Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka&mdash;continue</li> <li>House lawmakers have also turned over more than 50 transcripts of Trump associate testimony for review by Mueller; and Senate Intelligence Chair Richard Burr said his committee has &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/richard-burr-on-senate-intelligence-committees-russia-investigation-2-years-on/\">not been shy</a>&quot; about making criminal referrals to the Department of Justice stemming from its Russia investigation</li> </ul>\n<p>In addition to all that, the Mueller investigation itself could continue to be its own wild card. Even after the special counsel delivers his report, a slate of sealed indictments filed in the D.C. federal courthouse might actually outlive Mueller's appointment. At this very moment, members of Trump's inner circle, including his family members, could be indicted and not even know it.</p>",

Their role in the affair has already earned both the IRA and many of those who lead it <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download\">a hefty set of charges</a> from Robert Mueller and the special counsel&rsquo;s office, including charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States. But on Election Day 2018, the IRA&rsquo;s ongoing role in election interference earned them something else&mdash;a direct attack from the NSA&rsquo;s Cyber Command.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-cyber-command-operation-disrupted-internet-access-of-russian-troll-factory-on-day-of-2018-midterms/2019/02/26/1827fc9e-36d6-11e9-af5b-b51b7ff322e9_story.html?utm_term=.2475db7bfb83\">As the <em>Washington Post</em> reports</a>, U.S. Cyber Command fired more than a warning shot across IRA&rsquo;s bow, demonstrating an ability to completely shut down the state-sponsored hackers by taking away their internet access.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&ldquo;They basically took the IRA offline,&rdquo; according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. &ldquo;They shut &lsquo;em down.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Experts were not sure if the demonstration would have any lasting effect on Russia&rsquo;s tactics, and it&rsquo;s not clear that anything has really changed post-attack. The IRA still seems to be active in, among other things, cyber intrusion and using both human and bot trolls to direct social media conversations. That&rsquo;s been true in both the U.S. where bots have been important in boosting stories that seek to divide Democrats, and in the U.K., where the IRA is amplifying the confusion around Brexit. There are also concerns from some that, having demonstrated to Russia that it can take action, Russia will surely move to safeguard its efforts against this specific form of attack.</p>\n<p>But the bigger question should be: What took so long? Why, if they had the capability to disrupt the IRA (and the IRA was a known instigator in 2016), did the NSA not move to take the IRA and related groups offline when it could have had the most impact in securing democracy?</p>\n<p>U.S. Cyber Command began another effort in the month before the 2018 election. It began sending direct messages and emails to the accounts of Russian operatives informing them that they were known instigators, and that Cyber Command was aware of their activities. The Russians were shown that the NSA had connected their online accounts and their real names. That effort seems to have generated a fair amount of paranoia within the IRA, and created an &ldquo;internal investigation&rdquo; to find potential leakers.</p>\n<p>In any case, the 2018 elections seemed to be much less hampered by efforts to intrude into local and state election information, disrupt elections through planted stories and targeted ads, and false fronts masquerading as U.S. interest groups.

                "text": "The Internet Research Agency (IRA) is one of the Russian agencies involved in the country\u2019s all-too-successful 2016 efforts to support Donald Trump and wreck the U.S. election system. Their role in the affair has already earned both the IRA and many of those who lead it a hefty set of charges from Robert Mueller and the special counsel\u2019s office, including charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States. But on Election Day 2018, the IRA\u2019s ongoing role in election interference earned them something else\u2014a direct attack from the NSA\u2019s Cyber Command.\nAs the Washington Post reports, U.S. Cyber Command fired more than a warning shot across IRA\u2019s bow, demonstrating an ability to completely shut down the state-sponsored hackers by taking away their internet access.\n\u201cThey basically took the IRA offline,\u201d according to one individual familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified information. \u201cThey shut \u2018em down.\u201d\nExperts were not sure if the demonstration would have any lasting effect on Russia\u2019s tactics, and it\u2019s not clear that anything has really changed post-attack. The IRA still seems to be active in, among other things, cyber intrusion and using both human and bot trolls to direct social media conversations. That\u2019s been true in both the U.S. where bots have been important in boosting stories that seek to divide Democrats, and in the U.K., where the IRA is amplifying the confusion around Brexit. There are also concerns from some that, having demonstrated to Russia that it can take action, Russia will surely move to safeguard its efforts against this specific form of attack.\nBut the bigger question should be: What took so long? Why, if they had the capability to disrupt the IRA (and the IRA was a known instigator in 2016), did the NSA not move to take the IRA and related groups offline when it could have had the most impact in securing democracy?\nU.S. Cyber Command began another effort in the month before the 2018 election. It began sending direct messages and emails to the accounts of Russian operatives informing them that they were known instigators, and that Cyber Command was aware of their activities. The Russians were shown that the NSA had connected their online accounts and their real names. That effort seems to have generated a fair amount of paranoia within the IRA, and created an \u201cinternal investigation\u201d to find potential leakers.\nIn any case, the 2018 elections seemed to be much less hampered by efforts to intrude into local and state election information, disrupt elections through planted stories and targeted ads, and false fronts masquerading as U.S. interest groups. So the cyber attacks may have been successful \u2026\nOr they could have been a minor skirmish in a war where the next major battle is less than two years away.",

Just 13 Republicans voted with Democrats, keeping the final tally low enough to demonstrate that an override of a Trump veto would not be possible.</p>\n<p>The bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is required by law. Thus far, there are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1100470131698909188\">three Republicans</a> saying they will vote against Trump: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Thom Tillis. All Democrats will vote for this resolution and against Trump, so that makes 50. One Republican, Roger Wicker, has been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1100461036929536001\">back and forth and noncommittal</a>, but is probably not anxious to be that 51st vote against Trump.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/431658-gop-leader-unsure-on-legality-of-trumps-emergency-declaration\">playing dumb</a>, saying he&rsquo;s just a simple country law school graduate and trying to figure out the separation of powers is beyond his abilities, so he really can&rsquo;t say if Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration is legal. He apparently flunked the Article I part of constitutional law. Or, possibly, he cares more about protecting Trump and the Republican Party than about the institutions of our government.</p>",

Just 13 Republicans voted with Democrats, keeping the final tally low enough to demonstrate that an override of a Trump veto would not be possible.\nThe bill now goes to the Senate, where a vote is required by law. Thus far, there are three Republicans saying they will vote against Trump: Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Thom Tillis. All Democrats will vote for this resolution and against Trump, so that makes 50. One Republican, Roger Wicker, has been back and forth and noncommittal, but is probably not anxious to be that 51st vote against Trump.\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is playing dumb, saying he\u2019s just a simple country law school graduate and trying to figure out the separation of powers is beyond his abilities, so he really can\u2019t say if Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is legal. He apparently flunked the Article I part of constitutional law. Or, possibly, he cares more about protecting Trump and the Republican Party than about the institutions of our government.",

The Senate, too, can find not much to say about the attack.</p>\n<p>That leaves the House, which conveniently is now under the control of a party that does not have to hedge its statements on violent white nationalism for fear of upsetting a conservative white nationalist base. Erin Banco and Sam Stein report that House Judiciary Committee Democrats will be reigniting a much-needed discussion of far-right extremism by holding the first hearing in years on the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-judiciary-committee-planning-hearing-on-the-rise-of-white-nationalism\">violent white nationalist movement</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>Though plans are still being finalized, the committee expects to bring in officials from within the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for questioning on the rise of white nationalism in the U.S and the efforts the agencies are currently adopting to combat it. One lawmaker said the goal is to &ldquo;have a hearing in early April.&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p>For about a decade now Republicans (and Fox News) have met government attempts to combat far-right terrorism with furious outrage, claiming as usual that their views as conservatives are under federal attack by such efforts. In the earliest days of the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning of the elevated threat of right-wing terrorism&mdash;and was met with such universal Republican condemnation that it was forced to then apologize for issuing that warning, despite its obvious truth and despite far-right violence now far outpacing violent acts by other terrorist groups. Republicans have blocked and belittled further efforts to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute far-right extremists ever since, all under the same apparent belief that investigating violent far-right groups would infringe too conspicuously on their own base.</p>\n<p>That will likely continue, but House Democrats are not as likely to go along with the Republican efforts as they were 10 years and many terrorist attacks ago.</p>\n<p>Far-right violence has continued to escalate in the Trump era, with militant groups such as the &quot;Proud Boys&quot; becomingly increasingly entwined with more mainstream conservatism, and with European far-right white nationalist groups becoming increasingly intwined with Republican House members' Twitter feeds. At the very least, Trump administration heads are going to be brought before Congress and grilled as to what they are doing to combat now-regular white nationalist attacks in the United States and elsewhere. &quot;Nothing&quot; will no longer be taken as acceptable answer.</p>",

                "text": "After a white nationalism-espousing terrorist killed 50 people in two Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques, the current American administration has largely clammed up, offering only rote sympathy to the victims and proposing, of course, absolutely nothing that might prevent future far-right terrorist acts. The Senate, too, can find not much to say about the attack.\nThat leaves the House, which conveniently is now under the control of a party that does not have to hedge its statements on violent white nationalism for fear of upsetting a conservative white nationalist base. Erin Banco and Sam Stein report that House Judiciary Committee Democrats will be reigniting a much-needed discussion of far-right extremism by holding the first hearing in years on the violent white nationalist movement.\nThough plans are still being finalized, the committee expects to bring in officials from within the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI for questioning on the rise of white nationalism in the U.S and the efforts the agencies are currently adopting to combat it. One lawmaker said the goal is to \u201chave a hearing in early April.\u201d\nFor about a decade now Republicans (and Fox News) have met government attempts to combat far-right terrorism with furious outrage, claiming as usual that their views as conservatives are under federal attack by such efforts. In the earliest days of the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning of the elevated threat of right-wing terrorism\u2014and was met with such universal Republican condemnation that it was forced to then apologize for issuing that warning, despite its obvious truth and despite far-right violence now far outpacing violent acts by other terrorist groups. Republicans have blocked and belittled further efforts to investigate, disrupt, and prosecute far-right extremists ever since, all under the same apparent belief that investigating violent far-right groups would infringe too conspicuously on their own base.\nThat will likely continue, but House Democrats are not as likely to go along with the Republican efforts as they were 10 years and many terrorist attacks ago.\nFar-right violence has continued to escalate in the Trump era, with militant groups such as the \"Proud Boys\" becomingly increasingly entwined with more mainstream conservatism, and with European far-right white nationalist groups becoming increasingly intwined with Republican House members' Twitter feeds. At the very least, Trump administration heads are going to be brought before Congress and grilled as to what they are doing to combat now-regular white nationalist attacks in the United States and elsewhere. \"Nothing\" will no longer be taken as acceptable answer.",

(Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Curtis Flowers faces a death sentence in Mississippi after six different trials, and now the Supreme Court will hear a challenge on the verdict in the sixth trial&mdash;a challenge that could set new precedent on <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/supreme-court-racial-bias-jury-selection\">racial discrimination in jury selection</a>. Flowers is currently convicted of a 1996 murder, but three different convictions have already been struck down by state courts, while two trials resulted in hung juries. The conviction in the sixth trial came after District Attorney Doug Evans struck five black people from the jury &hellip; after Flowers&rsquo; <em>third</em> conviction was overturned because Evans had excluded 15 black people from the jury.</p>\n<p>In fact, &ldquo;Evans has removed black jurors at 4.5 times the rate that he struck white jurors, according to an &lsquo;In the Dark&rsquo; analysis of 6,700 jurors in 225 trials over 26 years.&rdquo; In other words, he is a racist prosecutor who&rsquo;s been getting away with using unconstitutional means to keep black people off of juries.</p>\n<p>But will the Trump Supreme Court use this case to crack down on racially biased prosecutions, or will it use this case to give prosecutors free rein to assemble white juries to convict black people despite weak evidence? A separate challenge to Flowers&rsquo; conviction, by the way, focuses on the weak evidence used against him, including a jailhouse informant&rsquo;s recantation of a claim that Flowers confessed to him. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing a prosecutor can use a carefully chosen jury to get around, if the court allows those careful (racist) choices.</p>",

Flowers is currently convicted of a 1996 murder, but three different convictions have already been struck down by state courts, while two trials resulted in hung juries. The conviction in the sixth trial came after District Attorney Doug Evans struck five black people from the jury \u2026 after Flowers\u2019 third conviction was overturned because Evans had excluded 15 black people from the jury.\nIn fact, \u201cEvans has removed black jurors at 4.5 times the rate that he struck white jurors, according to an \u2018In the Dark\u2019 analysis of 6,700 jurors in 225 trials over 26 years.\u201d In other words, he is a racist prosecutor who\u2019s been getting away with using unconstitutional means to keep black people off of juries.\nBut will the Trump Supreme Court use this case to crack down on racially biased prosecutions, or will it use this case to give prosecutors free rein to assemble white juries to convict black people despite weak evidence? A separate challenge to Flowers\u2019 conviction, by the way, focuses on the weak evidence used against him, including a jailhouse informant\u2019s recantation of a claim that Flowers confessed to him. That\u2019s the sort of thing a prosecutor can use a carefully chosen jury to get around, if the court allows those careful (racist) choices.",

Will he retreat or stay firm and poised. Well as it has been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/16/politics/pete-buttigieg-iowa-anti-gay-chants/index.html\">Reported</a> yesterday in Iowa he has the chance to make me, as a out Latino Catholic gay man, pretty fucking great and proud</p>\n<p>In an event where hecklers invoked Aodoma and Gomorrah this happened</p>\n<blockquote> Buttigieg is gay and has talked openly about his Episcopalian faith. The Democratic presidential candidate sought to dispatch the disruptions without attacking the demonstrators, but did acknowledge the disturbances and, at one point, the fact that the men had the right to voice their opinion. &quot;The good news is, the condition of my soul is in the hands of God but the Iowa Caucuses are up to you,&quot; Buttigieg said </blockquote>\n<p>&iexcl;Am&eacute;n!</p>\n<p>He Aknowledged that IA was one of th3 first to make marriage equality legal 10 yees ago.</p>\n<p>I know many don&rsquo;t like his PERSONAL relationship with his faith and being vocal about in, I find it refreshing as I never thought I would. Being raised Catholic , have lived in a ver socially conservative south American country (Chile) during my late teens and 20s, sometimes you don&rsquo;t realize the 5hings that make you you until you see them reflected in public figures.</p>\n<p>&lsquo;The other hecklers</p>\n<blockquote> The first disruption came in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where a man at the roughly 100-person event stood up and yelled, &quot;We will not stop, he is misleading our children.&quot; </blockquote>\n<blockquote> The man was shouted down by the audience and once he was removed from the event, Buttigieg said, &quot;We are so dug in in such passionate ways.&quot; </blockquote>\n<blockquote> &quot;That gentleman believes that what he is doing is in line with the will of the creator,&quot; he said. &quot;I view it differently. We ought to be able to view it differently.&quot; </blockquote>\n<p>How many of my queer friends can relate to this feeling before embracing the beautiful person God made me and put me in Earth for</p>\n<blockquote> Buttigieg came out in 2015, months before he was re-elected as South Bend's mayor. He has talked about the fact that he was uncomfortable with being gay early in his life and told an audience at an LGBTQ event earlier this month that &quot;if you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife.&quot;  </blockquote>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YpK24jfPXlY\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Gracias Se&ntilde;or Alcalde, my heart is little bit bigger today.</p>",

Will he retreat or stay firm and poised. Well as it has been Reported yesterday in Iowa he has the chance to make me, as a out Latino Catholic gay man, pretty fucking great and proud\nIn an event where hecklers invoked Aodoma and Gomorrah this happened\nButtigieg is gay and has talked openly about his Episcopalian faith. The Democratic presidential candidate sought to dispatch the disruptions without attacking the demonstrators, but did acknowledge the disturbances and, at one point, the fact that the men had the right to voice their opinion.\n\"The good news is, the condition of my soul is in the hands of God but the Iowa Caucuses are up to you,\" Buttigieg said\n\u00a1Am\u00e9n!\nHe Aknowledged that IA was one of th3 first to make marriage equality legal 10 yees ago.\nI know many don\u2019t like his PERSONAL relationship with his faith and being vocal about in, I find it refreshing as I never thought I would. Being raised Catholic , have lived in a ver socially conservative south American country (Chile) during my late teens and 20s, sometimes you don\u2019t realize the 5hings that make you you until you see them reflected in public figures.\n\u2018The other hecklers\nThe first disruption came in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where a man at the roughly 100-person event stood up and yelled, \"We will not stop, he is misleading our children.\"\nThe man was shouted down by the audience and once he was removed from the event, Buttigieg said, \"We are so dug in in such passionate ways.\"\n\"That gentleman believes that what he is doing is in line with the will of the creator,\" he said. \"I view it differently. We ought to be able to view it differently.\"\nHow many of my queer friends can relate to this feeling before embracing the beautiful person God made me and put me in Earth for\nButtigieg came out in 2015, months before he was re-elected as South Bend's mayor. He has talked about the fact that he was uncomfortable with being gay early in his life and told an audience at an LGBTQ event earlier this month that \"if you had shown me exactly what it was that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife.\"\nGracias Se\u00f1or Alcalde, my heart is little bit bigger today.",

The news will travel.\nThere is a crisis in the Republican party, and how big a crisis that is and how much of a role that plays in the election is partly up to us. I suggest one should read the reactions in the room as a sign that old categories can be breached in some numbers. The whole \u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u201d thing has some universal power.\nThe Democratic Party does itself a disservice when it refuses to engage. Just a 1% flip-rate would change the margin by 2%. We cannot under any circumstances afford to leave that many votes on the table.",

Well my experience with those I believed were \u201creasonable\u201d over decades turned out so wrong I was astounded!\nI was fooled myself into thinking there was NO way my \u201creasonable\u201d Republican friends could ever fall for this buffoon!\nMan was I wrong! I spent years trying to \u201creason\u201d with them. Not to change their minds about their own Republican \u201cvalues\u201d they\u2019d always touted; like morality (as they saw it) and honesty and transparency and taking responsibility and accountability and patriotism.\nBut to try to get them to repeat them in the face of supporting Trump!\nAll those values when I questioned them about what they\u2019d always said they believed in went right out the window! And they had NO answers except to repeat drone like that it was Hillary who was unpatriotic and it was Hillary who was a felon and Hillary who lies and colluded and money laundered and was mobbed up!\nPure projections you can only get from a full blown un-self-aware LOON! And this from people whom I thought at least intelligent if mistaken.\nSorry. There is only one way in our Republic to deal with people like Trump and institutions like FOX and their cultists. Take NO bait from them. And VOTE THEM OUT OF POWER!\nThey wanna talk?\nFine! We can \u201ctalk\u201d after they are OUT of power!\nPreferably through a small window into their padded room!\n: )\nJust my conclusion.",

According to Moulitsas, Sanders&rsquo;s appearance on Fox&mdash;and Buttigieg being in talks to appear on Fox&mdash;are concerning especially because &ldquo;[Trump] clearly believes the network is his, and it&rsquo;s operated as such &hellip; it has basically become his propaganda arm.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As recently as yesterday, Trump even referred to the network in first person (&ldquo;we&rdquo; having Donna Brazile refers to the former DNC chair <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/18/donna-brazile-hired-fox-news-political-contributor/3203813002/\">joining the network recently as a paid contributor</a>).</p>\n<blockquote><p>So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FoxNews</a>. Not surprisingly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretBaier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BretBaier</a> and the &Atilde;&cent;&Acirc;&Acirc;audience&Atilde;&cent;&Acirc;&Acirc; was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/donnabrazile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@donnabrazile</a>?</p>&Atilde;&cent;&Acirc;&Acirc; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1118155023849017345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 16, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>You can view a short clip, as well as the full segment, after the jump.</p>\n<blockquote><p>ICYMI: Should more Democrats follow Bernie Sanders and reach out to the Fox News audience? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTPDaily?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MTPDaily</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Markos</a>: &quot;It's actually a smart move for him personally, but it just goes to show once again that he's not a team player.&quot; <a href=\"https://t.co/KrGeAWr7uS\">pic.twitter.com/KrGeAWr7uS</a></p>&Atilde;&cent;&Acirc;&Acirc; Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeetThePress/status/1118343108398333952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 17, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<p>Moulitsas also had a lot to say about the rise of Mayor Pete and his viability as a candidate:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&ldquo;This is a world where a viral moment can decide who the next rising star is. Mayor Pete has an incredible resume. He is clearly very smart, he&rsquo;s got great framing, he communicates well. So he&rsquo;s doing a lot of the things that I think you need. I&rsquo;m a critic because of his lack of expertise. I mean, he&rsquo;s a small-town, liberal college mayor. I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the step towards the presidency. Just because Donald Trump broke politics doesn&rsquo;t mean that Democrats need to follow suit. But, that said, he injects something fresh and new and exciting into the race, and that has its own value. And whether it has lasting power or not, I think he&rsquo;s motivating people, and to me that&rsquo;s the most important factor moving ahead: do you motivate people? Whether I agree or not is irrelevant&mdash;are liberals fired up and organizing? And I think that Pete Buttigieg is doing a great job at that.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Watch the full segment here:</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/embedded-video/mmvo1495661635749\"></iframe></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"is this the beginning of the end? i surely hope so\" src=\"https://images.dailykos.com/images/588702/large/the-dog-revolution-has-begun-HEAVYGRINDER-FB.png?1536949139\"></img><figcaption>is this the beginning of the end? i surely hope so</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img alt=\"Sit, Rex, Sit.

                "text": "On Tuesday, Markos Moulitsas joined Chuck Todd on Meet the Press Daily to share his thoughts on Bernie Sanders\u2019s town hall on Fox News, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s rapid rise, and what it all means for the Democratic presidential primary. According to Moulitsas, Sanders\u2019s appearance on Fox\u2014and Buttigieg being in talks to appear on Fox\u2014are concerning especially because \u201c[Trump] clearly believes the network is his, and it\u2019s operated as such \u2026 it has basically become his propaganda arm.\u201d\nAs recently as yesterday, Trump even referred to the network in first person (\u201cwe\u201d having Donna Brazile refers to the former DNC chair joining the network recently as a paid contributor).\nSo weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2audience\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile?\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2019\nYou can view a short clip, as well as the full segment, after the jump.\nICYMI: Should more Democrats follow Bernie Sanders and reach out to the Fox News audience? #MTPDaily@Markos: \"It's actually a smart move for him personally, but it just goes to show once again that he's not a team player.\" pic.twitter.com/KrGeAWr7uS\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00c2 Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) April 17, 2019\nMoulitsas also had a lot to say about the rise of Mayor Pete and his viability as a candidate:\n\u201cThis is a world where a viral moment can decide who the next rising star is. Mayor Pete has an incredible resume. He is clearly very smart, he\u2019s got great framing, he communicates well. So he\u2019s doing a lot of the things that I think you need. I\u2019m a critic because of his lack of expertise. I mean, he\u2019s a small-town, liberal college mayor. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the step towards the presidency. Just because Donald Trump broke politics doesn\u2019t mean that Democrats need to follow suit. But, that said, he injects something fresh and new and exciting into the race, and that has its own value. And whether it has lasting power or not, I think he\u2019s motivating people, and to me that\u2019s the most important factor moving ahead: do you motivate people? Whether I agree or not is irrelevant\u2014are liberals fired up and organizing? And I think that Pete Buttigieg is doing a great job at that.\u201d\nWatch the full segment here:",

                "text": "Traces of a controversial weed killer have been detected in a number of the world's leading beer and wine brands, a new report claims.\nIn a study by public-interest advocacy group US PIRG that tested five wines and 15 beers, including organic ones, the chemical glyphosate was found in all but one of the beverages sampled.\nGlyphosate - the most common herbicide in the world and an ingredient in the weed killer Roundup - is a probable human carcinogen, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization.\nThe report acknowledged that the levels detected were below limits set by the Environmental Protection Agency, but PIRG the results warrant some degree of public concern.\n'The levels of glyphosate we found are not necessarily dangerous, but are still concerning given the potential health risks,' PIRG told USA TODAY following the release of the study, which looked at popular brands including Coors Light, Miller Lite, Budweiser, Corona, Heineken and Samuel Adams.\nThe highest concentration of glyphosate was found in the 2018 Sutter Home merlot, which came in at 51.4 parts per billion, or ppb.\nFor beer, Tsingtao from Hong Kong had the most with 49.7ppb, and Coors Light had the most for American beers with 31.1ppb.\nThe study author, US PIRG Edication Fund's Kara Cook-Schultz, said of the study: 'No matter the efforts of brewers and vintners, we found that it is incredibly difficult to avoid the troubling reality that consumers will likely drink glyphosate at every happy hour and backyard barbecue around the country.'\nA spokesperson for the Beer Institute, a national trade organization, responded to the report by telling USA: 'Our members work with farmers who go to great lengths to raise their crops sustainably and safely....and the results of the most recent federal testing showed farmers\u2019 use of glyphosate falls well below federal limits.'\nHERBICIDE LEVELS FOUND IN 20 POPULAR BEER AND WINE BRANDS\nThe ranking below is based on the results of a US PIRG study published in February 2019. The products are ranked by concentration of glyphosate, measured in parts per billion (ppb).\nWINE\nSutter Home Merlot - 51.4ppb\nBeringer Founders Estates Moscato - 42.6ppb\nBarefoot Cabernet Sauvingnon - 36.3ppb\nInkarri Malbec: Certified Organic - 5.3ppb\nFrey Organic Natural White - 4.8ppb\nBEER\nTsingtao Beer - 49.7ppb\nCoors Light - 31.1ppb\nMiller Lite - 29.8ppb\nBudweiser - 27.0ppb\nCorona Extra - 25.1ppb\nHeineken - 20.9ppb\nGuinness Draught - 20.3ppb\nStella Artois - 18.7ppb\nAce Perry Hard Cider - 14.5ppb\nSierra Nevada Pale Ale - 11.8ppb\nNew Belgium Fat Tire Amber Ale - 11.2ppb\nSam Adams New England IPA - 11.0ppb\nStella Artois Cidre - 9.1ppb\nSamuel Smith's Organic Lager - 5.7ppb\nPeak Beer Organic IPA - none detected\nSee full report here\nAnother spokesperson for the Wine Institute said: 'An adult would have to drink more than 140 glasses of wine a day containing the highest glyphosate level measured just to reach the level that California\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has identified as \"No Significant Risk Level.\"'\nWhen contacted about the study by USA, many of the companies whose products were tested questioned the results while others claimed that trace amounts of herbicides are beyond their control.\nOne in particular, organic winery Frey Vineyards, said that while it doesn't use herbicides, trace amounts of glyphosate can be detected in its products because the chemical is now found in rainwater.\nWilliam Reeves, a toxicologist for Bayer, which now owns Roundup manufacturer Monsanto, accused PIRG of blowing the results out of proportion.\n'Assuming the greatest value reported, 51.4ppb, is correct, a 125-pound adult would have to consume 308 gallons of wine per day, every day for life to reach the US Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s glyphosate exposure limit for human,' Reeves told USA.\n'To put 308 gallons into context, that would be more than a bottle of wine every minute, for life, without sleeping.'\nBayer is currently facing some 9,300 lawsuits alleging that its popular glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup causes cancer.\nThe first federal trial against the company began Monday in California, six months after Bayer's share price was rocked by a $289million verdict in California state court.\n'With a federal court looking at the connection between Roundup and cancer today, we believe this is the perfect time to shine a spotlight on glyphosate,' Cook-Schultz said.\n'This chemical could prove a true risk to so many Americans' health, and they should know that it is everywhere \u2013 including in many of their favorite drinks.'\nBayer has denied all allegations that Roundup or glyphosate cause cancer, citing decades of independent studies that have shown the world's most widely used weed killer to be safe for human use and noting that regulators around the world have approved the product.",

Another hotspot today was Porthmadog in North Wales which reached 20.8C (69.4F).</p>\n<p>The warmth follows last February's Beast from the East, which plunged temperatures below freezing and brought heavy snowfall across the country.</p>\n<p>The unseasonably warm weather is expected to continue for another day for most of Britain before parts of the country face possible thunderstorms later in the week, forecasters said.</p>\n<p>Today will be sunny with possible highs of 20C (68F) but is unlikely to continue a trend of record-breaking February temperatures set earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said some parts of southern and western England could be facing thunder on Thursday.</p>\n<p>'Tomorrow will be pretty sunny again for most places,' he said on Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>'There might be a little bit of mist and fog around to start with but that should largely clear.</p>\n<p>'It won't be quite as exceptionally warm so I don't think we will break the record we have reached today.'</p>\n<p>Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'</p>\n<p>He said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.</p>\n<p>'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow will be slightly cooler but still above average for the time of year.</p>\n<p>Heavy showers are possible on Thursday as temperatures struggle to get above 12C (54F). Friday, March 1, will mark the first day of meteorological spring and is expected to be mostly dry before a wet weekend.</p>\n<p>Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall said: 'The weekend doesn't look great, it's looking wet and windy across the country. There's lots of uncertainty over the details because it's still a long way off but wet and windy seems to be the theme.'</p>\n<p>Temperatures recorded in Britain this week are hotter than the Algarve, where it was 18C (64.4F) yesterday.

yesterday</p>\n<h3>Are the warmer winters a sign of climate change?</h3>\n<p>While scientists are reluctant to attribute individual weather fronts such as heatwaves and droughts directly to climate change, there is little doubt that such events are getting more frequent as our planet heats.</p>\n<p>Friederike Otto, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said: 'This is one of the clearest signs of climate change that we have seen, that winter temperatures are increasing and the likelihood of very warm days in winter has increased quite a lot.</p>\n<p>'The fact that spring starts much earlier is one of the very obvious signs of climate change that we see.'</p>\n<p>The last four years have been the hottest on record, with 2018 ending as the fourth-hottest year ever, according to the United Nations.</p>\n<p>Last year alone saw devastating forest fires in Greece and California, a succession of superstorms in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and record-breaking drought in Australia.</p>\n<p>Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'</p>\n<p>He said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.</p>\n<p>'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.</p>\n<p>Holidaymakers hoping to catch rays in Crete will be bitterly disappointed, with the island seeing 1.2in (300mm) of rain yesterday and a maximum temperature of 13C (56F) forecast for today.</p>\n<p>Monday's record highs were likened to a 'climate breakdown' by Green MP Caroline Lucas. Mr Miall said: 'This kind of event is what climate change would expect but we can't directly relate it to climate change.'</p>\n<p>Conditions in Wales were being supercharged by a phenomenon known as the 'Foehn Effect', where moist air dries out as it hits hills or mountains, allowing temperatures to rise further as the air comes down the other side.</p>\n<p>Mr Miall added: 'The reason we've got this exceptionally warm weather is all down to a block weather pattern. This is dragging up warm air from the Canary Islands and southern Spain.'</p>\n<p>While most of the country is basking in sunshine, spare a thought for Quidnish on the Isle of Harris. It was the wettest place in Britain with 10.4mm (0.4in) of rain yesterday, the Met Office said.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"People enjoy the sunshine today at Greys Court in Rotherfield Greys,

warning comes after the UK saw the warmest winter day since records began, with temperatures topping 20C (68F) in several places on Monday, and forecasts suggesting the mercury could rise to near-records again on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The RSPB's wildlife team has been getting calls from people reporting early nesting attempts and even ducklings being spotted across the country.</p>\n<p>There are also reports of hibernating hedgehogs and some reptiles waking up earlier than usual and butterflies emerging prompted by the warm weather.</p>\n<p>Birds are travelling ahead of the 'Saharan plume' of warm air which is bringing the mild temperatures to the UK, with reports of swallows and house martins in Cornwall, Devon and South Wales weeks early, the RSPB said.</p>\n<p>Martin Harper, the charity's director of global conservation, said: 'While the warm weather, bright sunshine and abundant sights and sounds of nature undoubtedly make us all feel better, they should also ring alarm bells.</p>\n<p>'The early signs of spring are likely down to climate change, which is bad news for us all.</p>\n<p>'As we expect the weather to return to temperatures more traditionally associated with this time of year - as they are forecast to - then there could be a real crisis for our birds, insects and other wildlife.'</p>\n<p>The Woodland Trust's Nature's Calendar scheme, which asks the public to track signs of the seasons, has been receiving unusually early records of spring this winter - with some as early as November.</p>\n<p>Mild weather has led to records in January of red admiral, small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies and queen wasps, which are usually seen in mid to late February or early March.</p>\n<p>Trees including field maples and European larches have been bursting into bud early and blue tits have been spotted making nesting attempts as early as Boxing Day.</p>\n<p>The latest bout of unseasonably warm weather has seen more than 250 records of brimstone butterflies emerging for the first time since February 12, with 163 of the sightings taking place since Friday.</p>\n<p>The butterfly normally comes out around March or April, the Trust said.</p>\n<p>Abi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust, said: 'Nature's Calendar data has increasingly brought into question the way we think about the seasons and to see spring in December no longer seems unusual.</p>\n<p>'With butterflies, bumblebees and snowdrops being recorded across the festive period, we may have to start featuring different species on our Christmas cards.</p>\n<p>'But the Nature's Calendar project is more than just spotting the seasons; data sent in by members of the public enables greater understanding of the repercussions climate change has for our beloved flora and fauna, and of the need to act to tackle global warming and other threats to our wildlife.'</p>\n<h2>Why spring in February is a disaster for nature: Yes, it's a joy to see butterflies and blooms burst forth this early in the year... but there may yet be a chilling price to pay, writes JOHN NAISH</h2>\n<p>By JOHN NAISH FOR THE DAILY MAIL</p>\n<p>On Sunday afternoon I was sitting in the garden in a T-shirt, taking a break from some urgent pruning. On a fallen tree trunk nearby a Red Admiral was basking, its pulsing wings blissfully warmed by the sun beaming down from a clear blue sky.</p>\n<p>Just as it did again today &mdash; and, if the forecasters are right, for the rest of the week.</p>\n<p>It is utterly gorgeous &mdash; but worrying. It's only February, for goodness sake! We should all still be shivering in the depths of winter.</p>\n<p>Instead, this past glorious weekend the roads around my home town of Brighton were rammed with sunseekers heading for the beach.</p>\n<p>We tried to escape the melee by heading to a quiet country pub. Quiet? We had to queue for a table in the flower-dappled garden. It felt like a May bank holiday.</p>\n<p>Nature clearly thinks that spring has sprung and then some. Parks and gardens are clad in golden daffodils. Snowdrops are in full bloom on our lawn. Witch hazel and honeysuckles are already emerging.</p>\n<p>And I'm in a panic about pruning back our rampant fig trees. They should still be sound asleep, but instead they are budding wildly.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Fifteen-month-old Darcy and her mother Kerry enjoy the sunshine and warm weather at Parade Gardens in Bath yesterday\" data-src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/26/19/10266524-6746085-Fifteen_month_old_Darcy_and_her_mother_Kerry_enjoy_the_sunshine_-a-23_1551209482721.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>Fifteen-month-old Darcy and her mother Kerry enjoy the sunshine and warm weather at Parade Gardens in Bath yesterday</p>\n<p>Around Britain the story is the same: some species of camellia are making a premature appearance, patches of wild primroses (usually March to May) and even early cherry blossom (March), while scabious, poppies and Virginia stock have stayed in flower since the summer, having apparently forgotten to die back, thanks to a balmy autumn.</p>\n<p>The animal kingdom is stirring prematurely, too. Naturalists report that the dawn chorus &mdash; not usually heard until March &mdash; began at the start of this month.</p>\n<p>Song thrushes are even belting out their mating calls, while bees have been tricked out of hibernation many weeks early. And as for that butterfly in my garden, well I've never spotted one so early in the year before.</p>\n<p>For this latest burst of unseasonal balm &mdash; following a remarkably mild winter &mdash; we can thank a plume of warm southerly air sweeping up from the Canary Islands, sending temperatures into the high teens.</p>\n<p>That is more than twice the normal February average.</p>\n<p>In London's Kew Gardens the highs have nudged 18c. 'This year is particularly mild,' says Guy Barter, the chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.</p>\n<p>'There are a lot of things in flower that you would not expect at this time of the year. Things are running ahead of normal.'</p>\n<p>Indeed. The Met Office confirmed that today was the hottest February on record as temperatures reached 20.3c in parts of Wales.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A group of women enjoy lunch in the sun at Blyth in Northumberland yesterday as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm day\" data-src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/26/19/10261238-6746085-A_group_of_women_enjoy_lunch_in_the_sun_at_Blyth_in_Northumberla-a-25_1551209482725.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>A group of women enjoy lunch in the sun at Blyth in Northumberland yesterday as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm day</p>\n<p>But it's not just the sunny West and South (19c) that's ablaze. The warmest yet February day in Scotland was recorded last week when Aboyne in Aberdeenshire hit 18.3c on Thursday afternoon.</p>\n<p>This beats the previous high of 17.9c recorded in Aberdeen in February 1897. (One wonders if they were fretting about climate change back then.)</p>\n<p>All in all it made for a spectacular weekend for most of us &mdash; with the best part of another week of this weather to come &mdash; and will be welcome when we get our heating bills.</p>\n<p>However, the unexpected warmth is sowing much confusion in the natural world and threatens summer harvests, especially for fruit growers.</p>\n<p>Many of Britain's plants have evolved to use winter's cold to their advantage. In the same way that our bodies need eight hours of sleep in each 24-hour cycle, plants need a period of dormancy during the colder months if they are to thrive in spring.</p>\n<p>This process, called vernalisation, requires a sustained period of cold &mdash; which the plants take as an instruction to re-set their biological clocks in preparation for a new healthy annual cycle.</p>\n<p>For fruit trees, this is not just desirable but vital. Plants such as figs need about 300 chill hours when the temperature is between 0-7c to thrive. Softer fruit such as blackcurrants can require up to 2,000 chill hours to flower at the right time.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A bee takes pollen from a spring bloom in St James's Park in London yesterday\" data-src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/26/17/10281400-6746085-A_bee_takes_pollen_from_a_spring_bloom_in_St_James_s_Park_in_Lon-a-14_1551201149554.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>A bee takes pollen from a spring bloom in St James's Park in London yesterday</p>\n<p>If the mild weather persists, fruit trees may flower too early &mdash; in March or April. 'They would then be vulnerable to a sharp frost that would destroy their blossom,' warns Barter. 'If that happens, they would bear no fruit.'</p>\n<p>And if apple, pear or blackcurrant plants flower early, they may do so at a time when there are fewer bees about, with a good chance they would not then be pollinated and so would not fruit.</p>\n<p>It's a huge worry for orchard owners &mdash; as well as Britain's 40 or so commercial blackcurrant growers, who produce about 14,000 tons of fruit each year.</p>\n<p>Butterflies may also suffer. The winter of 2015 was a warm one &mdash; and what followed was a terrible year for these insects.</p>\n<p>Cold weather kills viruses and bacteria in the soil that many insects, including native species of butterflies and moths, are high vulnerable to. If temperatures stay relatively high, the microbes can decimate insect populations.</p>\n<p>Data gathered by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, from more than 1,800 sites across the country over 37 years, shows higher temperatures affected more than half the species, such as the common blue, comma, peacock and small tortoiseshells.</p>\n<p>There is then a knock-on effect on our native birds which, if they mate and lay eggs early, won't be able to find enough insects to feed their chicks.</p>\n<p>Analysis by conservationists of 30,000 nests over the past decade shows birds such as the chaffinch and the robin lay eggs about a week earlier than in the Sixties. A similar pattern has been seen for blue tits, great tits and swallows.</p>\n<p>And if a proper cold snap should interrupt our mild winter in a month or so, vulnerable chicks could struggle to survive.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A bee collects pollen at National Trust's Wallington Hall, near Morpeth in Northumberland last Friday\" data-src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/26/19/10280728-6746085-A_bee_collects_pollen_at_National_Trust_s_Wallington_Hall_near_M-a-26_1551209482727.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>A bee collects pollen at National Trust's Wallington Hall, near Morpeth in Northumberland last Friday</p>\n<p>Indeed, forecasters are warning that this warm snap may come to a bitter end.</p>\n<p>Meteorologists predict that early March will bring fierce weather sweeping in from the Atlantic, with gales and snow blasting parts of Britain. Spring still holds an icy shard in its heart.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the mild winter to date may be creating the same meteorological conditions that prompted the bitter blast of prolonged cold from Siberia &mdash; dubbed the Beast from the East &mdash; to come roaring in this time last year.</p>\n<p>This involves a phenomenon called 'sudden stratospheric warming' where layers of air high in the stratosphere above us become unseasonably warm and the resultant change in pressure sucks in freezing air from Siberia.</p>\n<h3>How do wildfires start? </h3>\n<p>Grass fires can develop quickly in dry conditions and raised winds with the possibility of quickly spreading.</p>\n<p>They are often caused deliberately by people, but can also happen when controlled fires get out of hand.</p>\n<p>North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said deliberate mountain fires have a 'hugely detrimental' impact on wildlife and the environment.</p>\n<p>When road access is not possible to fight them, then they are often left to burn themselves out.</p>\n<p>Every plant, insect and bird that thought spring had come early would suffer if this is the case.</p>\n<p>Gardeners and lovers of wildlife are keeping their fingers crossed that any cold snap in the next few weeks will be short &mdash; and may actually re-set Nature's clock.</p>\n<p>'It would return fruit-tree flowering to its normal season and be welcomed by most farmers and fruit growers,' Mr Barter says.</p>\n<p>The price we may pay, though, is a depressingly bloom-free gap in spring. That's a worry for the 450 residents of Thriplow in Cambridgeshire, who hope to celebrate their 50th Daffodil Fair.</p>\n<p>Over the past five decades, they have planted more than half a million bulbs around the village and their annual fund-raising weekend near the end of March is a national event, with up to 14,000 people flocking to see the spectacle.</p>\n<p>Last year, though, the entire weekend was laid waste by the Beast from the East.</p>\n<p>This year, the number of daffodils could also be depleted.</p>\n<p>'Some daffs are already out in the village,' says Paul Earnshaw, who is chair of the Fair's charity committee.</p>\n<p>'Daffs do what daffs do. People say that you can hurry them up by putting a hairdryer on them &mdash; or more sensibly, by growing them under polytunnels.</p>\n<p>'But if they are coming up early, then you can't stop them &mdash; you can only be glad to see them.'</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the village has developed another strategy to ensure a good display.</p>\n<p>'We spread our bets,' says Earnshaw. 'We have about 117 different varieties, which all come up at different times &mdash; from very early, like the variety called February Gold &mdash; to the latest such as pheasant eye, which won't come up until April or May. Therefore, some should be out at the right time.'</p>\n<p>The winter weather might be going mildly mad, but Thriplow's daffodil committee isn't daft.</p>\n<h3>Climate change played a role in record heat, say experts</h3>\n<p>Climate change has played a role in pushing winter temperatures to new record highs in the UK, experts have suggested.</p>\n<p>While the variability of weather makes it hard to link any single event to climate change, global warming is heating up the whole system and making extremes more likely, scientists say.</p>\n<p>The UK has seen a new record for winter temperatures set for the second time in two days, as the mercury climbed to 20.8C in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, North Wales.</p>\n<p>And there has been a run of warm weather, with daily maximum temperatures at Kew Gardens in London not dropping below the month's average of 7.4C since February 2, and staying above 15C for at least seven days.</p>\n<p>The weather is dramatically different to a year ago, when the first day of spring on March 1 saw the UK gripped by subzero temperatures.</p>\n<p>Grahame Madge, Met Office climate spokesman, said the warm conditions were caused by high pressure over western Europe, warm air coming from the south and dry conditions which helped warm the ground up more quickly.</p>\n<p>Those conditions, at the very end of winter, come against a backdrop of 1C of warming since pre-industrial times as a result of human activity, helping lead to record temperatures for the time of year.</p>\n<p>'Climate change has made what would have already been an extremely warm event even warmer and is probably responsible for tipping it over the 20C threshold,' he said.</p>\n<p>Dr Jo House, from the University of Bristol, said: 'Weather is always variable so it is hard to link a single event to climate change.</p>\n<p>'What we do know is that climate change is warming the whole system and makes events like these more likely to happen.</p>\n<p>'We can already observe clear trends in higher temperatures and earlier phenological events like flowers coming into bud in many regions throughout the world.</p>\n<p>'The longest running record of temperature measurements is in the UK and shows the last decade was 1C warmer than the pre-industrial period of 1850 to 1900. This is consistent with observations of global warming.'</p>\n<p>Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'</p>\n<p>He said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.</p>\n<p>'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.</p>",

Elsewhere in the country there have been reports of wildfires\nElsewhere on Tuesday the Moroccan air plume left beaches and parks surprisingly busy for February as sunseekers took full advantage of the winter respite and was so warm even pollinating bees were taking advantage of the heat wave.\nYesterday's hotspot was Kew Gardens in West London which hit 21.2C (70.2F) - but Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute at LSE has warned that although warmer winters might be pleasant, they are the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent.\nThe record breaking temperatures today came after Trawsgoed in West Wales had the highest temperature of 20.6C (68.5F) Monday, which broke a winter record of 19.7C (67.5F) in Greenwich, South East London, which had stood for two decades since 1998.\nWhy is it so hot in Britain?\nBritain has experienced an extraordinary few days of record-breaking temperatures for February.\nThe exceptionally warm weather is thanks to a block weather pattern which is dragging up warm air from the Canary Islands, Morocco and southern Spain.\nThe pattern is a large area of high pressure that moves in a clockwise direction bringing warm winds from the Canaries, meaning more sunlight.\nThe dry ground needs less energy to heat up and so it is becoming hotter more easily \u2013 which makes it very warm when combined with the southern air flow.\nConditions in Wales \u2013 which has recorded temperatures above 20C (68F) two days in a row - are being supercharged by the 'Foehn Effect' phenomenon.\nThis is where moist air dries out as it hits hills or mountains, allowing temperatures to rise further as the air comes down the other side.\nMeanwhile, conversely, temperatures in the usually warm Mediterranean have plunged.\nIn Thessaloniki in Greece, it hovered at around 3C and has even had snow, as have parts of Northwest Turkey that also saw wintery flurries.\nThe culprits are areas of low pressure over the Atlantic and Eastern Europe, trapping warm air over the northwest of the continent.\nThe day started with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rose to highs above 20C (68F) this afternoon. Another hotspot today was Porthmadog in North Wales which reached 20.8C (69.4F).\nThe warmth follows last February's Beast from the East, which plunged temperatures below freezing and brought heavy snowfall across the country.\nThe unseasonably warm weather is expected to continue for another day for most of Britain before parts of the country face possible thunderstorms later in the week, forecasters said.\nToday will be sunny with possible highs of 20C (68F) but is unlikely to continue a trend of record-breaking February temperatures set earlier in the week.\nMet Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said some parts of southern and western England could be facing thunder on Thursday.\n'Tomorrow will be pretty sunny again for most places,' he said on Tuesday evening.\n'There might be a little bit of mist and fog around to start with but that should largely clear.\n'It won't be quite as exceptionally warm so I don't think we will break the record we have reached today.'\nBob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'\nHe said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.\n'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.\nTomorrow will be slightly cooler but still above average for the time of year.\nHeavy showers are possible on Thursday as temperatures struggle to get above 12C (54F). Friday, March 1, will mark the first day of meteorological spring and is expected to be mostly dry before a wet weekend.\nMet Office meteorologist Luke Miall said: 'The weekend doesn't look great, it's looking wet and windy across the country. There's lots of uncertainty over the details because it's still a long way off but wet and windy seems to be the theme.'\nTemperatures recorded in Britain this week are hotter than the Algarve, where it was 18C (64.4F) yesterday. Malaga and Rome only managed a paltry 15C (59F).\nTuesday started with some light frost and fog before the temperatures rose to highs of about 20C (68F) in the afternoon\nToday will be slightly cooler but still above average for the time of year, before heavy showers are possible on Thursday\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nThe view through the Croft An Righ in Holyrood, Edinburgh yesterday (left) and during the Beast from the East last year (right)\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nEdinburgh is pictured in the sunshine yesterday (left) and in heavy snow during the Beast from the East last year (right)\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nThe M876 motorway in Scotland is pictured in the sunshine yesterday (left) and in January last year (right)\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nAn ice cream is held on the beach at Weston-Super-Mare (left) - while a handful of ice is also seen exactly one year ago (right)\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nTwo people walk their dogs at Weston-super-Mare this morning (left) on a much sunnier day than this time last year (right)\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a\nThe beach at Weston-super-Mare is a beautiful sight in the warm sunshine (left) and icy foam on the beach last year (right)\nA young woman lays amongst the crocuses as she enjoys the sunshine at Green Park in London yesterday\nTwo men sit on rocks with their tops off as they enjoy the sunshine at Woolacombe in North Devon yesterday\nPeople enjoy the sunshine on a bench as they enjoy the sunshine at Woolacombe in North Devon yesterday\nA surfer crosses the beach under cloudless skies at Woolacombe in North Devon yesterday\nTwo young women enjoy a drink at Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham in the sunshine yesterday\nPeople enjoy the sunshine during their lunch break at St James's Park in London yesterday\nA sailing boat sails past the coast of Dungeness in Kent during the morning sunshine yesterday\nA swan makes its way along the Forth and Clyde Canal near Falkirk in the warm weather yesterday\nAre the warmer winters a sign of climate change?\nWhile scientists are reluctant to attribute individual weather fronts such as heatwaves and droughts directly to climate change, there is little doubt that such events are getting more frequent as our planet heats.\nFriederike Otto, a researcher at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said: 'This is one of the clearest signs of climate change that we have seen, that winter temperatures are increasing and the likelihood of very warm days in winter has increased quite a lot.\n'The fact that spring starts much earlier is one of the very obvious signs of climate change that we see.'\nThe last four years have been the hottest on record, with 2018 ending as the fourth-hottest year ever, according to the United Nations.\nLast year alone saw devastating forest fires in Greece and California, a succession of superstorms in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and record-breaking drought in Australia.\nBob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'\nHe said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.\n'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.\nHolidaymakers hoping to catch rays in Crete will be bitterly disappointed, with the island seeing 1.2in (300mm) of rain yesterday and a maximum temperature of 13C (56F) forecast for today.\nMonday's record highs were likened to a 'climate breakdown' by Green MP Caroline Lucas. Mr Miall said: 'This kind of event is what climate change would expect but we can't directly relate it to climate change.'\nConditions in Wales were being supercharged by a phenomenon known as the 'Foehn Effect', where moist air dries out as it hits hills or mountains, allowing temperatures to rise further as the air comes down the other side.\nMr Miall added: 'The reason we've got this exceptionally warm weather is all down to a block weather pattern. This is dragging up warm air from the Canary Islands and southern Spain.'\nWhile most of the country is basking in sunshine, spare a thought for Quidnish on the Isle of Harris. It was the wettest place in Britain with 10.4mm (0.4in) of rain yesterday, the Met Office said.\nPeople enjoy the sunshine today at Greys Court in Rotherfield Greys, Oxfordshire\nEarly morning light at Inverleith Park in Edinburgh today ahead of more warm temperatures for Britain on the way\nA jogger makes their way towards Parliament Square in London today as daytime temperatures stay well above average\nThe Winston Churchill statue is photographed in the morning sun at Parliament Square in London today\nThe sun begins to rise over Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire today as warm weather continues to sweep the country\nA paddle boarder and surfer take to the sea as the sun rises over Boscombe beach in Dorset this morning\nThe blue hour at St Mary's Lighthouse in Whitley Bay today as Britain could experience more record-breaking temperatures\nThe sun rises behind the Forth Bridge at North Queensferry in Fife this morning on another unseasonably warm day\nA montage of the sunrise over the North Sea in Whitley Bay today as the UK could experience more record-breaking warmth\nNature kicks off spring in response to warm weather\nThe unseasonably warm weather has prompted birds to try nesting, butterflies to emerge and hedgehogs to come out of hibernation early, experts said.\nMigrant swallows and house martins have even been spotted arriving in the UK more than a month early, the RSPB said.\nConservationists are warning the early start to spring, which they say could be linked to climate change, could lead to a 'real crisis' for nature if the weather reverts to colder conditions, such as those seen in March last year.\nA pollinating bee is pictured seen covered in pollen in an undisclosed location\nThe warning comes after the UK saw the warmest winter day since records began, with temperatures topping 20C (68F) in several places on Monday, and forecasts suggesting the mercury could rise to near-records again on Tuesday.\nThe RSPB's wildlife team has been getting calls from people reporting early nesting attempts and even ducklings being spotted across the country.\nThere are also reports of hibernating hedgehogs and some reptiles waking up earlier than usual and butterflies emerging prompted by the warm weather.\nBirds are travelling ahead of the 'Saharan plume' of warm air which is bringing the mild temperatures to the UK, with reports of swallows and house martins in Cornwall, Devon and South Wales weeks early, the RSPB said.\nMartin Harper, the charity's director of global conservation, said: 'While the warm weather, bright sunshine and abundant sights and sounds of nature undoubtedly make us all feel better, they should also ring alarm bells.\n'The early signs of spring are likely down to climate change, which is bad news for us all.\n'As we expect the weather to return to temperatures more traditionally associated with this time of year - as they are forecast to - then there could be a real crisis for our birds, insects and other wildlife.'\nThe Woodland Trust's Nature's Calendar scheme, which asks the public to track signs of the seasons, has been receiving unusually early records of spring this winter - with some as early as November.\nMild weather has led to records in January of red admiral, small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies and queen wasps, which are usually seen in mid to late February or early March.\nTrees including field maples and European larches have been bursting into bud early and blue tits have been spotted making nesting attempts as early as Boxing Day.\nThe latest bout of unseasonably warm weather has seen more than 250 records of brimstone butterflies emerging for the first time since February 12, with 163 of the sightings taking place since Friday.\nThe butterfly normally comes out around March or April, the Trust said.\nAbi Bunker, director of conservation and external affairs at the Woodland Trust, said: 'Nature's Calendar data has increasingly brought into question the way we think about the seasons and to see spring in December no longer seems unusual.\n'With butterflies, bumblebees and snowdrops being recorded across the festive period, we may have to start featuring different species on our Christmas cards.\n'But the Nature's Calendar project is more than just spotting the seasons; data sent in by members of the public enables greater understanding of the repercussions climate change has for our beloved flora and fauna, and of the need to act to tackle global warming and other threats to our wildlife.'\nWhy spring in February is a disaster for nature: Yes, it's a joy to see butterflies and blooms burst forth this early in the year... but there may yet be a chilling price to pay, writes JOHN NAISH\nBy JOHN NAISH FOR THE DAILY MAIL\nOn Sunday afternoon I was sitting in the garden in a T-shirt, taking a break from some urgent pruning. On a fallen tree trunk nearby a Red Admiral was basking, its pulsing wings blissfully warmed by the sun beaming down from a clear blue sky.\nJust as it did again today \u2014 and, if the forecasters are right, for the rest of the week.\nIt is utterly gorgeous \u2014 but worrying. It's only February, for goodness sake! We should all still be shivering in the depths of winter.\nInstead, this past glorious weekend the roads around my home town of Brighton were rammed with sunseekers heading for the beach.\nWe tried to escape the melee by heading to a quiet country pub. Quiet? We had to queue for a table in the flower-dappled garden. It felt like a May bank holiday.\nNature clearly thinks that spring has sprung and then some. Parks and gardens are clad in golden daffodils. Snowdrops are in full bloom on our lawn. Witch hazel and honeysuckles are already emerging.\nAnd I'm in a panic about pruning back our rampant fig trees. They should still be sound asleep, but instead they are budding wildly.\nFifteen-month-old Darcy and her mother Kerry enjoy the sunshine and warm weather at Parade Gardens in Bath yesterday\nAround Britain the story is the same: some species of camellia are making a premature appearance, patches of wild primroses (usually March to May) and even early cherry blossom (March), while scabious, poppies and Virginia stock have stayed in flower since the summer, having apparently forgotten to die back, thanks to a balmy autumn.\nThe animal kingdom is stirring prematurely, too. Naturalists report that the dawn chorus \u2014 not usually heard until March \u2014 began at the start of this month.\nSong thrushes are even belting out their mating calls, while bees have been tricked out of hibernation many weeks early. And as for that butterfly in my garden, well I've never spotted one so early in the year before.\nFor this latest burst of unseasonal balm \u2014 following a remarkably mild winter \u2014 we can thank a plume of warm southerly air sweeping up from the Canary Islands, sending temperatures into the high teens.\nThat is more than twice the normal February average.\nIn London's Kew Gardens the highs have nudged 18c. 'This year is particularly mild,' says Guy Barter, the chief horticulturalist at the Royal Horticultural Society.\n'There are a lot of things in flower that you would not expect at this time of the year. Things are running ahead of normal.'\nIndeed. The Met Office confirmed that today was the hottest February on record as temperatures reached 20.3c in parts of Wales.\nA group of women enjoy lunch in the sun at Blyth in Northumberland yesterday as the UK enjoys an unseasonably warm day\nBut it's not just the sunny West and South (19c) that's ablaze. The warmest yet February day in Scotland was recorded last week when Aboyne in Aberdeenshire hit 18.3c on Thursday afternoon.\nThis beats the previous high of 17.9c recorded in Aberdeen in February 1897. (One wonders if they were fretting about climate change back then.)\nAll in all it made for a spectacular weekend for most of us \u2014 with the best part of another week of this weather to come \u2014 and will be welcome when we get our heating bills.\nHowever, the unexpected warmth is sowing much confusion in the natural world and threatens summer harvests, especially for fruit growers.\nMany of Britain's plants have evolved to use winter's cold to their advantage. In the same way that our bodies need eight hours of sleep in each 24-hour cycle, plants need a period of dormancy during the colder months if they are to thrive in spring.\nThis process, called vernalisation, requires a sustained period of cold \u2014 which the plants take as an instruction to re-set their biological clocks in preparation for a new healthy annual cycle.\nFor fruit trees, this is not just desirable but vital. Plants such as figs need about 300 chill hours when the temperature is between 0-7c to thrive. Softer fruit such as blackcurrants can require up to 2,000 chill hours to flower at the right time.\nA bee takes pollen from a spring bloom in St James's Park in London yesterday\nIf the mild weather persists, fruit trees may flower too early \u2014 in March or April. 'They would then be vulnerable to a sharp frost that would destroy their blossom,' warns Barter. 'If that happens, they would bear no fruit.'\nAnd if apple, pear or blackcurrant plants flower early, they may do so at a time when there are fewer bees about, with a good chance they would not then be pollinated and so would not fruit.\nIt's a huge worry for orchard owners \u2014 as well as Britain's 40 or so commercial blackcurrant growers, who produce about 14,000 tons of fruit each year.\nButterflies may also suffer. The winter of 2015 was a warm one \u2014 and what followed was a terrible year for these insects.\nCold weather kills viruses and bacteria in the soil that many insects, including native species of butterflies and moths, are high vulnerable to. If temperatures stay relatively high, the microbes can decimate insect populations.\nData gathered by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, from more than 1,800 sites across the country over 37 years, shows higher temperatures affected more than half the species, such as the common blue, comma, peacock and small tortoiseshells.\nThere is then a knock-on effect on our native birds which, if they mate and lay eggs early, won't be able to find enough insects to feed their chicks.\nAnalysis by conservationists of 30,000 nests over the past decade shows birds such as the chaffinch and the robin lay eggs about a week earlier than in the Sixties. A similar pattern has been seen for blue tits, great tits and swallows.\nAnd if a proper cold snap should interrupt our mild winter in a month or so, vulnerable chicks could struggle to survive.\nA bee collects pollen at National Trust's Wallington Hall, near Morpeth in Northumberland last Friday\nIndeed, forecasters are warning that this warm snap may come to a bitter end.\nMeteorologists predict that early March will bring fierce weather sweeping in from the Atlantic, with gales and snow blasting parts of Britain. Spring still holds an icy shard in its heart.\nIndeed, the mild winter to date may be creating the same meteorological conditions that prompted the bitter blast of prolonged cold from Siberia \u2014 dubbed the Beast from the East \u2014 to come roaring in this time last year.\nThis involves a phenomenon called 'sudden stratospheric warming' where layers of air high in the stratosphere above us become unseasonably warm and the resultant change in pressure sucks in freezing air from Siberia.\nHow do wildfires start?\nGrass fires can develop quickly in dry conditions and raised winds with the possibility of quickly spreading.\nThey are often caused deliberately by people, but can also happen when controlled fires get out of hand.\nNorth Wales Fire and Rescue Service said deliberate mountain fires have a 'hugely detrimental' impact on wildlife and the environment.\nWhen road access is not possible to fight them, then they are often left to burn themselves out.\nEvery plant, insect and bird that thought spring had come early would suffer if this is the case.\nGardeners and lovers of wildlife are keeping their fingers crossed that any cold snap in the next few weeks will be short \u2014 and may actually re-set Nature's clock.\n'It would return fruit-tree flowering to its normal season and be welcomed by most farmers and fruit growers,' Mr Barter says.\nThe price we may pay, though, is a depressingly bloom-free gap in spring. That's a worry for the 450 residents of Thriplow in Cambridgeshire, who hope to celebrate their 50th Daffodil Fair.\nOver the past five decades, they have planted more than half a million bulbs around the village and their annual fund-raising weekend near the end of March is a national event, with up to 14,000 people flocking to see the spectacle.\nLast year, though, the entire weekend was laid waste by the Beast from the East.\nThis year, the number of daffodils could also be depleted.\n'Some daffs are already out in the village,' says Paul Earnshaw, who is chair of the Fair's charity committee.\n'Daffs do what daffs do. People say that you can hurry them up by putting a hairdryer on them \u2014 or more sensibly, by growing them under polytunnels.\n'But if they are coming up early, then you can't stop them \u2014 you can only be glad to see them.'\nNevertheless, the village has developed another strategy to ensure a good display.\n'We spread our bets,' says Earnshaw. 'We have about 117 different varieties, which all come up at different times \u2014 from very early, like the variety called February Gold \u2014 to the latest such as pheasant eye, which won't come up until April or May. Therefore, some should be out at the right time.'\nThe winter weather might be going mildly mad, but Thriplow's daffodil committee isn't daft.\nClimate change played a role in record heat, say experts\nClimate change has played a role in pushing winter temperatures to new record highs in the UK, experts have suggested.\nWhile the variability of weather makes it hard to link any single event to climate change, global warming is heating up the whole system and making extremes more likely, scientists say.\nThe UK has seen a new record for winter temperatures set for the second time in two days, as the mercury climbed to 20.8C in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, North Wales.\nAnd there has been a run of warm weather, with daily maximum temperatures at Kew Gardens in London not dropping below the month's average of 7.4C since February 2, and staying above 15C for at least seven days.\nThe weather is dramatically different to a year ago, when the first day of spring on March 1 saw the UK gripped by subzero temperatures.\nGrahame Madge, Met Office climate spokesman, said the warm conditions were caused by high pressure over western Europe, warm air coming from the south and dry conditions which helped warm the ground up more quickly.\nThose conditions, at the very end of winter, come against a backdrop of 1C of warming since pre-industrial times as a result of human activity, helping lead to record temperatures for the time of year.\n'Climate change has made what would have already been an extremely warm event even warmer and is probably responsible for tipping it over the 20C threshold,' he said.\nDr Jo House, from the University of Bristol, said: 'Weather is always variable so it is hard to link a single event to climate change.\n'What we do know is that climate change is warming the whole system and makes events like these more likely to happen.\n'We can already observe clear trends in higher temperatures and earlier phenological events like flowers coming into bud in many regions throughout the world.\n'The longest running record of temperature measurements is in the UK and shows the last decade was 1C warmer than the pre-industrial period of 1850 to 1900. This is consistent with observations of global warming.'\nBob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Today's record for the UK's winter temperature is consistent with the clear climate change signal that we are seeing in the UK.'\nHe said the climate was transforming towards warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers - such as last year's heatwave summer - with impacts on people and wildlife.\n'While warmer winters might seem pleasant for many people, it is worth remembering that this is the result of a climate change trend that is also making heatwaves and heavy rainfall more frequent, as well as coastal flooding due to sea level rise,' he said.",

allegations, that hasn't worked.</p>\n<h3>Tommy Robinson's full statement on the ban </h3>\n<p>The 36-year-old activist believes he has been banned from Facebook and Instagram due to a documentary he made in which he argued that media coverage of him was biased.</p>\n<p>He said: 'This is in response to my expose documentary called Panadrama, which exposed the establishment working with Hope not Hate, working along with the media, in order to bring me down and destroy me.</p>\n<p>'Now they have realised that that has not worked, they're working with the tech giants to remove us completely</p>\n<p>'Where is free speech? I've breached no laws of Facebook, everyone is going to know that I've breached no rules, what I've done is shown people the truth and that is what they are removing, the truth. People will still find me.</p>\n<p>'People will be astonished by this censorship, especially witnessing it in response to my expose documentary.'</p>\n<p>'Now, the establishment, which has gone for the plan of completely removing me from the public sphere - people will fight against this censorship, people will not like this censorship.</p>\n<p>'You're not just censoring me, you're censoring the public's option of listening to what I have to say. This is a complete attack on free speech which is going on across the world.'</p>\n<p>A spokesman for Momentum, the grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, said: 'Hate speech isn't free speech and spreading racist lies shouldn't be tolerated on our shared digital platforms.'</p>\n<p>Emails and tweets from Tommy Robinson were used as evidence in the trial of Darren Osborne, who was convicted of murder for driving a van into worshippers outside two mosques in London, to show his path of 'radicalisation' before committing the attack in June 2017.</p>\n<p>Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation who has campaigned against grooming gangs in Rochdale from within the Pakistani community, said he welcomed the ban and claimed he had met with Facebook representatives to 'discuss the concern of the British Muslim community that Tommy Robinson's continued presence on social media was leading to further radicalisation of his supporters'.</p>\n<p>'This is not about free speech or silencing criticism or questioning of Islam and Muslims, this is about hate speech and hatred towards one community,' Mr Shafiq said, adding that he had contacted Google and YouTube to urge them to take similar action.</p>\n<figure><video

                "text": "Facebook deleted Tommy Robinson's private profile, public page and Instagram account this afternoon.\nThe social media giant accused the English Defence League founder of encouraging violence against Muslims online.\nMr Robinson, 36, has hit back claiming that the ban is due to a film he made accusing mainstream media of demonising him and slammed the move as 'censorship'.\nTommy Robinson (pictured) has been removed from the platform and accused of calling for violence against Muslims\nThis is what will greet followers hoping to gain access to Tommy Robinson's Facebook page\nInstagram has also removed the EDL founder's account, Facebook has revealed today\nThe Pegida UK founder - who was banned from Twitter in March last year - boasted more than a million followers on his main Facebook page until the site kicked him off today.\nFacebook said in a statement that when opinions amount to hate speech that may intimidate certain groups in society it must 'take action'.\nThe site accused Mr Robinson of 'repeatedly' flouting rules designed to prevent 'organised hate' on the site.\n'Tommy Robinson's Facebook Page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanizing language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims,' it said.\nTommy Robinson (pictured with supporters after his contempt of court hearing was adjourned last October) has now been banned from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\nTommy Robinson (pictured addressing a rally in Salford, Greater Manchester on Sunday) has now been banned from three major social media platforms\nMr Robinson said he had not heard of his ban from Facebook, claiming the 'corrupt media and the establishment' were trying 'to silence any opposition to their globalist plans'.\nHe added: 'When putting me in prison and trying to kill me hasn't worked, when then trying to get mainstream documentaries to destroy my name with false allegations, that hasn't worked.\nTommy Robinson's full statement on the ban\nThe 36-year-old activist believes he has been banned from Facebook and Instagram due to a documentary he made in which he argued that media coverage of him was biased.\nHe said: 'This is in response to my expose documentary called Panadrama, which exposed the establishment working with Hope not Hate, working along with the media, in order to bring me down and destroy me.\n'Now they have realised that that has not worked, they're working with the tech giants to remove us completely\n'Where is free speech? I've breached no laws of Facebook, everyone is going to know that I've breached no rules, what I've done is shown people the truth and that is what they are removing, the truth. People will still find me.\n'People will be astonished by this censorship, especially witnessing it in response to my expose documentary.'\n'Now, the establishment, which has gone for the plan of completely removing me from the public sphere - people will fight against this censorship, people will not like this censorship.\n'You're not just censoring me, you're censoring the public's option of listening to what I have to say. This is a complete attack on free speech which is going on across the world.'\nA spokesman for Momentum, the grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, said: 'Hate speech isn't free speech and spreading racist lies shouldn't be tolerated on our shared digital platforms.'\nEmails and tweets from Tommy Robinson were used as evidence in the trial of Darren Osborne, who was convicted of murder for driving a van into worshippers outside two mosques in London, to show his path of 'radicalisation' before committing the attack in June 2017.\nMohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation who has campaigned against grooming gangs in Rochdale from within the Pakistani community, said he welcomed the ban and claimed he had met with Facebook representatives to 'discuss the concern of the British Muslim community that Tommy Robinson's continued presence on social media was leading to further radicalisation of his supporters'.\n'This is not about free speech or silencing criticism or questioning of Islam and Muslims, this is about hate speech and hatred towards one community,' Mr Shafiq said, adding that he had contacted Google and YouTube to urge them to take similar action.\nSupporters of Tommy Robinson waved flags as they showed out to back the EDL founder while he faced the courts last year\nThe EDL founder and self-styled journalist is pictured being arrested while filming outside court, which he was told put a grooming trial at risk\nFans of Tommy Robinson lined the street in October last year outside the Old Bailey in central London as he faced court\nTommy Robinson shared this Instagram snap when he was on the way to the Old Bailey for his court appearance, during which supporters showed their support for him outside\nIn January YouTube blocked Mr Robinson from making money from his videos.\nThe Google-owned video platform stopped his channel, which has nearly 300,000 subscribers, from advertising under rules preventing 'hate speech'.\nThe ban came one day after YouTube removed adverts for Britain First from the platform for breaching rules which prohibit content promoting 'hatred, intolerance or discrimination'.\n'We have suspended ads on Tommy Robinson's YouTube channel as it breaches our advertising policies,' a YouTube spokesperson had said.\nRobinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, claimed the incident was 'censorship'.\nLast year he was banned from Twitter and online payment platform PayPal, both of which cited their rules on hate speech as reasons.\nToday's Facebook and Instagram bans have received a mixed response on social media, with some expressing concerns that it is an attempt to shut down free speech, others alleging that it is in response to Mr Robinson's recent film, which was the focus of a rally in Salford this week.\nSome critics of the activist - who has also worked as a journalist for Rebel Media - have welcomed the measure.\nPressure group Hope Not Hate welcomed the decision today to remove profiles belonging to Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.\nIts chief executive said: 'Stephen Lennon is a far-right thug who uses his platform to bully, abuse and stir up division, monetising his hatred to earn huge sums while hiding behind a fake free speech mantle.\n'Lennon has a long record of abuse towards minorities such as Muslims, so we welcome today's decision as well as Facebook's continued actions in cleaning up their platform.'\nIt comes just days after Mr Robinson appeared to make racist comments while asking for a taxi driver, which he described as 'little p*** that drives a car' in a drunken video.\nIn the video, which he shot on his phone, he also rants about being 'the king of the whole Islam race' and fighting for Israel if war broke out with Palestine.\nGoing on Facebook to respond shortly after the video was published by The Sun on February 13, Robinson said the video was shared between friends in a private group.\nHe claimed he was very drunk when the video was made and his comments were 'banter' after he also bragged he could score 'gear' in the country.\nHe denied he had bought drugs in Qatar, which he claimed was near-impossible, and said Asian and black friends were in the messaging group with whom he shared the video.\nLast month, YouTube suspended adverts on Robinson's account, saying he breached rules which prohibit the promotion of 'hatred, intolerance and discrimination'.\nMr Robinson also waded into a row following the targeting of a Syrian refugee at a school near Huddersfield.\nA bully was filmed headbutting a 16-year-old called Jamal before dragging him to the floor, pouring water over his face and threatening to drown him.\nFollowing the incident, Mr Robinson took to Facebook to falsely accused the victim of attacking three English girls and a boy.\nLast month the youngster's family announced that it was pursuing legal action against Facebook for allowing 'defamation' on the social media platform.\nProfile: Who is Tommy Robinson?\nTommy Robinson (pictured outside the Old Bailey in October last year) has been banned from Facebook\nTommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, describes himself as a 'journalist, activist and public figure fighting for the forgotten people of the UK'.\nThe 36-year-old founded the English Defence League in 2009, taking the name of a renowned football hooligan from his home town of Luton.\nHe quit the EDL in 2013 as he admitted the group was suffering from 'dangers of far-right extremism'.\nHe pledged to work with Maajid Nawaz, co-founder of the Quilliam Foundation, to help reform Islam and fight extremism by working with Muslims in the UK.\nBut after their relationship deteriorated, he founded Pegida UK in 2015.

                "text": "Under pointed questioning from senators, the top U.S. general for homeland defense said Tuesday that he sees no military threat coming from the southern border with Mexico, but his focus in on 'very real' threats from China and Russia in the north.\nAir Force Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander, U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, told a Senate committee that proposed barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border could increase security against any potential military threats coming from the south. But he said Russia's advancements in training and capabilities, and its intent to hold the U.S. at risk, present an urgent threat to America.\nPresident Donald Trump has declared a national emergency along the southern border to fund his proposed wall, and he plans to use Defense Department funds from military construction and counter-drug programs to pay for it. Members of Congress are challenging that.\nAir Force Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander, U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, made the declaration\nDemocratic senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee peppered O'Shaughnessy with questions about the need to divert the money from existing projects and questioned the validity of a national emergency declaration.\n'I'm concerned, very frankly, that this administration is politicizing our military and militarizing our immigration policy - in effect, using the troops under your command as political props, both in terms of declaring a fake emergency but also compromising our potential security by diverting them away from other assignments and missions that are absolutely necessary,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.\nThe meeting comes as the Democratic-controlled House was planning a vote Tuesday to revoke Trump's emergency declaration, and send legislation to the Republican-held Senate, where it would take only a handful of GOP defections to pass it.\nO'Shaughnessy, who visited the southern border on Saturday with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, was careful to defer any assessment of the southern threat to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. He said that those agencies believe that more fencing can impact the movement of drugs across the border.\nO'Shaughnessy said he would defer to DHS 'on the character of the threat,' adding that Northern Command is trying to 'be a good partner' as the other agencies take on the drug trafficking challenge. Asked if it is a national emergency, he said, it is a 'national issue' that requires a 'whole-of-government approach.'\nSen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., questioned whether Congress should allow Trump to use Pentagon money for a non-defense emergency.\n'The threat isn't military, and still we'll take $6 billion out of the defense budget to deal with it?' said Kaine. 'If we set that precedent, I certainly can foresee a day when a president is going to say 40,000 gun deaths a year are an emergency, and why don't we take money out of the Pentagon budget to deal with that?'\nSen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, argued that the shipment of illegal drugs from Mexico into the U.S. has caused tens of thousands of deaths, and that it constituted an emergency. But he also endorsed O'Shaughnessy's assertion that Russia's expanding fleet of icebreakers in the Arctic present a serious threat, and the U.S. needs to increase its capabilities there.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard currently has one working Polar-class icebreaker ship, but there's funding in the Defense Department budget to begin building more. Sullivan said the poor condition of the U.S. ship is a disgrace, and the U.S. needs more ability to counter Russia and China in the arctic.",

He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.</p>\n<p>And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Campaign role: Paul Manafort chaired Trump's campaign for four months - which included the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016, where he appeared on stage beside Trump who was preparing\u00a0 to formally accept the Republican nomination\" data-src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/00/4EB2CEFF00000578-6068591-Campaign_role_Paul_Manafort_chaired_Trump_s_campaign_for_four_mo-m-9_1534892774373.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\"></img></figure>\n<p>GUILTY AND JAILED: PAUL MANAFORT</p>\n<p>Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018.

He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts in August 2018. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent due in September did not happen when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and witness tampering in a plea bargain.

                "text": "A Republican congressman took a page from Donald Trump's book Tuesday by accusing the president's former fixer Michael Cohen, without evidence, of having multiple affairs - on the eve of the ex-attorney giving blockbuster public testimony when he will call his former boss a liar, a criminal and a racist.\nGOP Rep. Matt Gaetz said in a Tuesday afternoon tweet that Cohen's wife, Lauren, and her father should talk to the disgraced attorney, suggesting in a tweet that he was hiding more than one illicit relationship from his family.\n'Hey @MichaelCohen212 - Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot...' he tweeted.\nJust over an house later a Democratic member of the committee, New Jersey congressman Bill Pascrell, demanded that Gaetz be investigated for attempting to intimidate a witness.\nTrump has said publicly that journalists should look into Cohen's father-in-law, Fima Shusterman and hinted that he is in some way involved in fraud.\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\nA Republican congressman took a page from Donald Trump's book and accused the president's former fixer, without evidence, of having multiple affairs\nFamily: Michael Cohen and his wife Lauren (right) share two children, Samantha (left) and Jake (second from left)\nCohen's testimony on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to the Senate Intelligence Committee was classified. He'll be grilled publicly on Wednesday by lawmakers who sit on House Oversight.\nWhen he left the Senate committee he did not address the cheating claims but said: 'At this point in time I really appreciate the opportunity that was given to me to clear the record, to tell the truth and I look forward to tomorrow to be able in my voice to tell the American people my story and I'm going to let the American people decide exactly who is telling the truth.'\nIn an phone interview with the Daily Beast after his tweet, Gaetz, who is not on Oversight, insisted he's not attempting to intimidate Cohen.\nHe said said he was merely 'challenging the veracity and character of a witness' before Cohen's public testimony.\n'We do it everyday. We typically do it during people's testimony,' he said. 'This is what it looks like to compete in the marketplace of ideas.'\nGaetz insisted that he was not directed to issue the tweet by the Trump or anyone inside the administration. He did not tell the Daily Beast how he knew about Cohen's alleged philandering, either.\nHe told the publication he believes that Cohen's marriage is fair game, because it speaks to the 'veracity' of the congressman's testimony. One of Cohen's admitted crimes is deceit.\nCohen apologized to senators on Tuesday for lying in previous testimony as he started three days of testimony on Capitol Hill, where the topics will include racist remarks he's heard from the president and allegations of criminal activity on the part of Trump.\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told DailyMail.com that Cohen - who pleaded guilty to lying to Congress - appeared credible to lawmakers and apologized to them.\n'He appeared credible to me today, and he apologized, he said he was going away, you know, he understands, and I think he made efforts to be absolutely truthful,' she said.\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told DailyMail.com that Cohen - who pled guilty to lying to Congress - appeared credible to lawmakers and apologized\nCohen's credibility has been questioned given his admission he lied to lawmakers when he appeared before the House and Senate intelligence committees in 2017.\nFeinstein declined to offer specific details on what Cohen, who was known as Trump's fixer, discussed with committee members.\n'The part I was in, which is about two hours, umm, he answered questions, he was really \u2013 it's classified, so I can't tell you much. I think that most of us know that this is very complicated picture,' she said.\nCohen's appearance on Tuesday was behind closed doors so lawmakers could grill him on a variety of matters, including Trump's business dealings with Russia.\nAdditionally Cohen will offer senators a document that he claims shows the president engaged in criminal conduct around the hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, it was revealed Tuesday.\nThe document will refute a claim by Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani that Cohen used a $35,000 monthly retainer from the president as reimbursement for paying off Daniels, a source close to Cohen told Politico.\nGiuliani has said Cohen used a monthly retainer made for legal services in reimbursement as repayment for the $130,000 given to Daniels in exchange for her silence.\nThe documents will show who signed the checks to Cohen, the Daily Beast reported.\nAs he gave evidence Cohen also learned that he was disbarred in New York because of his felony conviction in a ruling which prevents him practicing law. He had not attempted to fight the move.\nCohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign-finance laws by facilitating payments to Daniels.\nCohen will also discuss the BuzzFeed report that Trump ordered him to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal. The article earned a rare - if carefully worded - denial from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office.\n'He'll explain exactly why he lied and how he came to lie,' said the source told Politico.\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins told reporters Cohen was receiving an 'extensive grilling' from the intelligence panel.\nBut the White House voiced anger at the ex-fixer's high-profile session.\n'It's laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies,' Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.\nCohen arrived on Capitol Hill Tuesday morning to the flash of cameras lights and shouted questions but he didn't say a word as he walked into the Senate hearing room with Lanny Davis, the former Bill Clinton advisor who is acting as his attorney, and begins the first of three days of hearings.\nHe arrived 30 minutes before his time before senators was set to begin and is expected to be behind closed doors all day.\nSenators trickled into the hearing room after his arrival but few spoke about what they wanted to ask the president's former fixer.\nSome, however, offered hints at what they were looking for.\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden told reporters outside the hearing room he's interested in following the money when it comes to Cohen's work on Trump Tower Moscow.\nBut one issue he wouldn't touch was whether Cohen \u2013 who plead guilty to lying to Congress \u2013 can be trusted to tell the truth in this appearance.\n'I'll leave it at that,' Wyden said when asked that question.\nDemocratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, as he entered the hearing room, said he was looking for 'the truth.'\nIn his testimony, Cohen also intends to reveal information about Trump's financial statements, an anonymous source told the network.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the ex-fixer would accuse Trump of using racist language, recount times when the president questioned the 'intelligence' and criticized the 'lifestyle choices' of black people.\nThe fixer-turned-felon will say he witnessed 'lies, racism and cheating,' it reported.\nHe was on his way to raise his hand before the Senate Intelligence Committee to kick off a three-day, back-to-back trio of appearances on Capitol Hill where he will face multiple grillings from lawmakers on his relationship with President Donald Trump and his guilty plea to lying to Congress.\nCohen's closed-door testimony is a prelude to his public appearance on Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, to be followed by a second private session on Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee.\nWednesday's public hearing will overshadow the others merely by the presence of TV cameras, to which both Cohen and the lawmakers will be playing to as they engage in a verbal parley on a variety of issues, including the building of Trump Tower Moscow, the payoffs to women during the 2016 campaign, Trump's business dealings, and donations to the president's inaugural committee.\nLawmakers are also girding to ask him questions about a planned Moscow tower project that he pursued well into the 2016 presidential campaign. He plans to tell lawmakers Trump asked him about it 'several times.'\nHe further plans to talk about Trump's 'lies, racism and cheating as a private businessman,' according to the account.\nTrump and his legal team have repeatedly branded Cohen as a liar, and say he cooperated with prosecutors and furnished false information to get a reduced jail sentence.\nBut one topic not the public agenda: Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any possible collusion between Trump's team and Moscow.\nOversight panel chairman Elijah Cummings coordinated with his counterpart on the House Intel panel, Adam Schiff, and the two agreed the Russia conversation will happen discussed behind closed doors at the intelligence session while Trump's business dealings will be the focus of the public hearing, according to a memo released Sunday by the Oversight panel.\nLawmakers can dismiss the chairman's guidance and ask whatever they chose, but Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, also said his client cannot talk about the Russia probe in public.\nSenators, meanwhile, are eager to have Cohen in their crosshairs on Tuesday.\n'I think the reason you have him back is, when somebody lies to Congress in an investigation like this, the questions you might have asked the next witness don't get asked. Somebody you might have called doesn't get called,' Senate intelligence panel member Sen. Roy Blunt said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'\nInside man: Michael Cohen was with Trump for a decade and took part in his campaign - standing with (from left) Karen and Mike Pence, Omarosa Manigault - then a Trump aide, now being sued by his campaign for her memoir - and Don King during a campaign stop at the New Spirit Revival Center church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in September 2016\nHowever, Republicans are already preparing to cast doubts on Cohen's credibility - one of Trump's legal team's major arguments against the president's former personal attorney.\n'I don't know that we believe him this time,' Blunt noted.\nRepublicans will be just as hard on Cohen as Democrats, particularly those closed tied to the president.\nRepublican Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, two of Trump's staunches allies on Capitol Hill, sent a letter to Cohen's attorneys last week saying they intend to press the president's former personal lawyer on his questionable business dealings, his lies to Congress, his work for foreign entities, and even 'the fake Women for Cohen social media initiative he commissioned.'\nOne person who won't be in town for the show is President Trump, who jetted off to Vietnam on Monday for his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But he will have the ability to tweet even with the 12 hour time difference.\nThis week marks Cohen's first time before lawmakers since he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timing of talks concerning the building of a Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 presidential campaign.\nLawmakers have indicated that will be a major topic of interest.\n'Well, a great deal starting with why the false statements before our committee when he first appeared. Did they go beyond what he told us about Moscow Trump Tower into other areas as well?,' House Intelligence panel chair Rep. Adam Schiff said on ABC's 'This Week' on Sunday.\nDemocratic Rep. Jim Himes, who also sits on the Intelligence panel, said he wants to know the same.\n'Well, you know, Michael Cohen is going to jail for lying to my committee. So obviously, step one is to re-ask him the questions that he felt he needed to lie to us about, when he testified in the last Congress. So we're going to want to get to the truth, allow him to correct the record. And then, of course, the question is, okay, now that we know the truth, what are the follow-ups? It's going to be an interesting week in that regard,' he said Sunday on NBC's 'Meet the Press.'\nDemocratic Reps. Elijah Cummings (left) and Adam Schiff (right) will chair Wednesday's and Thursday's House hearings respectively\nHimes also said Cohen could be more forthcoming behind closed doors than in Wednesday's public circus.\n'I don't think he's going to say a lot that is classified. But he may have some things that he doesn't feel comfortable saying publicly that he then wants to say either to the Senate or to the House Intelligence Committees, in closed session,' he said.\nLast week, Cohen got a two-month reprieve from his deadline to report for his three years in jail, with a judge giving him until May 6. One of the reasons cited was his upcoming congressional testimony.\nCohen received a three-year sentence in December for bank and tax fraud, lying to Congress and violating campaign finance laws.\nEven though Cohen can't talk about in public what he told Robert Mueller in the 70 hours he spent talking to that team for the special counsel's Russia investigation, he will speak publicly about his relationship with the president.\nCohen attorney Lanny Davis said last Tuesday his client will reveal how Trump is 'bigoted,' 'treats people badly,' and talk about he's heard the president say disparaging things about black people behind closed doors.\n'I believe the issue in 2020 which Michael Cohen can speak to better than anyone is the man lacks character,' Davis told ABC's 'The Investigation' podcast. 'He speaks in bigoted words in private, which Michael Cohen will tell you. He treats people badly. He has no moral character in defrauding people in his businesses, and going bankrupt, and taking cash out, and putting people out of work. He lacks the moral compass that we expect in our presidents.'\nBut Davis said Cohen will be able to talk about 'what did you do for Mr. Trump for all those years and why.'\nTrump's legal team has already made their case against Cohen by painting him as an unreliable witness.\nBoth Trump's lawyers and the president himself have pushed back against any comments Cohen may have made to Mueller or will make in public by labeling him as a rat and turn coat who can't be believed.\nDavis conceded that Cohen knows he has a 'deep hole to climb out' of in terms of credibility.\nBut he argued his client has seen the light and wants to make amends for his past work for the president.\n'He wouldn't take a pardon if Trump pleaded with him to take it. Why? Because it would be dirty,' Davis told ABC News.\nCohen has been cooperating with the special counsel's probe of Russia's role in the 2016 election. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was the lead federal prosecutor earlier this year when Cohen pled guilty to eight counts, including tax fraud and campaign finance violations - that stemmed from the special counsel's investigation.\nCohen also has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the timeline of conversations he had with Russian officials about building a Trump Tower Moscow as part of separate investigation by Mueller's team.\nHe was sentenced to three years in prison and is free on bail until that time.\nCohen's guilty pleas included a charge of lying to Congress about a Trump Organization real estate project that was slated for Moscow, Russia and discussed through the fall of 2016 while the president was running for office.\nHe testified in a closed congressional interview that the project he pursued on Trump's behalf was abandoned by the time of the Iowa Caucuses in January 2016; that would be consistent with Trump's 'political messaging.'\nMueller later filed documents revealing Cohen said he discussed the proposal with Trump on multiple occasions and with members of the president's family, later in the year \u2013 even after Trump became the Republican nominee for president.\nCohen said he lied out of loyalty to Trump.\nCohen also played a role in hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels (left) and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal (right)\n'I made these misstatements to be consistent with Individual 1's political messaging and out of loyalty to Individual 1,' Cohen said at his plea hearing late last year.\n'Individual 1' is Mueller's name for Trump in the investigation.\nCohen was also the central figure in a plot to buy the silence of pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed that she had an affair with Trump in 2006.\nDaniels signed a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for $130,000 from Cohen, a transaction that he admitted was a violation of campaign finance laws since it amounted to an illegally large contribution benefiting Trump's White House hopes.\nHe said in court that Trump directed him to make the payment, suggesting the president was guilty of a crime.\nIn August he pleaded guilty to eight separate charges related to tax dodges, falsifying bank documents and the campaign finance violations involving Daniels and another woman, former Playboy magazine model Karen McDougal.\nCohen claims that at Trump's request, he arranged for the publisher of The National Enquirer to pay McDougal \u2013 another self-described past Trump paramour \u2013 for the exclusive rights to her life story. The magazine never published anything, engaging in a practice known as 'catch and kill' in order to help Trump avoid new scandals in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.\nTrump has denied ever having a sexual relationship with either Daniels or McDougal.\nMueller's final tally: Trump's inner circle of convicts and turncoats - and 25 wanted Russian trolls\nGUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN\nPleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence\nFlynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.\nHe admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.\nGUILTY AND JAILED: MICHAEL COHEN\nPleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018\nCohen was investigated by Mueller but the case was handed off to the Southern District of New York,leaving Manhattan's ferocious and fiercely independent federal prosecutors to run his case.\nCohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.\nHe also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.\nAnd he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.\nGUILTY AND JAILED: PAUL MANAFORT\nFound guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Sentenced to 47 months in March 2019. Pleaded guilty to two further charges - witness tampering and conspiracy against the United States. Jailed for total of seven and a half years in two separate sentences. Additionally indicted for mortgage fraud by Manhattan District Attorney, using evidence previously presented by Mueller\nManafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.\nManafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts in August 2018. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent due in September did not happen when he pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and witness tampering in a plea bargain. He was supposed to co-operate with Mueller but failed to.\nMinutes after his second sentencing hearing in March 2019, he was indicted on 16 counts of fraud and conspiracy by the Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., using evidence which included documents previously presented at his first federal trial. The president has no pardon power over charges by district and state attorneys.\nGUILTY AND GOING TO WEEKEND JAIL: RICK GATES\nPleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Sentenced to 45 days weekend jail and three years probation, December 17, 2018\nGates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.\nGUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS\nPleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018\nPapadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.\nGUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO\nPleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison\nPinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.\nGUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN\nPleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence and was deported to the Netherlands on his release\nVan der Zwaan was a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.\nHe admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik. His law firm say he was fired.\nGUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN\nPleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Sentenced to three years probation April 2019\nPatten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.\nHe arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.\nNeither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.\nCHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK\nIndicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia\nKilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.\nHe has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.\nINDICTED: THE RUSSIANS\nTwenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia\nTwo of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.\nVladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.\nINDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS\nBijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally.\nKian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.\nKian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.\nErdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.\nThe indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election.\nGUILTY AND AWAITING SENTENCE: ROGER STONE\nRoger Stone, a former Trump campaign official and longtime informal advisor to Trump, was indited on seven counts including obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and lying to Congress about his communications with WikiLeaks in January 2019. Convicted on all counts November 15, 2019, awaiting sentence\nStone was a person of interest to Mueller's investigators long before his January indictment, thanks in part due to his public pronouncements as well as internal emails about his contacts with WikiLeks.\nIn campaign texts and emails, many of which had already been publicly revealed before showing up in Mueller's indictment, Stone communicated with associates about WikiLeaks following reports the organization had obtained a cache of Clinton-related emails.\nStone, a former Nixon campaign adviser who has the disgraced former president's face permanently tattooed on his back, has long been portrayed as a central figure in the election interference scandal.\n'They got nothing,' he said of the special counsel's investigation.\nStone gave 'false and misleading' testimony about his requests for information from WikiLeaks. He then pressured a witness, comedian Randy Credico, to take the Fifth Amendment rather than testify, and pressured him in a series of emails. Following a prolonged dispute over testimony, he called him a 'rat' and threatened to 'take that dog away from you', in reference to Credico's pet, Bianca. Stone warned him: 'Let's get it on. Prepare to die.'\nCLEARED: GREG CRAIG\nGreg Craig, President Barack Obama's White House counsel, was indicted for failing to register as a foreign agent. Mueller's investigators uncovered Craig's work on behalf the government of Ukraine while probing Manafort, who did business with Craig.\nProsecutors released a grand jury indictment of Craig in April 2019, after Craig's law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP agreed to pay more than $4.6 million as part of a settlement. The prominent firm also acknowledged it had failed to register, and placed much of the blame on Craig, a senior partner there.\nCraig's lawyer blasted the decision as an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, and prepared to argue that omission of information during an interview is not tantamount to making false statements.\nThe charges stem from a 2012 report Craig and the firm produced on behalf of the Ukrainian government on opposition figure and former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko. She was an opponent of Manafort's client , former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.\nCraig was cleared on September 9 2019.",

The next day he is alleged to have threatened the officer.\nThe charge claims that the 30-year-old used 'threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause [the police officer] to believe that immediate unlawful violence would be used against him', or 'to provoke the immediate use of unlawful violence by him whereby that person was likely to believe that such violence would be used, or it was likely that such violence would be provoked'.\nThe couple touched down in the UK last night after a relaxing break in Koh Samui.\nPrice uploaded several pictures of them smiling together on social media.\nThe mother-of-five was cleared of drink-driving but convicted of the lesser charge of being drunk in charge of a vehicle.\nThe case against Boyson, who was released on bail, continues.\nThe 30-year-old personal trainer is pictured wearing a smart blazer, Gucci belt and black trousers outside court in Kent today",

where Harry has visited several times through his work with the Invictus Games</p>\n<p>New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect held a gun licence which enabled him to legally obtain semi-automatic weapons. She said the country's gun laws would change in the wake of the attack.</p>\n<p>Of those killed in the massacre, 42 died at the Masjid Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch, seven were killed at the suburban Linwood Masjid Mosque, and one person died at Christchurch Hospital.</p>\n<h3>What is the hongi and why is the traditional Maori greeting so sacred to the people of New Zealand?</h3>\n<p>The hongi is the traditional Maori greeting that sees two people welcome each other by rubbing or touching noses.</p>\n<p>It is a New Zealand tradition that comes from the Maori legend on how women were created.</p>\n<p>The hongi is an important part of New Zealand's culture and those who are offered the greeting should always accept, because of its significance.</p>\n<p>If a New Zealander should perform the hongi would you, it means that you are to be 'unified' with the person and that you are now more than a guest.</p>\n<p>Hongi roughly translates to 'sharing of the breath' and when you complete it as a guest, you are given a sense of responsibility for the island.</p>\n<p>To display this, you may be given some tasks to complete to show your loyalty and appreciation.</p>\n<p>In the past, you may have had to fight on the island's behalf but in modern times you must complete personal tasks such as no trace on the island and respecting its natural beauty.</p>\n<p>In the video live-streamed by Tarrant, a man inside a mosque appears to say 'Welcome brother' as a gunman approaches.</p>\n<p>A number of improvised explosive devices found on a vehicle after the shootings were defused by police.</p>\n<p>Mr Bush, who had earlier called the attack a 'very well-planned event', said the suspect was not known to police either in New Zealand or Australia. British security sources said there were no apparent UK links to the attack.</p>\n<p>Facebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack worldwide in the 24 hours after the shootings, 1.2 million of which were blocked at upload.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, it said no-one had reported the video while it was being streamed live, with the first report coming 29 minutes after the broadcast began and 12 minutes after it had ended.</p>\n<p>Chris Sonderby, vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said the video was viewed fewer than 200 times during the live broadcast.</p>\n<p>He said the company was 'working around the clock' to stop the video being posted on its site.</p>\n<p>Ms Ardern has said authorities hope to release all the bodies by Wednesday and police said authorities were working with pathologists and coroners to complete the task as soon as they can.</p>\n<p>As the nation continues to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy, Ms Ardern vowed action would be taken to ensure such an atrocity could never happen again.</p>\n<p>On Monday, New Zealand's Cabinet made 'in principle' decisions about gun law reform, with further details to be announced by next Monday.</p>\n<p>An inquiry into the events leading up to the attacks will also take place.</p>\n<p>'There is anger that this happened here,' she said.

Police said further charges were expected to follow.\nMeghan holds on to her belly as she wait to sign a book of condolence for victims of the New Zealand terror attack\nThe couple were greeted with a Hongi by High Commissioner Sir Jerry Mateparae and Deputy High Commissioner David Evans, having been asked represent the royal family because they are the most recent royal visitors to New Zealand\nBoth dressed solemnly in black, they were greeted with a traditional Hongi nose rub by the High Commissioner of New Zealand Jerry Mateparae, before laying flowers at a memorial\nMeghan, seen clutching a bouquet, and her husband Harry (right, sharing a traditional 'Maori kiss') have paid an emotional tribute to the victims of the Christchurch terror attack today as they signed a book of condolence on behalf of the Royal Family\nMeghan is greeted with a traditional Hongi nose rub by the High Commissioner of New Zealand Jerry Mateparae as she and Harry arrive at New Zealand House\nThe couple were invited to personally represent the royal family as they were the previous members to do so, having toured the country last year\nMeghan was dressed in a long black coat and a matching skirt, along with a clutch bag and plain high heeled shoes, as she arrived in central London today\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Duke and Duchess released a joint statement with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, condemning the massacre\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex hold hands as they make their way inside New Zealand House, where Harry has visited several times through his work with the Invictus Games\nNew Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the suspect held a gun licence which enabled him to legally obtain semi-automatic weapons. She said the country's gun laws would change in the wake of the attack.\nOf those killed in the massacre, 42 died at the Masjid Al Noor mosque in central Christchurch, seven were killed at the suburban Linwood Masjid Mosque, and one person died at Christchurch Hospital.\nWhat is the hongi and why is the traditional Maori greeting so sacred to the people of New Zealand?\nThe hongi is the traditional Maori greeting that sees two people welcome each other by rubbing or touching noses.\nIt is a New Zealand tradition that comes from the Maori legend on how women were created.\nThe hongi is an important part of New Zealand's culture and those who are offered the greeting should always accept, because of its significance.\nIf a New Zealander should perform the hongi would you, it means that you are to be 'unified' with the person and that you are now more than a guest.\nHongi roughly translates to 'sharing of the breath' and when you complete it as a guest, you are given a sense of responsibility for the island.\nTo display this, you may be given some tasks to complete to show your loyalty and appreciation.\nIn the past, you may have had to fight on the island's behalf but in modern times you must complete personal tasks such as no trace on the island and respecting its natural beauty.\nIn the video live-streamed by Tarrant, a man inside a mosque appears to say 'Welcome brother' as a gunman approaches.\nA number of improvised explosive devices found on a vehicle after the shootings were defused by police.\nMr Bush, who had earlier called the attack a 'very well-planned event', said the suspect was not known to police either in New Zealand or Australia. British security sources said there were no apparent UK links to the attack.\nFacebook said it had removed 1.5 million videos of the attack worldwide in the 24 hours after the shootings, 1.2 million of which were blocked at upload.\nOn Tuesday, it said no-one had reported the video while it was being streamed live, with the first report coming 29 minutes after the broadcast began and 12 minutes after it had ended.\nChris Sonderby, vice president and deputy general counsel at Facebook, said the video was viewed fewer than 200 times during the live broadcast.\nHe said the company was 'working around the clock' to stop the video being posted on its site.\nMs Ardern has said authorities hope to release all the bodies by Wednesday and police said authorities were working with pathologists and coroners to complete the task as soon as they can.\nAs the nation continues to come to terms with the scale of the tragedy, Ms Ardern vowed action would be taken to ensure such an atrocity could never happen again.\nOn Monday, New Zealand's Cabinet made 'in principle' decisions about gun law reform, with further details to be announced by next Monday.\nAn inquiry into the events leading up to the attacks will also take place.\n'There is anger that this happened here,' she said. 'There are many questions that need to be answered. The assurance that I give you is that they will be.'\nNew Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush previously said police were confident one person was responsible for the shootings.\n'That doesn't mean there weren't possibly people in support and that is to form an important part of our investigation,' he added.\nThe Duchess of Sussex meets with New Zealand's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Jerry Mateparae (shown right)\nA solemn-looking Meghan (shown placing a hand on her bump) was dressed in all black as she arrived at New Zealand House in London to pay her respects to the victims of the terror attack\nMeghan shakes hands with New Zealand's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom as her an Harry arrive at New Zealand House to pay their respects\nThe Duchess laid a bouquet of flowers among other tokens of support and respect to those who lost their lives in the Christchurch terror shooting\nMeghan looks solemn as she makes her way inside the building to sign a book of condolence, set up in tribute to the 50 people killed in Friday's attack\nThe Duke of Sussex receives a hongi from the High Commissioner of New Zealand Jerry Mateparae\nThe Duke and Duchess put on brave faces as they attended New Zealand House to pay their respects for the Christchurch terror attack\nPrince Harry and Meghan joined hoards of others to pay their respect to the victims of the New Zealand terror attack at New Zealand House today\nMeghan looked sombre as her and Harry visited New Zealand House today to pay their respects to those who lost their lives\nMeghan wrote a message of solidarity in a book of condolence. The message read: 'Our deepest condolences. We are with you'. Meghan finished the signed note with the Maori word 'aroha nui', that translates to 'with deep affection'\nMeghan joined Harry at New Zealand House today so the pair could pay their respects to those who lost their lives in the mass shootings at mosques in New Zealand. Meghan's appearance today came more than a week after her last official public engagement before the arrival of her baby\nThe duchess is believed to be around six weeks away from the arrival of her first child, which she has said is due in late April or early May.\nMeghan and Harry's baby will be seventh in line to the throne and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's eighth great-grandchild.\nKensington Palace announced the pregnancy on the eve of the couple's first royal tour, which ended in New Zealand.\nThe duchess made a big impression on the country's people and was singled out for praise by figures including Ms Ardern.\nShe said Meghan's pregnancy 'increased my respect for the role that she's playing at such an often tiring time', adding: 'I have real empathy and I think she's incredible.'\nThe duchess in turn praised the efforts of Kiwi women who fought for the right to vote 125 years ago, saying they were 'universally admired'.\nIn the wake of last week's terror attack, the Queen led heartfelt messages of condolence from senior royals to the people of New Zealand.\nIn a joint message, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said: 'We have all been fortunate to spend time in Christchurch and have felt the warm, open-hearted and generous spirit that is core to its remarkable people.\n'No person should ever have to fear attending a sacred place of worship.'",

                "text": "Three murderers had their convictions quashed sparking a costly retrial after a police officer failed to disclose her son's girlfriend was on the jury.\nDwayne Edgar, 31, Jake Whelan, 26, and Robert Lainsbury, 25, were convicted in December 2016 of the 'cold-blooded' killing of 29-year-old Lynford Brewster in Cardiff earlier that year - and sentenced to life in prison.\nBut all three had their convictions quashed after the relationship between the detective and juror was later discovered.\nDetective Constable Rebecca Bryant - a family liaison officer in the case - did not declare that her son's girlfriend Lauren Jones was sitting on the jury at trial.\nHer omission cost the taxpayer at least \u00a380,000 - because a retrial into the killers was ordered by the Court of Appeal.\nA damning judgement was kept hidden by reporting restrictions, but can now be revealed after the three killers were convicted for a second time after a seven-week trial at Bristol Crown Court which ended this week.\nJudges said experienced police officer DC Bryant and nursery teaching assistant Ms Jones 'connived' together in a 'shocking state of affairs'.\nThey added that it was 'crystal clear that this juror should never have sat on this trial' and as such the safety of the convictions 'is totally undermined'.\n'The folly of the juror and the police officer have wasted vast amounts of time and cost the public a great deal of money,' judges said.\n'Moreover, the agony for the victim's family is inevitably prolonged. We very much regret that fact.'\nThe killers will be sentenced later this month for the murder of Mr Brewster in Cardiff in June 2016.\nFather-of-three Mr Brewster was stabbed to death with a hunting knife in 'callous, cold-blooded' killing in broad daylight during a row with drugs dealer Whelan.\nDet Con Bryant, 46, had sent text messages to juror Lauren Jones to keep quiet about knowing each other ahead of the trial.\nOne text read: 'Don't tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I've told u about it although u know I haven't xxx..'\nDwayne Edgar, left, and Jake Whelan, right, were convicted of murdering Lynford Brewster, but had their conviction quashed after the secret came to light\nBryant sat with Mr Brewster's family in the courtroom as Miss Jones was just yards away on the jury bench at Cardiff Crown Court.\nA Court of Appeal judgement said: 'Several weeks after the trial an appellant's solicitor received information that a police officer providing family liaison, Detective Constable Bryant, who had attended court during the trial to provide support to the deceased's family, had a close relationship with a member of the jury.\n'That officer's son was in a long-term relationship with the juror.\n'There was recovered from the officer's phone a series of texts which the pair had exchanged at that time which are highly material in this appeal.\n'It is clear that the officer initially lied about having any relationship with Ms Jones, although she subsequently admitted contacts with her in interview.'\nThe Court of Appeal quashed the convictions and Edgar, Whelan and Lainsbury were ordered to have a retrial.\nThe texts from Bryant were uncovered after an investigation was launched by the CPS.\nThe messages from the South Wales Police detective read: 'The Murder trial is put back til 1st. Not that that matters cos they'll hold u til then if they need to.\n'Remember what I sed though, as long as you don't know any of the witnesses that's fine.... I won't be there hardly and I'm not a witness anyway so that ok u don't need to worry bout that.\n'Don't tell any of them who u r to me tho in case they think I've told u about it although u know I haven't xxx.'\nOne message also offered Miss Jones a lift from court: 'If ur on the murder ul be finished same time as me most days u can have a lift to mine afterwards if u wanted x.'\nJones replied, saying: 'Fab thanks! The bus is a nightmare x.'\nThe probe found Miss Jones also worked with victim Mr Brewster's sister.\nThe judgement said: 'She said nothing about her connection to the sister of the deceased. At one point she did say something to the effect that she was a teacher at the school but went no further than that. She appears to have followed the advice given in the first text mentioned.\n'The police officer also failed to say anything to anybody although she was aware that the juror was sitting on the murder trial.'\nSouth Wales Police said Detective Constable Bryant had not committed any criminal offences but she would be investigated by the force's internal disciplinary body.\nAssistant Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said: 'When issues regarding the original trial came to light, the matter was voluntarily referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and has been investigated by the South Wales Police Professional Standards Department.\n'Our investigation, which has also been subject of independent review, has not found any evidence that the officer intended to undermine the criminal justice process, and following a formal submission to the Crown Prosecution Service the matter will now be dealt with through South Wales Police disciplinary processes.\n'Our thoughts remain with the family of Mr Brewster who we have continued to support throughout this difficult time.'",

                "text": "Cindy McCain revealed on Tuesday a horrific message sent to her about her late husband and daughter Meghan as President Donald Trump slammed John McCain yet again, this time saying in the Oval Office 'I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be.'\nThe late senator's widow posted a screen shot from Facebook messenger on her Twitter feed with a note: 'I want to make sure all of you could see how kind and loving a stranger can be. I\u2019m posting her note for her family and friends could see.'\nThe message from a user named Tiffany Nicole read: 'Your husband was a traitorous piece of warmongering s*** and I'm glad he's dead. Hope your Mrs. Piggy looking daughter chokes to death on the next burger she stuffs down her fat neck, too, c***.'\nHer post comes on the fourth day of attacks President Trump has launched against John McCain.\nMeghan McCain has rallied to her father's defense in a series of posts on Instagram and Twitter, along with an impassioned speech on ABC's 'The View.'\nOver the weekend the president launched a barrage of tweets against the late senator, which reporters asked him about in the Oval Office Tuesday during a state visit with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nTrump cited McCain's 2017 Senate vote that ended GOP efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act - former President Barack Obama' signature healthcare law - as the reason for his anger.\n'I'm very unhappy that he didn't repeal and replace Obamacare as you know. He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote, and he said thumbs down. And our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great healthcare,' Trump said Tuesday.\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Meghan McCain (@meghanmccain) on Mar 18, 2019 at 5:44pm PDT\nView this post on Instagram\nA post shared by Katrina Pierson (@katrinapierson) on Mar 18, 2019 at 7:07pm PDT\nHe added that Sen. McCain 'told us hours before that he was going to repeal and replace' before voting the opposite way.\n'Frankly, had we even known that I think we would have gotten the vote because we could have gotten somebody else. So I think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things. I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be,' he said.\nAs part of her defensive strategy, Meghan McCain posted on Instagram a photo that showed military honors under her father's name and a bunch of pacifiers under Trump's name.\nShe also retweeted a flood of supporters defending her father and the McCain family.\nShe retweeted a tweet from Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse that read: 'There\u2019s something deeply troubled in @realDonaldTrump constantly trying to belittle John McCain. Deep within, Trump must realize how far better a man John was and will always be.'\nShe also retweeted a tweet from Mark Salter, one of McCain's top aides in the Senate who co-wrote several of his books.\nSalter wrote: 'Ok you aren't a fan. One more in a long list of things you are not. Honest Brave Smart Tough Disciplined Kind Generous Patriotic A fan of John McCain Had you been a fan, the Senator would have wondered what he had done so wrong that he earned the approval of a man he despised.'\nAfter Meghan McCain's Instagram post, Trump campaign senior adviser Katrina Pierson fired back with a mocking one of her own, featuring the same image of military honor's under McCain's name but the presidential seal under Trump's.\nCindy McCain has also retweeted defenders of her late husband.\nThe back-and-forth between the two camps is now in its fourth day of battle.\nOn Monday, Meghan McCain slammed Trump for having a 'pathetic life' for spending his weekend tweeting criticism of her father.\n'He spends his weekend obsessing over great men, because he knows it, and I know it, and all of you know it, he will never be a great man,' McCain said on ABC's 'The View.'\n'My father was his kryptonite in life. He was his kryptonite in death,' she added.\nPresident Trump attacked the late Sen. John McCain twice this weekend on Twitter\nMcCain, who is a co-host of the ABC program, said when she saw the president's tweets she thought that 'your life is spent on your weekends not with your family, not with your friends, but obsessing, obsessing over great men you could never live up to.'\n'That tells you everything you need to know about his pathetic life right now,' she added. 'I genuinely feel bad for his family. I can't imagine having a father that does this on the weekends.'\nTrump attacked the late senator twice this past weekend on Twitter, focusing on McCain's ties to the infamous Steele dossier that contains the unverified allegations the Russians have blackmail material on the president.\n'So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) 'last in his class' (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!, the president wrote on Sunday.\nMcCain was actually fifth from the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy.\nOn Saturday, Trump said McCain leaking the 'dirty dossier' was 'dark stain' on his legacy.\n'Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier 'is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain,'' Trump wrote, attributing the quote to, Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.\nTrump continued, referring to John McCain's vote on the Republican attempt to repeal Obamacare: 'He had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!'\nMcCain's 'no' vote on the GOP effort to take down Obama's signature law stopped the effort in its tracks.\nThe president and McCain had a testy relationship when the senator was alive leading to McCain not inviting Trump to his funeral, where the former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush gave the eulogies.\nIn regards to Trump's allegations, there is no evidence that McCain shared the Steele dossier before the election.\nMeghan McCain poses with her father, Senator John McCain on The View in October 2017\nThe late senator did hand-deliver a copy of it to then-FBI Director James Comey in December of 2016, after the election, as McCain wrote in his book 'The Restless Wave.'\n'The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation's security should have done,' McCain wrote. 'I did what duty demanded I do.'\nMeghan McCain also slapped back at the president on Saturday, saying he will never be loved.\n'No one will ever love you the way they loved my father.... I wish I had been given more Saturday's with him. Maybe spend yours with your family instead of on twitter obsessing over mine?' she tweeted on Saturday.\nOn Sunday, Trump retweeted a tweet from a supporter who wrote that 'millions of Americans truly LOVE President Trump, not McCain.'\nJohn McCain died at the age of 81 after battling brain cancer. He made explicit his desire that President Trump not attend his funeral.\nHis beef with President Trump dates at least back to the 2016 presidential campaign, when Trump criticized him for being taken prisoner in Vietnam.\n'He's not a war hero,' Trump said in July 2015, sarcastically quipping: 'He's a war hero because he was captured.'\nThen, he added, 'I like people that weren't captured.'",

The people of Yemen desperately need humanitarian help, not more bombs.'\nCritics of the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen say the situation in the country is only getting worse.\nThe conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and spawned what the United Nations calls the world's most dire humanitarian crisis, with the country on the brink of famine.\nTuesday's veto was the second of Trump's presidency.\nJust last month he overrode a congressional resolution that aimed to reverse the national emergency he declared in order to obtain funding for wall at the Mexican border.",

                "text": "President Trump once again criticized Fox News on Tuesday over its town hall with Senator Bernie Sanders, this time claiming that the network did not allow his supporters into the audience.\n\u2018Many Trump Fans & Signs were outside of the Fox News Studio last night in the now thriving (Thank you President Trump) Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for the interview with Crazy Bernie Sanders.\n\u2018Big complaints about not being let in - stuffed with Bernie supporters.\n\u2018What's with Fox News?\u2019\nWhen reached by DailyMail.com on Tuesday, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to the fact that this was a ticketed event and had a diverse audience, including supporters of Trump, Sanders and independent voters.\nMartha MacCallum, the Fox News anchor who co-hosted the event along with network colleague Bret Baier, told The Morning Call on Monday that various local and political groups in the Bethlehem area were invited to attend.\nThe day after the event, The Morning Call quoted at least two Trump supporters who were in the audience.\n'Socialists can\u2019t come up with facts to back their theology,' said Janis Mikofsky of Allentown.\n'It results in misery.'\nMikofsky, who identifies as a conservative and a Trump supporter, says she attended the town hall.\nThe Rupert Murdoch-owned cable news channel hosted Sanders, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist who is running for the Democratic Party nomination for president, for a town hall on Monday.\nThe event was held at ArtQuest Center in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\nSanders\u2019 town hall meeting set record ratings for Fox News and now Democratic breakout star Pete Buttigieg is moving to hold one of his own.\nSanders' Monday night event was 'the most-watched town hall of the season' with 2.55 million viewers, Fox News said in a statement on Tuesday, citing early Nielsen Media Research reports.\nFox News's town hall beat CNN's February town hall with Sanders in total viewers, the network crowed.\nAnd Buttigieg, who shot to national acclaim after an appearance at a CNN town hall at South by Southwest in March, is looking to hold one on Fox.\nA campaign spokesperson told The Hill that talks are happening as 'reaching out to the Fox audience is something we intend to do.'\nTrump posted two more tweets about Sanders on Tuesday.\n\u2018Bernie Sanders and wife should pay the Pre-Trump Taxes on their almost $600,000 in income.\n\u2018He is always complaining about these big TAX CUTS, except when it benefits him.\n\u2018They made a fortune off of Trump, but so did everyone else - and that\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing!\u2019\nThe tweet about Sanders\u2019 income was a reference to the tax returns that the senator from Vermont released on Monday.\nThe 10 years of tax returns provided details of Sanders\u2019 growing status as a millionaire fueled by a sharp jump in income from book royalties since his losing 2016 White House run.\nSanders, a U.S. senator who routinely rails against the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d he says have rigged the system to protect their wealth and power, had an adjusted gross income of $561,293 in 2018, $1,131,925 in 2017 and $1,062,626 in 2016, the returns showed.\nHe augmented his Senate salary with book royalties in each of those years, particularly in 2016 and 2017 when he made more than $800,000 each year in royalties.\nSanders has published three books since the start of his first White House run, including bestsellers Our Revolution and Where We Go From Here.\nIn 2014, the year before he launched his first presidential campaign, Sanders had an adjusted gross income of $205,271.\nSanders had faced mounting pressure to release his taxes, with critics saying the democratic socialist\u2019s millionaire status undercut his populist economic message. He has made no apologies for his financial well-being.\n\u2018It comes from a book I wrote, pretty good book,\u2019 Sanders told the Fox News Channel town hall on Monday.\n\u2018If anyone thinks that I should apologize for writing a best-selling book, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going to do it.\u2019\nTrump followed up with another tweet about Sanders on Tuesday, writing: \u2018I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)!\n\u2018I look forward to facing whoever it may be.\n\u2018May God Rest Their Soul!\u2019\nSanders late Tuesday responded to Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\u2018Looks like President Trump is scared of our campaign,\u2019 the senator from Vermont tweeted.\n\u2018He should be.\u2019\nOn Monday, Trump slammed 'crazy Bernie' for touting universal healthcare and tax hikes during his town hall.\nTrump said the the audience and co-host Baier were humoring Sanders by being 'smiley and nice' during the event.\n'So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly, @BretBaier and the 'audience' was so smiley and nice. Very strange, and now we have @donnabrazile?' Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.\nThe president was referring to the evening's viral moment when the Independent senator from Vermont faced off with the hosts about who would pay for a universal healthcare system.\nThe rust-belt audience was surprisingly receptive to Sanders' socialist healthcare proposal.\n'Senator, this audience has a lot of Democrats in it. It has Republicans, independents, Democratic Socialists, conservatives. I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here, a show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance, right now?' Baier asked.\nMore than half the audience for Fox's town hall raised their hand in the impromptu poll.\n'OK. Of those, how many are willing to transition to what the senator says, a government-run system?' Baier asked, which was met with even more hands raising and cheers from the audience.\nSanders, who represents Vermont in the Senate, identifies as a Democratic Socialist and says healthcare is a human right and should be free.\nBaier's co-host, MacCallum, asked how Sanders where the money would come from for a government-run healthcare system.\nWHO ARE THE 11 DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020?\nMICHAEL BENNET\nAge on Inauguration Day 2021: 56\nEntered race: May 2, 2019\nCareer: Currently Colorado senator.

Not long after news of the scheme broke, critics rushed to point out that celebrity parents like <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/college-cheating-scandal-judge-shushes-aunt-becky-actress-lori-loughlin-in-court-sets-bail-at-dollar1m?via=desktop&social=Reddit\">Lori Loughlin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/felicity-huffman-woken-by-fbi-agents-with-guns-drawn-in-college-cheating-raid\">Felicity Huffman</a> didn&rsquo;t need to break the law to game the system.</p>\n<p>For the ultra-rich, big contributions might get their name on a science building and their offspring a spot at a top-tier school&mdash;an option California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently called &ldquo;legal bribery.&rdquo; Even the moderately wealthy can grease the admissions process with extensive SAT tutoring or, more problematically, college application essay editing.</p>\n<p>In the admissions process, there&rsquo;s a high premium on the personal statement, a 500-word essay submitted through the Common Application, about some foible or lesson, which aims to give readers a better sense of the student than, say, a standardized test score.

The essay editors, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity since many still work in their field, painted the portrait of an industry rife with ethical hazards, where the line between helping and cheating can become difficult to draw.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/to-keep-their-dubious-elite-status-top-colleges-limit-access-and-encourage-cheating\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_731,w_1300,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552702242/190316-greenwald-elite-colleges-hero_1_yjx6iu\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>The employees who spoke to The Daily Beast often worked for companies with similar approaches to essay writing. For most, tutors would Skype with students early on in the application process to brainstorm ideas. (&ldquo;I would say there were a lot of instances of hammering kids with potential ideas,&rdquo; one tutor said. &ldquo;Like, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a terrible idea for an essay, why don&rsquo;t you try this instead?&rsquo;&rdquo;) Then, the student would write a draft, and bounce back edits with their tutor, who would grade it according to a standardized rubric, which included categories like spelling, sentence structure, style, or whether it was &ldquo;bullshit-free.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Most made between $30 and $100 per hour, or around $1,000 for helping a student through the entire application process, at times working on as many as 18 essays at a time for various schools. Two tutors who worked for the same company said they got a bonus if clients were accepted at their target universities.</p>\n<p>One consultant, a 22-year-old Harvard graduate, told The Daily Beast that, during his senior year in college, he began working as an essay editor for a company that hires Ivy Leaguers to tutor applicants on a range of subjects. When he took the job in September 2017, the company was still young and fairly informal. Managers would send him essays via email, and the tutor would revise and return them, with anywhere between a 24-hour and two-week turnaround. But from the beginning, the consultant explained, his managers were &ldquo;pretty explicit&rdquo; that the job entailed less editing than rewriting.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s done, it needs to be good enough for the student to go to that school, whether that means lying, making things up on behalf of the student, or basically just changing anything such that it would be acceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When it&rsquo;s done, it needs to be good enough for the student to go to that school, whether that means lying, making things up on behalf of the student, or basically just changing anything such that it would be acceptable,&rdquo; he told The Daily Beast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve edited anywhere from 200 to 225 essays. So, probably like 150 students total. I would say about 50 percent were entirely rewritten.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In one particularly egregious instance, the tutor said, a student submitted an essay on hip-hop, which named his three or four favorite rappers, but lacked a clear narrative. The tutor said he rewrote the essay to tell the story of the student moving to America, struggling to connect with an American stepfamily, but eventually finding a connection through rap. &ldquo;I rewrote the essay such that it said... you know, he found that through his stepbrother he could connect through rap music and having a stepbrother teach him about rap music, and I talked about this loving-relation thing. I don&rsquo;t know if that was true. He just said he liked rap music.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Over time, the tutor said, his company shifted its work model. Instead of sending him random, anonymous essays, the managers began to assign him students to oversee during the entire college application cycle. &ldquo;They thought it looked better,&rdquo; the tutor said. &ldquo;So if I get some student, &lsquo;Abby Whatever,&rsquo; I would write all 18 of her essays so that it would look like it was all one voice. I had this past year 40 students in the fall, and I wrote all their essays for the Common App and everything else.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Not every consultant was as explicit about the editing world&rsquo;s moral ambiguities. One administrator emphasized that his company&rsquo;s policies were firmly anti-cheating. He conceded, however, that the rules were not always followed: &ldquo;Bottom line is: It takes more time for an employee to sit with a student and help them figure things out for themselves, than it does to just do it. We had problems in the past with people cutting corners. We&rsquo;ve also had problems in the past with students asking for corners to be cut.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Another consultant who worked for the same company and later became the assistant director of U.S. operations told The Daily Beast that while rewriting was not overtly encouraged, it was also not strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The precise terms were: I was getting paid a lump sum in exchange for helping this student with this Common App essay and supplement essays at a couple universities. I was given a rubric of qualities for the essay, and I was told that the essay had to score a certain point at that rubric,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was never clear that anything legal was in our way, we were just told to make essays&mdash;we were told and we told tutors&mdash;to make the essays meet a certain quality standard and, you know, we didn&rsquo;t ask too many questions about who wrote what.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many of the tutors told The Daily Beast that their clients were often international students, seeking advice on how to break into the American university system. Some of the foreign students, four of the eight tutors told The Daily Beast, ranged in their English ability and required significant rewriting. One consultant, a freelancer who stumbled into tutoring in the fall of 2017 after a classmate needed someone to take over his clients, recounted the story of a female applicant with little-to-no English skills.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Her parents had me come in and look at all her college essays. The shape they were brought to me in was essentially unreadable. I mean there were the bare workings of a narrative here&mdash;even the grasp on English is tenuous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that, you know, being able to read and write in English would be kind of a prerequisite for an American university. But these parents really don&rsquo;t care about that at all. They&rsquo;re going to pay whoever to make the essays look like whatever to get their kids into school.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The tutor continued to advise this client, doing &ldquo;numerous, numerous edits on this girl&rsquo;s essay&rdquo; until she was later accepted at Columbia University. But not long after she matriculated, the tutor said she reached back out to him for help with her English courses. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know how to write essays, and she&rsquo;s struggling in class,&rdquo; he told The Daily Beast. &ldquo;I do the help that I can, but I say to the parents, &lsquo;You know, you did not prepare her for this. You put her in this position&rsquo;... Because obviously, the skills necessary to be at Columbia&mdash;she doesn&rsquo;t have those skills.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Daily Beast reached out to numerous college planning and tutoring programs and the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, but none responded to requests to discuss their policies on editing versus rewriting.</p>\n<p>The American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers also declined comment, and top universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Brown did not respond or declined comment on how they guard against essays being written by counselors or tutors. Stanford said in a statement that they &ldquo;have no specific policy with regard to the essay portion of the application.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A spokesperson for Common Application, the not-for-profit organization that oversees most college essay submissions, wrote that all students must sign a waiver before submitting their application, affirming that it is completely their &ldquo;own work, factually true, and honestly presented.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the Operation Varsity Blues case, the cheating was stunningly brazen. One of the proctors, so-called &ldquo;test whiz&rdquo; Mark Riddell, a Harvard grad who allegedly took hundreds of thousands in bribes, actually bubbled in kids&rsquo; answers on standardized test sheets, according to prosecutors. But the world of college essay editing is more subtle.</p>\n<p>Every good piece of writing needs an editor&mdash;someone to point out redundancy, confusing sentences, cliches, or even just where things get boring&mdash;and two of the tutors who spoke to The Daily Beast said that was the kind of editing that made up most of their work. &ldquo;Oftentimes, the job is as simple as &lsquo;what do you mean by this?&rsquo; or &lsquo;be more specific&rsquo;&rdquo; one tutor said. But, for others, it wasn&rsquo;t always clear where editing became cheating, or just how many revisions they could make before they were, in their own way, just bubbling in the answers.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re working on a piece of writing, there&rsquo;s not really a motive to it, other than to like it, and to get other people to like it. But with this, there&rsquo;s an agenda,&rdquo; one of the more cynical tutors explained. &ldquo;And the agenda is <em>me</em>&mdash;getting me into this school. I think that kind of changes the extent of what people want out of an editor... I think these kids and their parents really just want you to do whatever it takes to make this a get-into-college-free card.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Last week, the sting operation dubbed Operation Varsity Blues exposed a long list of well-heeled and well-known parents who rigged the college-admissions process, in part by paying proctors and ringers to take or correct tests for their kids. Not long after news of the scheme broke, critics rushed to point out that celebrity parents like Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman didn\u2019t need to break the law to game the system.\nFor the ultra-rich, big contributions might get their name on a science building and their offspring a spot at a top-tier school\u2014an option California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently called \u201clegal bribery.\u201d Even the moderately wealthy can grease the admissions process with extensive SAT tutoring or, more problematically, college application essay editing.\nIn the admissions process, there\u2019s a high premium on the personal statement, a 500-word essay submitted through the Common Application, about some foible or lesson, which aims to give readers a better sense of the student than, say, a standardized test score. More than one university and advising blog rank the essay among the \u201cmost important\u201d aspects of the process; one consultant writing in The New York Times described it as \u201cthe purest part of the application.\u201d\nBut while test scores are completed by the student alone\u2014barring bribed proctors, that is\u2014any number of people can alter an essay before submission, opening it up to exploitation and less-than-pure tactics at the hands of helicopter parents or expensive college-prep counselors who cater to the 1 percent.\nIn interviews with The Daily Beast, eight college application tutors shed light on the economy of editing, altering, and, at times, outright rewriting personal statements. The essay editors, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity since many still work in their field, painted the portrait of an industry rife with ethical hazards, where the line between helping and cheating can become difficult to draw.\nThe employees who spoke to The Daily Beast often worked for companies with similar approaches to essay writing. For most, tutors would Skype with students early on in the application process to brainstorm ideas. (\u201cI would say there were a lot of instances of hammering kids with potential ideas,\u201d one tutor said. \u201cLike, \u2018That\u2019s a terrible idea for an essay, why don\u2019t you try this instead?\u2019\u201d) Then, the student would write a draft, and bounce back edits with their tutor, who would grade it according to a standardized rubric, which included categories like spelling, sentence structure, style, or whether it was \u201cbullshit-free.\u201d\nMost made between $30 and $100 per hour, or around $1,000 for helping a student through the entire application process, at times working on as many as 18 essays at a time for various schools. Two tutors who worked for the same company said they got a bonus if clients were accepted at their target universities.\nOne consultant, a 22-year-old Harvard graduate, told The Daily Beast that, during his senior year in college, he began working as an essay editor for a company that hires Ivy Leaguers to tutor applicants on a range of subjects. When he took the job in September 2017, the company was still young and fairly informal. Managers would send him essays via email, and the tutor would revise and return them, with anywhere between a 24-hour and two-week turnaround. But from the beginning, the consultant explained, his managers were \u201cpretty explicit\u201d that the job entailed less editing than rewriting.\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s done, it needs to be good enough for the student to go to that school, whether that means lying, making things up on behalf of the student, or basically just changing anything such that it would be acceptable.\u201d\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s done, it needs to be good enough for the student to go to that school, whether that means lying, making things up on behalf of the student, or basically just changing anything such that it would be acceptable,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve edited anywhere from 200 to 225 essays. So, probably like 150 students total. I would say about 50 percent were entirely rewritten.\u201d\nIn one particularly egregious instance, the tutor said, a student submitted an essay on hip-hop, which named his three or four favorite rappers, but lacked a clear narrative. The tutor said he rewrote the essay to tell the story of the student moving to America, struggling to connect with an American stepfamily, but eventually finding a connection through rap. \u201cI rewrote the essay such that it said... you know, he found that through his stepbrother he could connect through rap music and having a stepbrother teach him about rap music, and I talked about this loving-relation thing. I don\u2019t know if that was true. He just said he liked rap music.\u201d\nOver time, the tutor said, his company shifted its work model. Instead of sending him random, anonymous essays, the managers began to assign him students to oversee during the entire college application cycle. \u201cThey thought it looked better,\u201d the tutor said. \u201cSo if I get some student, \u2018Abby Whatever,\u2019 I would write all 18 of her essays so that it would look like it was all one voice. I had this past year 40 students in the fall, and I wrote all their essays for the Common App and everything else.\u201d\nNot every consultant was as explicit about the editing world\u2019s moral ambiguities. One administrator emphasized that his company\u2019s policies were firmly anti-cheating. He conceded, however, that the rules were not always followed: \u201cBottom line is: It takes more time for an employee to sit with a student and help them figure things out for themselves, than it does to just do it. We had problems in the past with people cutting corners. We\u2019ve also had problems in the past with students asking for corners to be cut.\u201d\nAnother consultant who worked for the same company and later became the assistant director of U.S. operations told The Daily Beast that while rewriting was not overtly encouraged, it was also not strictly prohibited.\n\u201cThe precise terms were: I was getting paid a lump sum in exchange for helping this student with this Common App essay and supplement essays at a couple universities. I was given a rubric of qualities for the essay, and I was told that the essay had to score a certain point at that rubric,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never clear that anything legal was in our way, we were just told to make essays\u2014we were told and we told tutors\u2014to make the essays meet a certain quality standard and, you know, we didn\u2019t ask too many questions about who wrote what.\u201d\nMany of the tutors told The Daily Beast that their clients were often international students, seeking advice on how to break into the American university system. Some of the foreign students, four of the eight tutors told The Daily Beast, ranged in their English ability and required significant rewriting. One consultant, a freelancer who stumbled into tutoring in the fall of 2017 after a classmate needed someone to take over his clients, recounted the story of a female applicant with little-to-no English skills.\n\u201cHer parents had me come in and look at all her college essays. The shape they were brought to me in was essentially unreadable. I mean there were the bare workings of a narrative here\u2014even the grasp on English is tenuous,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that, you know, being able to read and write in English would be kind of a prerequisite for an American university. But these parents really don\u2019t care about that at all. They\u2019re going to pay whoever to make the essays look like whatever to get their kids into school.\u201d\nThe tutor continued to advise this client, doing \u201cnumerous, numerous edits on this girl\u2019s essay\u201d until she was later accepted at Columbia University. But not long after she matriculated, the tutor said she reached back out to him for help with her English courses. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know how to write essays, and she\u2019s struggling in class,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cI do the help that I can, but I say to the parents, \u2018You know, you did not prepare her for this. You put her in this position\u2019... Because obviously, the skills necessary to be at Columbia\u2014she doesn\u2019t have those skills.\u201d\nThe Daily Beast reached out to numerous college planning and tutoring programs and the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, but none responded to requests to discuss their policies on editing versus rewriting.\nThe American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers also declined comment, and top universities such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Brown did not respond or declined comment on how they guard against essays being written by counselors or tutors. Stanford said in a statement that they \u201chave no specific policy with regard to the essay portion of the application.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Common Application, the not-for-profit organization that oversees most college essay submissions, wrote that all students must sign a waiver before submitting their application, affirming that it is completely their \u201cown work, factually true, and honestly presented.\u201d\nIn the Operation Varsity Blues case, the cheating was stunningly brazen. One of the proctors, so-called \u201ctest whiz\u201d Mark Riddell, a Harvard grad who allegedly took hundreds of thousands in bribes, actually bubbled in kids\u2019 answers on standardized test sheets, according to prosecutors. But the world of college essay editing is more subtle.\nEvery good piece of writing needs an editor\u2014someone to point out redundancy, confusing sentences, cliches, or even just where things get boring\u2014and two of the tutors who spoke to The Daily Beast said that was the kind of editing that made up most of their work. \u201cOftentimes, the job is as simple as \u2018what do you mean by this?\u2019 or \u2018be more specific\u2019\u201d one tutor said. But, for others, it wasn\u2019t always clear where editing became cheating, or just how many revisions they could make before they were, in their own way, just bubbling in the answers.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working on a piece of writing, there\u2019s not really a motive to it, other than to like it, and to get other people to like it. But with this, there\u2019s an agenda,\u201d one of the more cynical tutors explained. \u201cAnd the agenda is me\u2014getting me into this school. I think that kind of changes the extent of what people want out of an editor... I think these kids and their parents really just want you to do whatever it takes to make this a get-into-college-free card.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders</a> (I-VT) had made overtures that he&rsquo;d operate more firmly within the Democratic Party as the party adopted procedural reforms to accommodate his concerns.</p>\n<p>The rapprochement was always delicate. And this week it hit a major snag as the senator&rsquo;s presidential campaign opened fire at one of the Democratic Party&rsquo;s leading think tanks over a video that its editorially independent news site posted on Sanders&rsquo; personal wealth.</p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/thinkprogress-a-powerful-media-arm-of-the-democratic-party-calls-out-bernie-sanders-for-his-wealth\">video from ThinkProgress</a> and the senator&rsquo;s response, in which he accused the Center for American Progress of bias against liberal candidates and veneration for corporate interests, exposed the lingering animus between the Sanders and the Democratic Party&rsquo;s actual institutions.</p>\n<p>It also raised alarm and questions as to whether Sanders was running to lead the party or to fundamentally change it.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-blasts-liberal-think-tank-cap-in-scathing-letter-this-counterproductive-negative-campaigning-needs-to-stop\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1434,w_2550,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1555260097/sanders_CAP_express_eo2hey\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>&ldquo;If you always want to be an aggrieved factional candidate, then you do what they did here,&rdquo; said a Democratic operative who is a fan of Sanders. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with the electoral context of Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina. Let&rsquo;s go fight that battle. Voters don&rsquo;t care about CAP.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The root of the latest blow up was a video produced by ThinkProgress noting that Sanders had stopped maligning millionaires&mdash;leaving his criticism for billionaires&mdash;when he became one himself. The news site is part of the CAP umbrella, which gave the video the veneer of a sanctioned attack. But it also claims editorial independence from the think tank, though the degree of that independence is difficult to define.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-team-flexes-confidence-as-primary-gets-more-crowded-we-are-building-this-campaign-to-win\">Sanders&rsquo; campaign</a> was initially uncertain of how it should respond to the post. But a day after it had been up&mdash;and shared gleefully by Republican operatives&mdash;they chose to push back in a way that, Democrats said, redefined disproportionality.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Sanders&rsquo; campaign sent a letter to the board of CAP and CAP Action Fund saying that the &ldquo;counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop.&rdquo; The letter referenced content written about Sanders and two close colleagues who are also in the 2020 race: <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-id-end-offshore-drilling-on-day-one-of-my-presidency\">Senators Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-MA) and <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cory-booker-hasnt-taken-off-yet-but-his-2020-presidential-campaign-doesnt-mind\">Cory Booker</a> (D-NJ). It also explicitly called out CAP president Neera Tanden, an ally of Hillary Clinton, who has been critical of Sanders in the past but has attempted to mend bridges.</p>\n<p>Among some Democrats, there was a sense of bewilderment that the Sanders campaign had gone&mdash;as one operative put it&mdash;&rdquo;nuclear&rdquo; over a mere web video. One Democratic consultant sympathetic to Sanders described the video as being &ldquo;like a gnat buzzing around your ear,&rdquo; one which should not have distracted from the candidate&rsquo;s Midwest tour.</p>\n<p>It also raised questions as to whether the senator was ready for the scrutiny that would come from being a frontrunning candidate, after having run as an insurgent against an ideal foil, Hillary Clinton, in 2016.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re leading in the polls of president of your party you should expect investigative stories to hit at least once a week and to be attacked by your opponents every day,&rdquo; said Ben Labolt, who served as press secretary to Barack Obama during the 2012 campaign. &ldquo;An attack on something like ThinkProgress is the sign of a super-narrow-minded campaign that isn&rsquo;t actually thinking of how the election will be won... They have chosen an establishment force that no one outside of the Starbucks at 16th and K would recognize.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But within Sanders&rsquo; orbit, the pushback was seen as strategically prudent. Sanders has often bristled at personal questions that he deems irrelevant to the set of beliefs he has espoused for decades. And his attack on CAP effectively set a benchmark for the type of coverage that the his team would countenance and reinforced his brand as someone outside of typical party structures. It also undermined any notion that he was a political pushover&mdash;a suggestion that lingered for some after he muted some of his attacks on Clinton in 2016.</p>\n<p>It didn&rsquo;t hurt matters that some prominent, though non-establishment, Democratic figures offered Sanders their support. <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-steyer-says-he-wont-run-in-2020-to-focus-on-impeaching-trump-instead\">Tom Steyer</a>, the liberal billionaire donor and party activist, who also serves on the board of directors for CAP issued a statement on his own saying he would use his &ldquo;voice on the Center for American Progress&rsquo; Board of Directors to discourage any such attacks on any candidate seeking the Democratic nomination in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Those close to Steyer told The Daily Beast that he released the statement without consulting with others at the organization and that it by no means suggested he was endorsing Sanders. Another CAP board member, Stacey Abrams, declined to comment. But a spokesperson for the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia directed The Daily Beast to a conciliatory statement Tanden issued on Monday afternoon, saying the video had been &ldquo;overly harsh&rdquo; and did &ldquo;not reflect our approach to a constructive debate of the issues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>That, for now, seems to have quieted the skirmish with Sanders&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-hires-top-civil-liberties-advocate-faiz-shakir-as-campaign-manager\">campaign manager Faiz Shakir</a> saying that the campaign looked &ldquo;forward to working in a more productive manner&rdquo; with CAP, &ldquo;if possible.&rdquo; But within a few hours, Sanders was, once more, putting pressure on the press; this time on an outlet of a highly-different ideological bent than ThinkProgress.</p>\n<p>In a town hall with Fox News, the senator hit back on the suggestion that his income-inequality message was muddied by his personal wealth by directly challenging the newscasters to ask the president for his own tax rates.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I pay the taxes that I owe,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and by the way, why don&rsquo;t you get Donald Trump up here and ask them how much he pays in taxes?&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "In seeking the 2020 nomination for the presidency, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) had made overtures that he\u2019d operate more firmly within the Democratic Party as the party adopted procedural reforms to accommodate his concerns.\nThe rapprochement was always delicate. And this week it hit a major snag as the senator\u2019s presidential campaign opened fire at one of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading think tanks over a video that its editorially independent news site posted on Sanders\u2019 personal wealth.\nThat video from ThinkProgress and the senator\u2019s response, in which he accused the Center for American Progress of bias against liberal candidates and veneration for corporate interests, exposed the lingering animus between the Sanders and the Democratic Party\u2019s actual institutions.\nIt also raised alarm and questions as to whether Sanders was running to lead the party or to fundamentally change it.\n\u201cIf you always want to be an aggrieved factional candidate, then you do what they did here,\u201d said a Democratic operative who is a fan of Sanders. \u201cIt has nothing to do with the electoral context of Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina. Let\u2019s go fight that battle. Voters don\u2019t care about CAP.\u201d\nThe root of the latest blow up was a video produced by ThinkProgress noting that Sanders had stopped maligning millionaires\u2014leaving his criticism for billionaires\u2014when he became one himself. The news site is part of the CAP umbrella, which gave the video the veneer of a sanctioned attack. But it also claims editorial independence from the think tank, though the degree of that independence is difficult to define.\nSanders\u2019 campaign was initially uncertain of how it should respond to the post. But a day after it had been up\u2014and shared gleefully by Republican operatives\u2014they chose to push back in a way that, Democrats said, redefined disproportionality.\nOver the weekend, Sanders\u2019 campaign sent a letter to the board of CAP and CAP Action Fund saying that the \u201ccounterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop.\u201d The letter referenced content written about Sanders and two close colleagues who are also in the 2020 race: Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). It also explicitly called out CAP president Neera Tanden, an ally of Hillary Clinton, who has been critical of Sanders in the past but has attempted to mend bridges.\nAmong some Democrats, there was a sense of bewilderment that the Sanders campaign had gone\u2014as one operative put it\u2014\u201dnuclear\u201d over a mere web video. One Democratic consultant sympathetic to Sanders described the video as being \u201clike a gnat buzzing around your ear,\u201d one which should not have distracted from the candidate\u2019s Midwest tour.\nIt also raised questions as to whether the senator was ready for the scrutiny that would come from being a frontrunning candidate, after having run as an insurgent against an ideal foil, Hillary Clinton, in 2016.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re leading in the polls of president of your party you should expect investigative stories to hit at least once a week and to be attacked by your opponents every day,\u201d said Ben Labolt, who served as press secretary to Barack Obama during the 2012 campaign. \u201cAn attack on something like ThinkProgress is the sign of a super-narrow-minded campaign that isn\u2019t actually thinking of how the election will be won... They have chosen an establishment force that no one outside of the Starbucks at 16th and K would recognize.\u201d\nBut within Sanders\u2019 orbit, the pushback was seen as strategically prudent. Sanders has often bristled at personal questions that he deems irrelevant to the set of beliefs he has espoused for decades. And his attack on CAP effectively set a benchmark for the type of coverage that the his team would countenance and reinforced his brand as someone outside of typical party structures. It also undermined any notion that he was a political pushover\u2014a suggestion that lingered for some after he muted some of his attacks on Clinton in 2016.\nIt didn\u2019t hurt matters that some prominent, though non-establishment, Democratic figures offered Sanders their support. Tom Steyer, the liberal billionaire donor and party activist, who also serves on the board of directors for CAP issued a statement on his own saying he would use his \u201cvoice on the Center for American Progress\u2019 Board of Directors to discourage any such attacks on any candidate seeking the Democratic nomination in the future.\u201d\nThose close to Steyer told The Daily Beast that he released the statement without consulting with others at the organization and that it by no means suggested he was endorsing Sanders. Another CAP board member, Stacey Abrams, declined to comment. But a spokesperson for the former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Georgia directed The Daily Beast to a conciliatory statement Tanden issued on Monday afternoon, saying the video had been \u201coverly harsh\u201d and did \u201cnot reflect our approach to a constructive debate of the issues.\u201d\nThat, for now, seems to have quieted the skirmish with Sanders\u2019 campaign manager Faiz Shakir saying that the campaign looked \u201cforward to working in a more productive manner\u201d with CAP, \u201cif possible.\u201d But within a few hours, Sanders was, once more, putting pressure on the press; this time on an outlet of a highly-different ideological bent than ThinkProgress.\nIn a town hall with Fox News, the senator hit back on the suggestion that his income-inequality message was muddied by his personal wealth by directly challenging the newscasters to ask the president for his own tax rates.\n\u201cI pay the taxes that I owe,\u201d he declared, \u201cand by the way, why don\u2019t you get Donald Trump up here and ask them how much he pays in taxes?\u201d",

                "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-VT) Monday evening Fox News town hall event was the most-watched town hall event of the 2020 campaign thus far, according to early Nielsen data. And at least four other Democratic candidates are open to participating in one of their own.\nAccording to early Nielsen data, more than 2.5 million viewers tuned in to hear Sanders, a self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d make his case on Fox News during the 6:30pm hour, prior to primetime. That total viewership bested CNN\u2019s Bernie Sanders town hall event from back in February; and it doubled MSNBC\u2019s during the same time period on Monday evening, and nearly tripled CNN\u2019s.\nThe prior town hall ratings record for the 2020 cycle was a CNN-hosted event with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), which drew 1.95 million total viewers.\nAdditionally, per Nielsen, Fox\u2019s Sanders event brought in 489,000 viewers between the ages of 25 and 54\u2014a key demographic for cable-news advertisers\u2014trouncing CNN\u2019s 281,000 tally and MSNBC\u2019s 208,000.\nThe event, which took place in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, saw the Vermont senator discuss a wide range of topics and occasionally spar with moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.\nThe Democratic National Committee banned the network from hosting one of its sanctioned debates, citing a New Yorker report on the network\u2019s close ties to President Trump. But the success of Sanders\u2019 town hall event\u2014both in terms of ratings and the headlines generated\u2014comes as at least four other presidential campaigns consider being involved in a similar event.\nFox News announced on Wednesday afternoon that it will hold a town hall with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in Milwaukee on May 8, with Baier and MacCallum once again hosting.\nSouth Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in talks to participate in a Fox News town hall, a campaign aide told The Daily Beast, and he had been prior to the airing of Sanders\u2019 event.\nMeanwhile, the campaign for Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)\u2014the latest entry into the crowded Democratic contest\u2014said \u201che\u2019s willing to do a Fox town hall, and we expect to start discussions with the network soon regarding a time and place.\u201d Discussions about doing so have not yet begun, according to the campaign but Swalwell had previously told The Daily Beast that he makes efforts to appear on the network.\nJulia Krieger, communications director for Rep. Tim Ryan\u2019s (D-OH) presidential campaign said that he is also \u201cwilling to do a town hall with Fox News,\u201d adding that \u201cthe campaign has reached out proactively to the network to express interest in this type of forum.\u201d She said that the network had also reached out to them.\nAnd Jennifer Fiore, a senior adviser to Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign, told The Daily Beast that they are in conversations with the network as well.\n\"He\u2019s been a red state mayor and has always campaigned hard for every single vote on both sides of the aisle and will do the same thing in his campaign for president of the United States because everybody counts,\" she said.\nThe network had previously said they hoped the DNC would reconsider its position on hosting a debate on Fox.\n\u201cWe hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate,\u201d said Bill Sammon, Fox News\u2019 senior vice president and D.C. managing editor. \u201cThey\u2019re the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America, which includes many persuadable voters.\u201d\nThis story was updated to add a statement from Julian Castro's campaign and the news of Klobuchar\u2019s scheduled town-hall event.",

But at the time of the raid last month he had a much more sensitive position: Pyongyang's envoy to the nuclear talks with Washington and Seoul.</p>\n<p>The group busted into the embassy just five days before the summit in Hanoi between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would have made any intelligence it picked up useful&mdash;but has also been cited by analysts as a reason it was not sanctioned by the Americans. The timing would seem to be too provocative and the risk of scuttling the summit too high.</p>\n<p>In any event, for a multitude of reasons anticipated long before the Madrid incident, the Hanoi summit was a failure.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-kim-trump-summit-crashes-in-hanoi\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1551349813/190227-trump-un-korea-tease_edhgub\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>Initial <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/03/13/inenglish/1552464196_279320.html\">reports in Spain</a> after the break-in did not mention Jayu Joseon (formerly named Cheollima Civil Defense), but did mention suspicions among unnamed Spanish authorities that two of the men who took part had unspecified connections to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p>\n<p>Subsequent reports <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-shadowy-group-trying-to-overthrow-kim-jong-un-raided-a-north-korean-embassy-in-broad-daylight/2019/03/15/ae4208a4-c451-4886-b608-f5ac1f182d3d_story.html?utm_term=.4c5b15a006a3\">in <em>The Washington Post</em></a> and elsewhere have suggested Jayu Joseon operates entirely on its own. But the very long record of exile/underground movements around the world suggests they almost always have at least some support from foreign powers, and may also receive direction from them.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671532987/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4\">Nicaragua&rsquo;s Contras</a>, built up by the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and Iran&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/giuliani-to-speak-beside-leader-of-accused-iranian-cult\">Mujahedin e Khalq</a>, backed by Iraq&rsquo;s Saddam Hussein until his downfall, would be two examples.)</p>\n<p>Yet another sign of the extreme sensitivity of the Madrid operation is that Spanish authorities have not released any information on their investigation aside from the basic facts that the 10 men entered the embassy, beat up and tied eight people inside, and remained there for several hours.</p>\n<p>Jayu Joseon has yet to comment on the Madrid raid. Indeed, it might not have been publicized at all had a police vehicle not shown up at the embassy after a woman freed herself and appeared at a window shouting for help.</p>\n<p>When a police officer knocked on the door, a man opened it up and said there was no problem. The police, respecting the embassy&rsquo;s diplomatic status, did not attempt to enter and see for themselves.</p>\n<p>Finally ,the 10 fled in two luxury vehicles that sped through the opened gates of the embassy drive. The cars veered crazily through traffic before they were abandoned and the men disappeared without a trace&mdash;at least as far as public information is concerned.</p>\n<p>Compounding the mystery is the fact that North Koreans are not commenting on an episode that had to have embarrassed them by revealing the weakness of their own security and the loss of potentially valuable information known only at the highest levels.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kim-jong-uns-hunger-games\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552367738/190311-kirk-kim-un-tease_uij8hw\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>Even when Spanish police first leaked word that two of the 10 had links to the CIA, it was evident Madrid authorities knew a lot more. Surely they would have searched and traced the vehicles to their owners, and they would have been expected to track down at least some of the 10 rather than let all escape so cleanly, in broad daylight, leaving no clues as to who they were or who was behind them.</p>\n<p>(In that respect, the operation is reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-cia-kidnapper-facing-jail-in-italy\">the sloppy CIA kidnapping of a jihadi off the street in Milan in February 2003</a>, which eventually exposed the cooperation of local intelligence services as well.)</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why many believe the CIA did that,&rdquo; said Kim Tae-woo. &ldquo;That explains the silence of the the Spanish government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jayu Joseon, or Cheollima, did not appear out of nowhere. It previously promoted Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s rather more mellow, fun-loving and quite talkative older half-brother, to overthrow and replace him.</p>\n<p>Kim Jong Nam was murdered in February 2017 when VX nerve agent, which is part of North Korea&rsquo;s chem-bio warfare arsenal, was smeared on his face at Kuala Lumpur&rsquo;s airport.</p>\n<p>After the murder, presumed to have been orchestrated by Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s agents, Jayu Joseon took credit for spiriting Kim Jong Nam&rsquo;s son, Kim Han Sol, along with his mother and sister, out of their home in Macao and taking them to a foreign country, widely thought to be Finland since Han Sol broadcast a sorrowful message on Finnish TV.</p>\n<p>The Madrid 10 are assumed to have transferred the computers and mobile phones to a foreign intelligence agency. An auction to the highest bidder would not be unprecedented in such matters, but most of the suspicion is focused on the CIA, which, if it could access the encrypted material in time, could have found information potentially useful for the Hanoi summit and afterward.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/police-kim-jong-nam-suspect-thought-it-was-a-tv-prank\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1491846345/cheats/2017/02/17/police-kim-jong-nam-suspect-thought-it-was-a-tv-prank/170217-north-korea-murder-prank-cheat_fjn4ss\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>&ldquo;They can see the North Korean strategy and goals,&rdquo; said Kim Tae-woo, former director of the Korea Institute of National Unification here.</p>\n<p>Money for that possible treasure trove of information would have been only one motive for the raid. Patriotism and power are the core incentives for the group, said to be spearheaded by defectors from North Korea and what appear to be foreigners with a stake in their activities.</p>\n<p>One strong sign of foreign involvement, says Kim Tae-woo, is that Korean-language statements on their website are written awkwardly, reflecting authorship by one whose Korean is less than perfect.</p>\n<p>Adding to the suspected CIA connection are reports that the late Kim Jong Nam, before he left his hotel in Kuala Lumpur for the airport, had been seen talking to an American. Then, after he was murdered by the two women who smeared the VX agent on his face, $124,000 in $100 bills reportedly was found in his bag, leading to speculation that he had been paid off for services to the Americans or to promote Jayu Joseon or both.</p>\n<p>Suspicions that Kim Jong Nam might have wanted to seize power no doubt spurred Kim Jong Un to want to get him out of the way.</p>\n<p>Two young women, one from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, actually smeared the poison on on Kim Jong Nam&rsquo;s face in the crowded airport, but four North Koreans were caught on camera watching the whole episode. They had convinced the women this was a harmless prank for which they paid them a small sum. The four, listed as wanted by Malaysian police, quickly checked onto flights out of the country.</p>\n<p>The Indonesian was freed by the court last week after prosecutors dropped the case against her, but the Vietnamese woman has been ordered to stand trial.</p>\n<p>Early the morning of the court hearings, someone spray-painted on the walls of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, in Korean Hangul script, &ldquo;Free North Korea&rdquo; (Jayu Joseon), and &ldquo;Down with Kim Jong Un.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;North Korea sends important messages to every embassy every month or so,&rdquo; said Ken Eom, who defected to South Korea 10 years ago. But Jayu Joseon is believed to have selected the North Korean embassy in Spain rather than the much larger North Korean embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, the center of North Korean operations in Europe, for two reasons. First, the installation in Madrid, without the ambassador there, was not so tightly guarded as other embassies. And, second, Kim Hyok Chol while he was there would have been privy to the highest level of messages.</p>\n<p>Whatever the planning, the raid exposes what is evidently the first sign of armed opposition by a North Korean dissident group against Kim Jong Un and his oppressive regime.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We can be 99.9 percent sure that Cheollima [Jayu Joseon] carried out the raid,&rdquo; says Lee Sung-yoon, professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. &ldquo;They had all the incentive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>As noted, Ambassador Kim Hyok Chol, after his expulsion, emerged as the North&rsquo;s chief negotiator in the very difficult pre-summit dialogue with the U.S. envoy on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, and some of the message traffic since his departure from Spain was presumed to concern those talks. The messages may have kept on coming for some time through the embassy in Spain even though he would see them elsewhere. Or at least that may have been the assumption of the Madrid 10.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-the-us-losing-south-korea-moon-jae-in-and-kim-jong-un-conspire-against-trump\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1537749054/180923-chang-trump-moon-kim-hero_gsdbrj\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>The organization appears to have gone quiet after the Kim Jong Nam incident two years ago, with the Madrid incident marking a spectacular comeback.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that South Korean President Moon Jae-in was elected in May 2017 and almost certainly would not tolerate covert action against North Korea by South Korea&rsquo;s National Intelligence Service (NIS).</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The NIS under Moon would definitely not be involved,&rdquo; said David Straub, former senior diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Seoul. &ldquo;The Moon administration&rsquo;s policy involves appeasement of Pyongyang; this action is the opposite of that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Many NIS operatives reportedly have been laid off under Moon, however, and just as retired South Korean military officers are often quite critical of what they see as the government&rsquo;s current soft line against North Korea, so out-of-work NIS people speak derisively of the trend to ignore or silence them.</p>\n<p>Malcontents have reason to criticize the government&rsquo;s policies. &ldquo;So many have been ousted, they&rsquo;re very upset,&rdquo; says Kim Tae-woo. But might a few want to consider supporting an armed movement against the North? &ldquo;Theoretically it&rsquo;s possible, but there is no evidence.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For the record, both the U.S. and South Korea officially profess complete ignorance of the whole affair beyond what they&rsquo;ve seen in the media. &ldquo;I have nothing to share at this time,&rdquo; said a U.S. embassy spokesman here. &ldquo;We have nothing to confirm,&rdquo; echoed a voice at the South Korean foreign ministry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jayu Joseon on its website, in correct English, gives the cruelty of the North Korean regime as the reason it cannot identify its members, much less where they are.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do not forget how merciless the regime is,&rdquo; says the message on the site. &ldquo;Identification of one person may reveal the identity of another member.&rdquo; The website says &ldquo;compatriots and relatives have lost their lives in the hands of the regime&rdquo; and those who are imprisoned &ldquo;will be put to death if it is revealed that they have dissenters in their families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Jayu Joseon &ldquo;established credibility by acting quickly and getting Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam, to safety within days of his father's gruesome assassination on Feb 13, 2017,&rdquo; said Lee Sung-yoon.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;An aura of mystery was created,&rdquo; said Lee. &ldquo;Mystique and aura create expectations of more dazzling feats to come. But for the next two years the group was silent. Then the raid on the DPRK Embassy in Madrid came just five days shy of the Trump-Kim Jong Un summit in Hanoi.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Lee is among those who believe the Cheollima organization, short of funds, may have hoped to use these CIA connections to unload all these computers and phones for a fat fee. &ldquo;Approaching the U.S. government with the assets retrieved in Madrid would possibly secure the group some protection and even support behind the scenes,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Lee questions, however, whether the CIA would have planned the operation, reasoning, &ldquo;For the CIA to commit such a brazen act&mdash;and almost get caught in the middle of it&mdash;and undermine Trump's leverage would have been tantamount to treason.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Analysts say Jayu Joseon is angling for support inside North Korea as well despite the obvious dangers of exposure and execution of anyone caught by Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s security apparatus. &ldquo;Senior defectors say these guys have to have contacts,&rdquo; said Kim Sung-bak, Hanyang University expert on North Korea. &ldquo;They try to establish themselves as the legal government.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Chances of success are not good. &ldquo;It's hard to imagine any opposition group outside North Korea having ties and support inside the DPRK,&rdquo; said a retired U.S. official who asked that his name not be used. &ldquo;The risks are just too high and the internal security in the North is just too tight and pervasive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Be that as it may, the shadowy figures behind the participants in the raid promise a long struggle.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Please do not forget the kind of ruthless regime we are up against,&rdquo; says a message on the website. &ldquo;They have no respect for international norms. The struggle we are engaged in with the incumbent regime is not a political race between equals, but a small revolutionary group, fighting and resisting a totalitarian regime that maintains concentration camps, keeps its people enslaved, and regularly kills its opponents and their families.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The inference was clear. They intend to be heard from again. The rescue of Kim Jong Nam&rsquo;s son and the raid in Madrid are not likely to be the end of the story. In Kuala Lumpur, the writing was on the wall.</p>\n<p><em>Itxu D&iacute;az in Madrid also contributed reporting to this story.</em></p>",

                "text": "SEOUL\u2014The 10 men in dark suits who raided the North Korean embassy in Madrid last month had one goal in mind, it would seem: to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un.\nAlthough the scene of the Feb. 22 crime in Spain was many thousands of miles from the DMZ, analysts view the 10 involved as the cutting edge of a North Korean dissident group that\u2019s now named Jayu Joseon, \u201cFree [North] Korea.\u201d It allegedly has the backing of some wealthy Koreans and foreigners as well as ties inside the North\u2014apparently the first organization to have set up an operational challenge to the leadership in Pyongyang.\nThe immediate purpose of the break-in was to seize computers and cellphones on which intelligence analysts could find top-secret message traffic to the former North Korean ambassador to Spain, Kim Hyok Chol.\nHe was expelled by Madrid in September 2017 after the United Nations imposed new sanctions on the North for its nuclear and missile tests. But at the time of the raid last month he had a much more sensitive position: Pyongyang's envoy to the nuclear talks with Washington and Seoul.\nThe group busted into the embassy just five days before the summit in Hanoi between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would have made any intelligence it picked up useful\u2014but has also been cited by analysts as a reason it was not sanctioned by the Americans. The timing would seem to be too provocative and the risk of scuttling the summit too high.\nIn any event, for a multitude of reasons anticipated long before the Madrid incident, the Hanoi summit was a failure.\nInitial reports in Spain after the break-in did not mention Jayu Joseon (formerly named Cheollima Civil Defense), but did mention suspicions among unnamed Spanish authorities that two of the men who took part had unspecified connections to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.\nSubsequent reports in The Washington Post and elsewhere have suggested Jayu Joseon operates entirely on its own. But the very long record of exile/underground movements around the world suggests they almost always have at least some support from foreign powers, and may also receive direction from them.\n(Nicaragua\u2019s Contras, built up by the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and Iran\u2019s Mujahedin e Khalq, backed by Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein until his downfall, would be two examples.)\nYet another sign of the extreme sensitivity of the Madrid operation is that Spanish authorities have not released any information on their investigation aside from the basic facts that the 10 men entered the embassy, beat up and tied eight people inside, and remained there for several hours.\nJayu Joseon has yet to comment on the Madrid raid. Indeed, it might not have been publicized at all had a police vehicle not shown up at the embassy after a woman freed herself and appeared at a window shouting for help.\nWhen a police officer knocked on the door, a man opened it up and said there was no problem. The police, respecting the embassy\u2019s diplomatic status, did not attempt to enter and see for themselves.\nFinally ,the 10 fled in two luxury vehicles that sped through the opened gates of the embassy drive. The cars veered crazily through traffic before they were abandoned and the men disappeared without a trace\u2014at least as far as public information is concerned.\nCompounding the mystery is the fact that North Koreans are not commenting on an episode that had to have embarrassed them by revealing the weakness of their own security and the loss of potentially valuable information known only at the highest levels.\nEven when Spanish police first leaked word that two of the 10 had links to the CIA, it was evident Madrid authorities knew a lot more. Surely they would have searched and traced the vehicles to their owners, and they would have been expected to track down at least some of the 10 rather than let all escape so cleanly, in broad daylight, leaving no clues as to who they were or who was behind them.\n(In that respect, the operation is reminiscent of the sloppy CIA kidnapping of a jihadi off the street in Milan in February 2003, which eventually exposed the cooperation of local intelligence services as well.)\n\u201cThat\u2019s why many believe the CIA did that,\u201d said Kim Tae-woo. \u201cThat explains the silence of the the Spanish government.\u201d\nJayu Joseon, or Cheollima, did not appear out of nowhere. It previously promoted Kim Jong Nam, Kim Jong Un\u2019s rather more mellow, fun-loving and quite talkative older half-brother, to overthrow and replace him.\nKim Jong Nam was murdered in February 2017 when VX nerve agent, which is part of North Korea\u2019s chem-bio warfare arsenal, was smeared on his face at Kuala Lumpur\u2019s airport.\nAfter the murder, presumed to have been orchestrated by Kim Jong Un\u2019s agents, Jayu Joseon took credit for spiriting Kim Jong Nam\u2019s son, Kim Han Sol, along with his mother and sister, out of their home in Macao and taking them to a foreign country, widely thought to be Finland since Han Sol broadcast a sorrowful message on Finnish TV.\nThe Madrid 10 are assumed to have transferred the computers and mobile phones to a foreign intelligence agency. An auction to the highest bidder would not be unprecedented in such matters, but most of the suspicion is focused on the CIA, which, if it could access the encrypted material in time, could have found information potentially useful for the Hanoi summit and afterward.\n\u201cThey can see the North Korean strategy and goals,\u201d said Kim Tae-woo, former director of the Korea Institute of National Unification here.\nMoney for that possible treasure trove of information would have been only one motive for the raid. Patriotism and power are the core incentives for the group, said to be spearheaded by defectors from North Korea and what appear to be foreigners with a stake in their activities.\nOne strong sign of foreign involvement, says Kim Tae-woo, is that Korean-language statements on their website are written awkwardly, reflecting authorship by one whose Korean is less than perfect.\nAdding to the suspected CIA connection are reports that the late Kim Jong Nam, before he left his hotel in Kuala Lumpur for the airport, had been seen talking to an American. Then, after he was murdered by the two women who smeared the VX agent on his face, $124,000 in $100 bills reportedly was found in his bag, leading to speculation that he had been paid off for services to the Americans or to promote Jayu Joseon or both.\nSuspicions that Kim Jong Nam might have wanted to seize power no doubt spurred Kim Jong Un to want to get him out of the way.\nTwo young women, one from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, actually smeared the poison on on Kim Jong Nam\u2019s face in the crowded airport, but four North Koreans were caught on camera watching the whole episode. They had convinced the women this was a harmless prank for which they paid them a small sum. The four, listed as wanted by Malaysian police, quickly checked onto flights out of the country.\nThe Indonesian was freed by the court last week after prosecutors dropped the case against her, but the Vietnamese woman has been ordered to stand trial.\nEarly the morning of the court hearings, someone spray-painted on the walls of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, in Korean Hangul script, \u201cFree North Korea\u201d (Jayu Joseon), and \u201cDown with Kim Jong Un.\u201d\n\u201cNorth Korea sends important messages to every embassy every month or so,\u201d said Ken Eom, who defected to South Korea 10 years ago. But Jayu Joseon is believed to have selected the North Korean embassy in Spain rather than the much larger North Korean embassy in Stockholm, Sweden, the center of North Korean operations in Europe, for two reasons. First, the installation in Madrid, without the ambassador there, was not so tightly guarded as other embassies. And, second, Kim Hyok Chol while he was there would have been privy to the highest level of messages.\nWhatever the planning, the raid exposes what is evidently the first sign of armed opposition by a North Korean dissident group against Kim Jong Un and his oppressive regime.\n\u201cWe can be 99.9 percent sure that Cheollima [Jayu Joseon] carried out the raid,\u201d says Lee Sung-yoon, professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. \u201cThey had all the incentive.\u201d\nAs noted, Ambassador Kim Hyok Chol, after his expulsion, emerged as the North\u2019s chief negotiator in the very difficult pre-summit dialogue with the U.S. envoy on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, and some of the message traffic since his departure from Spain was presumed to concern those talks. The messages may have kept on coming for some time through the embassy in Spain even though he would see them elsewhere. Or at least that may have been the assumption of the Madrid 10.\nThe organization appears to have gone quiet after the Kim Jong Nam incident two years ago, with the Madrid incident marking a spectacular comeback.\nIt should be noted that South Korean President Moon Jae-in was elected in May 2017 and almost certainly would not tolerate covert action against North Korea by South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service (NIS).\n\u201cThe NIS under Moon would definitely not be involved,\u201d said David Straub, former senior diplomat at the U.S. embassy in Seoul. \u201cThe Moon administration\u2019s policy involves appeasement of Pyongyang; this action is the opposite of that.\u201d\nMany NIS operatives reportedly have been laid off under Moon, however, and just as retired South Korean military officers are often quite critical of what they see as the government\u2019s current soft line against North Korea, so out-of-work NIS people speak derisively of the trend to ignore or silence them.\nMalcontents have reason to criticize the government\u2019s policies. \u201cSo many have been ousted, they\u2019re very upset,\u201d says Kim Tae-woo. But might a few want to consider supporting an armed movement against the North? \u201cTheoretically it\u2019s possible, but there is no evidence.\u201d\nFor the record, both the U.S. and South Korea officially profess complete ignorance of the whole affair beyond what they\u2019ve seen in the media. \u201cI have nothing to share at this time,\u201d said a U.S. embassy spokesman here. \u201cWe have nothing to confirm,\u201d echoed a voice at the South Korean foreign ministry.\u201d\nJayu Joseon on its website, in correct English, gives the cruelty of the North Korean regime as the reason it cannot identify its members, much less where they are.\n\u201cDo not forget how merciless the regime is,\u201d says the message on the site. \u201cIdentification of one person may reveal the identity of another member.\u201d The website says \u201ccompatriots and relatives have lost their lives in the hands of the regime\u201d and those who are imprisoned \u201cwill be put to death if it is revealed that they have dissenters in their families.\u201d\nJayu Joseon \u201cestablished credibility by acting quickly and getting Kim Han Sol, the son of Kim Jong Nam, to safety within days of his father's gruesome assassination on Feb 13, 2017,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon.\n\u201cAn aura of mystery was created,\u201d said Lee. \u201cMystique and aura create expectations of more dazzling feats to come. But for the next two years the group was silent. Then the raid on the DPRK Embassy in Madrid came just five days shy of the Trump-Kim Jong Un summit in Hanoi.\u201d\nLee is among those who believe the Cheollima organization, short of funds, may have hoped to use these CIA connections to unload all these computers and phones for a fat fee. \u201cApproaching the U.S. government with the assets retrieved in Madrid would possibly secure the group some protection and even support behind the scenes,\u201d he said.\nLee questions, however, whether the CIA would have planned the operation, reasoning, \u201cFor the CIA to commit such a brazen act\u2014and almost get caught in the middle of it\u2014and undermine Trump's leverage would have been tantamount to treason.\u201d\nAnalysts say Jayu Joseon is angling for support inside North Korea as well despite the obvious dangers of exposure and execution of anyone caught by Kim Jong Un\u2019s security apparatus. \u201cSenior defectors say these guys have to have contacts,\u201d said Kim Sung-bak, Hanyang University expert on North Korea. \u201cThey try to establish themselves as the legal government.\u201d\nChances of success are not good. \u201cIt's hard to imagine any opposition group outside North Korea having ties and support inside the DPRK,\u201d said a retired U.S. official who asked that his name not be used. \u201cThe risks are just too high and the internal security in the North is just too tight and pervasive.\u201d\nBe that as it may, the shadowy figures behind the participants in the raid promise a long struggle.\n\u201cPlease do not forget the kind of ruthless regime we are up against,\u201d says a message on the website. \u201cThey have no respect for international norms. The struggle we are engaged in with the incumbent regime is not a political race between equals, but a small revolutionary group, fighting and resisting a totalitarian regime that maintains concentration camps, keeps its people enslaved, and regularly kills its opponents and their families.\u201d\nThe inference was clear. They intend to be heard from again. The rescue of Kim Jong Nam\u2019s son and the raid in Madrid are not likely to be the end of the story. In Kuala Lumpur, the writing was on the wall.\nItxu D\u00edaz in Madrid also contributed reporting to this story.",

                "text": "Charles Harder, the celebrity attorney famous for the Hulk Hogan lawsuit that brought down Gawker, is now representing Donald Trump in the latest lawsuit filed by a sexual-misconduct accuser against the president, The Daily Beast has learned.\nOn Tuesday, Hassan Zavareei, an attorney repping the plaintiff Alva Johnson, said in a brief interview that Harder accepted service on behalf of Trump on March 11, and is serving as the president\u2019s outside counsel for this suit. Zavareei also provided The Daily Beast with a copy of Trump\u2019s \u201cwaiver of the service of summons\u201d\u2014necessary because it is nearly impossible to actually serve the president of the United States\u2014which is signed by \u201cCharles J. Harder.\u201d\nHarder\u2014who has represented the president in other matters including the lawsuit filed by porn actress Stormy Daniels\u2014did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. After publication of his scorched-earth remarks about the Trump family in Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire & Fury, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon received a letter from Harder threatening legal action.\nLast year, during the rollout of UNHINGED, a \u201ctell-all\u201d authored by former Apprentice villain and ex-senior Trump administration official Omarosa Manigault Newman, Harder shot the publisher Simon & Schuster a letter warning them of legal action \u201cshould you proceed with publishing and selling the Book.\u201d\nHarder has also done legal work for First Lady Melania Trump, as well as for Trump son-in-law and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner. Harder also repped the late Roger Ailes, an informal Trump adviser, during the former Fox News chief\u2019s sexual-harassment scandal.\nHogan\u2019s lawsuit against Gawker was underwritten by Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and a prominent ally of Donald Trump\u2019s.\nIn the new lawsuit, Johnson accuses Trump of grabbing her hand and kissing her without her consent in Tampa, Florida, on August 24, 2016, when she was a staffer on his presidential campaign. When The Washington Post broke the news of the federal lawsuit late last month, the White House, as well as other Trump associates said to be present at the 2016 event, vigorously denied the allegation, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling it \u201cabsurd on its face.\u201d\nIn an interview with The Daily Beast last month, Zavareei said that his client \u201cfeels partly responsible for helping put a sexual predator into the White House, and she believes she has an obligation to tell her story and to hold him accountable for what he\u2019s done to her but to so many other women.\u201d\nPresident Trump has faced numerous allegations from different women of sexual harassment or assault. The White House has maintained the various accusers are all simply lying.",

And <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-report-white-house-says-theyre-looking-forward-to-the-process-taking-its-course\">the full, un-redacted Mueller report</a>. And records of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-deutsche-bank-links-to-be-probed-by-house-investigators\">Trump&rsquo;s financial relations with Deutsche Bank</a> and other lenders. And much more.</p>\n<p>House Democrats need not ask meekly for information about Trump&rsquo;s finances and the Mueller report and accept whatever Trump voluntarily provides. The power of the House and of the Senate to compel the disclosure of documents and testimony to inform the exercise of their constitutional powers is very, very well-established. &ldquo;The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad,&rdquo; the Supreme Court said in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/360/109\"><em>Barenblatt v. United States</em></a>. &ldquo;It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate,&rdquo; the Supreme Court said in <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/354/178\"><em>Watkins v. United States</em></a>. &ldquo;The scope of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Citizens are required to comply with congressional subpoenas &ldquo;to testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation&rdquo; just as they are required to comply with judicial subpoenas.</p>\n<p>Trump and his political allies argue that Congress has no power to prosecute crimes, and matters under criminal investigation are none of House Democrats&rsquo; business. House Democrats have other obviously proper reasons to investigate Trump&rsquo;s financial interests and the Mueller Report, however.</p>\n<p>Congress&rsquo;s investigative powers are strongest when Congress seeks to expose corruption or mismanagement in the federal government, even if the conduct under investigation is the subject of other active legal proceedings. There is ample basis to suspect that Trump has used the powers of the presidency to enrich himself.</p>\n<p>Congress can also investigate corruption and other wrongdoing in the private sector in &ldquo;surveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them,&rdquo; the Supreme Court said in Watkins, and Congress frequently has. The Senate conducted extensive hearings in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s into organized crime and union corruption. Most Americans now just remember those hearings from the <em>Godfather</em> movies, but the hearings resulted in significant legislation. In 1970, Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to close loopholes that made criminal prosecution of crime bosses difficult and to allow private lawsuits by anyone harmed by criminal organizations. In 1974, Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) partly to protect pension plans from the sticky fingers of organized crime, which controlled many union pension plans at the time.</p>\n<p>House Democrats need not have particular legislation in mind to investigate Trump&rsquo;s finances or the Mueller Report. It is not at all difficult to imagine legislation that Congress might consider to remedy &ldquo;defects in our social, economic or political system&rdquo; that the investigations might reveal.</p>\n<p>Congress could enact legislation to require more financial disclosure by presidential candidates, rather than rely on the post-Watergate tradition that presidents and presidential candidates voluntarily making their tax returns public. Trump denied during the 2016 campaign that he had any financial interests in Russia, while his business was in advanced negotiations for an ambitious project in Moscow&mdash;a building that would reportedly have been the tallest in Europe. The project would have been enormously profitable to Trump. As a candidate, Trump softened the Republican Party platform&rsquo;s support for Ukraine in that nation&rsquo;s conflict with Russia, and spoke favorably of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a figure not widely admired in American politics.</p>\n<p>Many voters would like to have known in 2016 of Trump&rsquo;s negotiations with the Putin government for the proposed project in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Congress might enact more specific prohibitions or enforcement mechanisms for the Constitution&rsquo;s anti-corruption provisions, the emoluments clauses, to prevent any potential for self-dealing by the President and other government officials. Conflicts of interest rules are meant to protect even honest politicians from the subtle tug of self-interest, a tug that Trump shows no desire to resist. Trump&rsquo;s opulent hotel in downtown Washington has become the home away from home for officials from the world&rsquo;s most repugnant regimes, despite the ready availability of comparable accommodations nearby at a fraction of the cost. Trump has been very delicate in his criticism of many of those regimes, even in the face of barbaric conduct.</p>\n<p>Congress might close tax loopholes or increase appropriations for tax enforcement. It might revisit the independent counsel law to toughen the protection of criminal investigations from political interference.</p>\n<p>Congress might do all of that and more or nothing at all, but information about Trump&rsquo;s finances and the full Mueller Report would inform those decisions.</p>\n<p>Trump and his political allies promise to fight congressional investigations tooth and nail, and say that their legal challenges will block any disclosures until well after the 2020 election. Trump argues that any supposed legislative purpose is a &ldquo;pretext,&rdquo; and House Democrats just want to inflict political damage.</p>\n<p>The courts <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/140/383/2349124/\">recognize</a> a &ldquo;presumption of the validity of government proceedings,&rdquo; so that &ldquo;When a committee of Congress is engaged in a legitimate legislative inquiry and the questions propounded are relevant and material to the inquiry, the courts will not question the motives of the questioner.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In other words, if Congress has a valid legislative purpose for an investigation but also has political motives, then so what? When does Congress not have political motives?</p>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;pretext&rdquo; argument is legally flimsy, and maybe frivolous. It&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s got.</p>",

                "text": "President Trump may complain on Twitter or Fox News that congressional investigations are a \u201cpartisan witch hunt,\u201d \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d but few judges will want to hear it.\nOf course House Democrats have the legal power to obtain President Trump\u2019s tax returns. And the full, un-redacted Mueller report. And records of Trump\u2019s financial relations with Deutsche Bank and other lenders. And much more.\nHouse Democrats need not ask meekly for information about Trump\u2019s finances and the Mueller report and accept whatever Trump voluntarily provides. The power of the House and of the Senate to compel the disclosure of documents and testimony to inform the exercise of their constitutional powers is very, very well-established. \u201cThe power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad,\u201d the Supreme Court said in Barenblatt v. United States. \u201cIt encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.\u201d\n\u201cThe power of inquiry has been employed by Congress throughout our history, over the whole range of the national interests concerning which Congress might legislate or decide upon due investigation not to legislate; it has similarly been utilized in determining what to appropriate from the national purse, or whether to appropriate,\u201d the Supreme Court said in Watkins v. United States. \u201cThe scope of the power of inquiry, in short, is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution.\u201d\nCitizens are required to comply with congressional subpoenas \u201cto testify fully with respect to matters within the province of proper investigation\u201d just as they are required to comply with judicial subpoenas.\nTrump and his political allies argue that Congress has no power to prosecute crimes, and matters under criminal investigation are none of House Democrats\u2019 business. House Democrats have other obviously proper reasons to investigate Trump\u2019s financial interests and the Mueller Report, however.\nCongress\u2019s investigative powers are strongest when Congress seeks to expose corruption or mismanagement in the federal government, even if the conduct under investigation is the subject of other active legal proceedings. There is ample basis to suspect that Trump has used the powers of the presidency to enrich himself.\nCongress can also investigate corruption and other wrongdoing in the private sector in \u201csurveys of defects in our social, economic or political system for the purpose of enabling the Congress to remedy them,\u201d the Supreme Court said in Watkins, and Congress frequently has. The Senate conducted extensive hearings in the \u201950s and \u201960s into organized crime and union corruption. Most Americans now just remember those hearings from the Godfather movies, but the hearings resulted in significant legislation. In 1970, Congress enacted the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) to close loopholes that made criminal prosecution of crime bosses difficult and to allow private lawsuits by anyone harmed by criminal organizations. In 1974, Congress enacted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) partly to protect pension plans from the sticky fingers of organized crime, which controlled many union pension plans at the time.\nHouse Democrats need not have particular legislation in mind to investigate Trump\u2019s finances or the Mueller Report. It is not at all difficult to imagine legislation that Congress might consider to remedy \u201cdefects in our social, economic or political system\u201d that the investigations might reveal.\nCongress could enact legislation to require more financial disclosure by presidential candidates, rather than rely on the post-Watergate tradition that presidents and presidential candidates voluntarily making their tax returns public. Trump denied during the 2016 campaign that he had any financial interests in Russia, while his business was in advanced negotiations for an ambitious project in Moscow\u2014a building that would reportedly have been the tallest in Europe. The project would have been enormously profitable to Trump. As a candidate, Trump softened the Republican Party platform\u2019s support for Ukraine in that nation\u2019s conflict with Russia, and spoke favorably of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a figure not widely admired in American politics.\nMany voters would like to have known in 2016 of Trump\u2019s negotiations with the Putin government for the proposed project in Moscow.\nCongress might enact more specific prohibitions or enforcement mechanisms for the Constitution\u2019s anti-corruption provisions, the emoluments clauses, to prevent any potential for self-dealing by the President and other government officials. Conflicts of interest rules are meant to protect even honest politicians from the subtle tug of self-interest, a tug that Trump shows no desire to resist. Trump\u2019s opulent hotel in downtown Washington has become the home away from home for officials from the world\u2019s most repugnant regimes, despite the ready availability of comparable accommodations nearby at a fraction of the cost. Trump has been very delicate in his criticism of many of those regimes, even in the face of barbaric conduct.\nCongress might close tax loopholes or increase appropriations for tax enforcement. It might revisit the independent counsel law to toughen the protection of criminal investigations from political interference.\nCongress might do all of that and more or nothing at all, but information about Trump\u2019s finances and the full Mueller Report would inform those decisions.\nTrump and his political allies promise to fight congressional investigations tooth and nail, and say that their legal challenges will block any disclosures until well after the 2020 election. Trump argues that any supposed legislative purpose is a \u201cpretext,\u201d and House Democrats just want to inflict political damage.\nThe courts recognize a \u201cpresumption of the validity of government proceedings,\u201d so that \u201cWhen a committee of Congress is engaged in a legitimate legislative inquiry and the questions propounded are relevant and material to the inquiry, the courts will not question the motives of the questioner.\u201d\nIn other words, if Congress has a valid legislative purpose for an investigation but also has political motives, then so what? When does Congress not have political motives?\nTrump\u2019s \u201cpretext\u201d argument is legally flimsy, and maybe frivolous. It\u2019s all he\u2019s got.",

He goes on to say that Trump did not direct him to lie to Congress, but rather implied that he should.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there&rsquo;s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people,&rdquo; Cohen says in his statement. &ldquo;In his way, he was telling me to lie.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Cohen will provide the committee with a copy of a check Trump signed for the hush payments to two former Playboy models, copies of financial statements for 2011 to 2013 that Trump gave to institutions such as Deutsche Bank, and copies of letters Cohen wrote at Mr. Trump&rsquo;s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.</p>\n<p>Beyond establishing his regret for working for Trump, Cohen goes on to talk about exactly how Trump worked on the Trump Tower Moscow deal and says that he did indeed lie about the timeline, adding that Trump&rsquo;s personal lawyers reviewed and edited his statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow tower negotiations.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,&rdquo; Cohen says. &ldquo; He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Throughout his opening remarks, Cohen reiterates, over and over again, how Trump never truly believed he would win the primary let alone the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The campaign&mdash;for him&mdash;was always a marketing opportunity,&rdquo; Cohen says.</p>\n<p>But perhaps the most alarming allegation by Cohen has to do with the release of the Democratic National Committee emails. He says Trump in fact knew about the hacked records ahead of time.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails,&rdquo; Cohen says, adding that he was with Trump when he was on the phone with Stone who said he &ldquo;had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;[Stone said] Mr. Assange told [him] that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s campaign,&rdquo; Cohen says.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Cohen talks about a check President Trump signed to pay Stephanie Clifford as a hush payment about their interactions. Cohen demanded the payment to stay silent, Cohen says, adding that he regrets having lied to Trump&rsquo;s wife, Melania, about it.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly&mdash;and she did not deserve that.&rdquo;</p>",

                "text": "Michael Cohen released his opening remarks for the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Tuesday night, saying Donald Trump, essentially, had lied for years to the American people.\n\u201cThe sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better,\u201d Cohen says in his opening remarks. \u201cIn fact, he did the opposite.\u201d\nCohen reiterated his regret for lying to Congress about his work with President Trump.\n\u201cI regret the day I said \u201cyes\u201d to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way,\u201d Cohen says in his opening remarks for Wednesday\u2019s hearing.\nIn his statement, Cohen talks about his family and apologizes to his mother and father for letting them down.\n\u201cAs many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help,\u201d he says in his opening remarks. \u201cYet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\nCohen, Trump\u2019s former lawyer and self-described fixer, also says that he will submit documentation that shows how the president lied to the American people. He goes on to say that Trump did not direct him to lie to Congress, but rather implied that he should.\n\u201cIn conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there\u2019s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people,\u201d Cohen says in his statement. \u201cIn his way, he was telling me to lie.\u201d\nCohen will provide the committee with a copy of a check Trump signed for the hush payments to two former Playboy models, copies of financial statements for 2011 to 2013 that Trump gave to institutions such as Deutsche Bank, and copies of letters Cohen wrote at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores.\nBeyond establishing his regret for working for Trump, Cohen goes on to talk about exactly how Trump worked on the Trump Tower Moscow deal and says that he did indeed lie about the timeline, adding that Trump\u2019s personal lawyers reviewed and edited his statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow tower negotiations.\n\u201cTo be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it,\u201d Cohen says. \u201c He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.\u201d\nThroughout his opening remarks, Cohen reiterates, over and over again, how Trump never truly believed he would win the primary let alone the 2016 presidential election.\n\u201cThe campaign\u2014for him\u2014was always a marketing opportunity,\u201d Cohen says.\nBut perhaps the most alarming allegation by Cohen has to do with the release of the Democratic National Committee emails. He says Trump in fact knew about the hacked records ahead of time.\n\u201cMr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails,\u201d Cohen says, adding that he was with Trump when he was on the phone with Stone who said he \u201chad just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange.\u201d\n\u201c[Stone said] Mr. Assange told [him] that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d Cohen says.\nLastly, Cohen talks about a check President Trump signed to pay Stephanie Clifford as a hush payment about their interactions. Cohen demanded the payment to stay silent, Cohen says, adding that he regrets having lied to Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, about it.\n\u201cLying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets,\u201d he says. \u201cShe is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly\u2014and she did not deserve that.\u201d",

The measure, sponsored by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), is privileged, which means that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) must put it to a vote on the Senate floor within 18 days. With all 47 Senate Democrats expected to vote in favor, only four GOP senators would need to join them to ensure the resolution passes.</p>\n<p>Three already have: Sens. Susan Collins (ME), Lisa Murkowski (AK), and Thom Tillis (NC). Several others have sharply criticized Trump&rsquo;s move, but stopped short of saying how they would vote on the measure.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/republicans-give-trump-the-green-light-for-a-border-wall-emergency-declaration\"><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1350,w_2400,x_300,y_168/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_128/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1548786164/190129-Brodey-Trump-national-emergency-tease-_bomy19\"></img></figure></a></li></ul>\n<p>Even if the Senate approves the emergency-killing resolution, it&rsquo;s unlikely to be more than a speed bump for the president, who has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk. In that event, two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would need to get on board to overrule the veto, a threshold unlikely to be reached in either chamber.</p>\n<p>With Trump in Vietnam for a summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, his top lieutenants are on the Hill to quell any GOP revolt there. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence addressed Senate Republicans&rsquo; weekly lunch to persuade them to back the president up.</p>\n<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a strong supporter of the emergency declaration, told The Daily Beast that Pence said the emergency declaration applies to a specific statute with a &ldquo;limited application.&rdquo; He predicted Pence&rsquo;s talk may have moved some of his colleagues who are on the fence about how to vote. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/26/senate-republicans-trump-national-emergency-border-1189065\">Politico reported</a>, however, that Pence was met with skepticism, and that as many as 10 Republicans could defect.</p>\n<p>Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, the president retains broad authority to declare an emergency, which opens up special sources of funding for the executive branch. Trump is hoping to secure access to a pot of funds, estimated at $6 billion, that he could use to construct the border wall&mdash;though those funds would be diverted from other accounts, mainly for military construction and disaster relief.</p>\n<p>For the time being, the president is using the tussle with lawmakers as his immigration foil of the month, having pledged &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; last week to veto an effort by Congress to block his declaration of a national emergency.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nothing new on this front since [the president] commented,&rdquo; White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders emailed The Daily Beast on Tuesday afternoon.</p>\n<p>With or without the veto threat, however, some Trump allies and prominent immigration hardliners weren&rsquo;t keeping their hopes high to begin with. Dampened enthusiasm on the right stems from anxiety among conservative activists that Trump&rsquo;s emergency declaration could lay the groundwork for a Democratic administration to exploit.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried this is going to set the precedent, because we&rsquo;ve had multiple emergency declarations&hellip; since 1976, but none of them was issued after Congress refused to cooperate on some matter,&rdquo; said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m afraid of is that you are going to have President Maxine Waters declare a national handgun emergency&hellip; I&rsquo;m worried about the future of republican government, not so much that Trump is going to usurp the rules&hellip; but that using it in this way is going to create a harmful precedent, and that what he is going to do with that authority isn&rsquo;t going to accomplish much in reducing illegal immigration, anyway.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>What happens next in Congress will have political ramifications for both sides, but the most viable avenue to actually block Trump&rsquo;s declaration is through the courts. Sixteen states, all with Democratic governors, have filed a lawsuit against it that will be heard in a federal court in Oakland, California, this week.</p>",

                "text": "House Democrats on Tuesday easily passed a resolution to block President Donald Trump from using a national emergency declaration to pay for his border wall, setting the table for the real drama: whether the Republican-controlled Senate will rebuke the president by approving the resolution, too.\nThe House voted 245 to 182 in favor of the resolution, with 13 House Republicans joining all Democrats to approve it. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX), is privileged, which means that Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) must put it to a vote on the Senate floor within 18 days. With all 47 Senate Democrats expected to vote in favor, only four GOP senators would need to join them to ensure the resolution passes.\nThree already have: Sens. Susan Collins (ME), Lisa Murkowski (AK), and Thom Tillis (NC). Several others have sharply criticized Trump\u2019s move, but stopped short of saying how they would vote on the measure.\nEven if the Senate approves the emergency-killing resolution, it\u2019s unlikely to be more than a speed bump for the president, who has said he will veto the bill if it reaches his desk. In that event, two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would need to get on board to overrule the veto, a threshold unlikely to be reached in either chamber.\nWith Trump in Vietnam for a summit with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, his top lieutenants are on the Hill to quell any GOP revolt there. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence addressed Senate Republicans\u2019 weekly lunch to persuade them to back the president up.\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a strong supporter of the emergency declaration, told The Daily Beast that Pence said the emergency declaration applies to a specific statute with a \u201climited application.\u201d He predicted Pence\u2019s talk may have moved some of his colleagues who are on the fence about how to vote. Politico reported, however, that Pence was met with skepticism, and that as many as 10 Republicans could defect.\nUnder the National Emergencies Act of 1976, the president retains broad authority to declare an emergency, which opens up special sources of funding for the executive branch. Trump is hoping to secure access to a pot of funds, estimated at $6 billion, that he could use to construct the border wall\u2014though those funds would be diverted from other accounts, mainly for military construction and disaster relief.\nFor the time being, the president is using the tussle with lawmakers as his immigration foil of the month, having pledged \u201c100 percent\u201d last week to veto an effort by Congress to block his declaration of a national emergency.\n\u201cNothing new on this front since [the president] commented,\u201d White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders emailed The Daily Beast on Tuesday afternoon.\nWith or without the veto threat, however, some Trump allies and prominent immigration hardliners weren\u2019t keeping their hopes high to begin with. Dampened enthusiasm on the right stems from anxiety among conservative activists that Trump\u2019s emergency declaration could lay the groundwork for a Democratic administration to exploit.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried this is going to set the precedent, because we\u2019ve had multiple emergency declarations\u2026 since 1976, but none of them was issued after Congress refused to cooperate on some matter,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cWhat I\u2019m afraid of is that you are going to have President Maxine Waters declare a national handgun emergency\u2026 I\u2019m worried about the future of republican government, not so much that Trump is going to usurp the rules\u2026 but that using it in this way is going to create a harmful precedent, and that what he is going to do with that authority isn\u2019t going to accomplish much in reducing illegal immigration, anyway.\u201d\nWhat happens next in Congress will have political ramifications for both sides, but the most viable avenue to actually block Trump\u2019s declaration is through the courts. Sixteen states, all with Democratic governors, have filed a lawsuit against it that will be heard in a federal court in Oakland, California, this week.",

That petition calls for all 2020 candidates to take part in a debate or forum around environmental issues.</p>\n<p>Beyond scheduling the first two debates this summer, the DNC has not made commitments about the topics, hosts, or even structure of the rest of the dozen primary <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/unlikely-democrats-find-new-formula-for-making-the-2020-debate-stage-memes-pleas-and-charities\">debates</a>. In a statement to The Daily Beast, the committee said petitions for a single-issue debate on climate change would be considered, but it didn&rsquo;t go beyond that.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;While Republicans refuse to even acknowledge that climate change is real, Democrats are eager to put forward their solutions to combat climate change, and we will absolutely have these discussions during the 2020 primary process,&rdquo; Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC told The Daily Beast when asked about the petition. &ldquo;The DNC is currently ironing out the details for all 12 debates and will work with the networks to ensure that Democrats have a platform to discuss these issues directly with the American people.&quot;</p>\n<p>An aide to Inslee said that the campaign gave a heads up to the DNC before formally launching the petition. The aide also said that Inslee would be fine if the committee added a 13th debate to the schedule that was solely focused on climate change instead of making it one of the 12 currently planned.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to talk about when it comes to our climate and our environment,&rdquo; Inslee wrote. &ldquo;Climate justice. The health impact that big polluters are having on our communities. Access to clean water. Creating union jobs in a clean energy economy. Protecting federal lands. These topics deserve a focused debate.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/kirsten-gillibrand-formally-launches-her-2020-campaign-with-a-planned-rally-at-trumps-new-york-hotel\">Sen.

A DNC debate focused on climate change would show the world that America intends to lead again on this issue, and would be a smart place to discuss the key tenets of the Green New Deal&mdash;infrastructure, green jobs and clean air and water&mdash;and how to put a price on carbon,&rdquo; Gillibrand said. &ldquo;We need these ambitious goals to address climate change just like we needed President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s moonshot&mdash;not because it&rsquo;s easy, but because it&rsquo;s hard. I look forward to these discussions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE &mdash; April 17, 12:01 p.m.: This story has been updated with a new statement from Gillibrand. </em></p>",

                "text": "Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA), whose presidential campaign has been built on prioritizing climate change above all issues, is calling on the Democratic National Committee to host a presidential candidate debate solely on that one topic.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be a one-off question where candidates get to give a soundbite and move on: Climate change is at the heart of every issue that matters to voters, and voters deserve to hear what 2020 presidential candidates plan to do about it,\u201d Inslee wrote in an email to supporters, with an accompanying petition directed at the DNC. \u201cEach 2020 nominee needs to have a concrete plan to address climate change - and we deserve to hear those plans.\u201d\nThe call comes as a similar though separate petition, conceived by the U.S. Youth Climate Strike Team, has gained traction, nearing the goal of 30,000 signatures as of 8 P.M. on Tuesday. That petition calls for all 2020 candidates to take part in a debate or forum around environmental issues.\nBeyond scheduling the first two debates this summer, the DNC has not made commitments about the topics, hosts, or even structure of the rest of the dozen primary debates. In a statement to The Daily Beast, the committee said petitions for a single-issue debate on climate change would be considered, but it didn\u2019t go beyond that.\n\u201cWhile Republicans refuse to even acknowledge that climate change is real, Democrats are eager to put forward their solutions to combat climate change, and we will absolutely have these discussions during the 2020 primary process,\u201d Xochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC told The Daily Beast when asked about the petition. \u201cThe DNC is currently ironing out the details for all 12 debates and will work with the networks to ensure that Democrats have a platform to discuss these issues directly with the American people.\"\nAn aide to Inslee said that the campaign gave a heads up to the DNC before formally launching the petition. The aide also said that Inslee would be fine if the committee added a 13th debate to the schedule that was solely focused on climate change instead of making it one of the 12 currently planned.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much to talk about when it comes to our climate and our environment,\u201d Inslee wrote. \u201cClimate justice. The health impact that big polluters are having on our communities. Access to clean water. Creating union jobs in a clean energy economy. Protecting federal lands. These topics deserve a focused debate.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who was participating in a Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works field hearing on recent flooding in the region, told The Daily Beast in a statement that she also wants to see a climate-change debate.\n\u201cGlobal climate change is the greatest threat to humanity today, and we need ideas that are big enough and bold enough to address a threat so grave. A DNC debate focused on climate change would show the world that America intends to lead again on this issue, and would be a smart place to discuss the key tenets of the Green New Deal\u2014infrastructure, green jobs and clean air and water\u2014and how to put a price on carbon,\u201d Gillibrand said. \u201cWe need these ambitious goals to address climate change just like we needed President John F. Kennedy\u2019s moonshot\u2014not because it\u2019s easy, but because it\u2019s hard. I look forward to these discussions.\u201d\nUPDATE \u2014 April 17, 12:01 p.m.: This story has been updated with a new statement from Gillibrand.",

Contrary as their movements may seem, white supremacists and jihadists both leech off different ends of a tragedy like Christchurch as seen in the barrages of propaganda from both movements on social media.</p>\n<p>White supremacists <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Far-Right-/-Far-Left-Threat/white-supremacists-and-neo-nazis-react-to-new-zealand-mosque-attacks-no-sympathy-for-invaders.html\">celebrated the Christchurch attack</a> across various venues, from community-specific forums like Stormfront and Vanguard News Network (VNN) to alternative, free-speech-purposed social media platforms like Gab and Minds. Energized users have praised Brenton Tarrant&rsquo;s alleged attack in the context of other major far-right terrorist attacks, hailing him as a martyr to their cause.</p>\n<p>One such user posted clips of Tarrant&rsquo;s live video stream from his attack with the writing &ldquo;screw your optics,&rdquo; a reference to the final social media post by Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers, which has since become a meme among white nationalists.</p>\n<p>Another image disseminated by white nationalists <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Far-Right-/-Far-Left-Threat/neo-nazi-social-media-account-glorifies-christchurch-shooter-threatens-attacks-on-jews-and-african-americans.html\">depicted Tarrant as Jesus Christ</a>, accompanied by his writing-covered rifle and manifesto.</p>\n<p>Various users linked Tarrant to Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist whose 2011 attacks killed 77.</p>\n<p>Stormfront users were mixed in reactions&mdash;not so much in a <i>good-versus-bad</i> way, but in a <i>did-this-help-our-cause</i> way. User &ldquo;RedRosie,&rdquo; for example, said that &ldquo;<i>Mosques in our countries are a symbol of invasion. If even one of them closes permanently as a result of this, I call it a win.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised when the Christchurch attack remains a staple of jihadi propaganda a decade from now.</p>\n<p>But while white supremacists celebrate, Tarrant has done a major favor for ISIS and al Qaeda recruitment efforts.</p>\n<p>On platforms like Telegram messenger and Facebook, jihadists from around the world disseminated news of the shooting and called for revenge. For ISIS, the attack is an easily exploitable opportunity to radicalize prospective recruits and justify its incitements and attacks. In the immediate aftermath of the event, ISIS-linked channels online were flooded with messages characterizing ISIS as the only viable solution to such hate and demanding attacks on &ldquo;Crusaders,&rdquo; a label which ISIS and its supporters attribute loosely to any Christian or member of a Christian-majority country.</p>\n<p>The administrator of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Chatter/jihadists-both-aq-and-is-aligned-enraged-by-attack-at-new-zealand-mosques-demand-and-incite-for-revenge.html\">Supporters of the Truth</a>,&rdquo; an ISIS-linked English-language Telegram channel, wrote that the Christchurch attack is an &ldquo;example why the Crusaders deserve no mercy at all, and why they should be massacred whenever an opportunity arises.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Rapidly created posters by ISIS-linked media groups similarly urged for lone wolf attacks on churches as revenge for the Christchurch attack. <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Chatter/jihadists-incite-for-attacks-on-churches-as-reciprocity-for-new-zealand-shootings.html\">One poster</a> depicts an ISIS fighter in a church, inciting, &ldquo;You alone wolf of the Muslims who are lying everywhere, make yourself a torch that burns their skins&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Other messages suggested broader ranges of targets. An Indonesian-language post disseminated across ISIS-linked channels and chat groups called for Muslims to give a &ldquo;worthy reply&rdquo; to &ldquo;travelers from the land of Australia.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Responding to Tarrant&rsquo;s livestreamed video of the attack, which showed his rifles covered in white supremacists slogans, ISIS supporters online disseminated an image of a rifle with Arabic text threatening revenge.</p>\n<p>Like the aftermath of other tragedies, social media has played a critical role in capitalizing on the Christchurch attack. On an ISIS-linked Telegram chat group, user &ldquo;<a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Chatter/jihadists-both-aq-and-is-aligned-enraged-by-attack-at-new-zealand-mosques-demand-and-incite-for-revenge.html'\">al-Aseef al-Baghdadi</a>&rdquo; demanded that fellow ISIS supporters &ldquo;logon to Facebook and Twitter and incite for shedding the blood of the worshippers of the Cross.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>On March 18, three days after the Christchuch attack, ISIS released a <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Statements/is-spokesman-disputes-u-s-declaration-of-victory-condemns-new-zealand-shootings.html\">speech</a> by its spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, in which he comments on the attacks, among other topics. Despite ISIS&rsquo; years of labeling non-supporting Muslims as apostates, Muhajir&rsquo;s speech seemed to temporarily disregard that history upon the victims&rsquo; sudden propagandic value:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The scenes of death in the two mosques are enough to wake the sleep and incite the supporters of the Caliphate who live there&hellip; to take vengeance for their religion&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And it&rsquo;s not just ISIS leeching off the tragedy. A statement from Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement spokesman <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Statements/shabaab-spokesman-condemns-trump-in-press-conference-on-new-zealand-shootings-vows-revenge.html\">Ali Mahmoud Rage</a>, a <a href=\"https://ent.siteintelgroup.com/Statements/aqim-jnim-release-joint-statement-on-new-zealand-shootings-call-to-target-crusader-far-right.html\">joint statement</a> from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Jama&rsquo;at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), and other messages by al Qaeda entities condemned Donald Trump as leading the &ldquo;mountain of Western hatred&rdquo; against Islam. However, their messages also argue a point unsurprisingly similar to that of white nationalists: that the Christchurch attack was the result of an inevitable hostility between Muslims and Christians in the West.</p>\n<p>The al Qaeda affiliates also called for revenge, with the joint AQIM-JNIM statement demanding for lone wolves to target &ldquo;the heads of the Crusader far right.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This growing mountain of responses considered, don&rsquo;t be surprised when the Christchurch attack remains a staple of jihadi propaganda a decade from now.</p>\n<p>These parallel swells of incitements by both jihadists and far-right extremists in some ways strip both movements of their ideological veils, leaving behind a much barer look at extremism itself. For these violent groups and communities, such tragedies are mutually beneficial events. That said, an attack like that in Christchurch should not be seen simply a tragedy in and of itself; it is a link in a longer, branching chain of attacks.

                "text": "s the world digests the heartbreaking details of last week\u2019s white nationalist terrorist attack against two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, we must once more reckon with the same horrid violence we\u2019ve seen from Dylann Roof, Robert Bowers, and others in recent years\u2014the latest reminder in the post 9/11 West that terrorism is not limited to radical jihadists.\nStill, even the most direct of comparisons between movements like the so-called Islamic State and neo-Nazis frequently fall short to describe the extent to which these movements mirror each other. Contrary as their movements may seem, white supremacists and jihadists both leech off different ends of a tragedy like Christchurch as seen in the barrages of propaganda from both movements on social media.\nWhite supremacists celebrated the Christchurch attack across various venues, from community-specific forums like Stormfront and Vanguard News Network (VNN) to alternative, free-speech-purposed social media platforms like Gab and Minds. Energized users have praised Brenton Tarrant\u2019s alleged attack in the context of other major far-right terrorist attacks, hailing him as a martyr to their cause.\nOne such user posted clips of Tarrant\u2019s live video stream from his attack with the writing \u201cscrew your optics,\u201d a reference to the final social media post by Pittsburgh synagogue shooter Robert Bowers, which has since become a meme among white nationalists.\nAnother image disseminated by white nationalists depicted Tarrant as Jesus Christ, accompanied by his writing-covered rifle and manifesto.\nVarious users linked Tarrant to Anders Breivik, the far-right Norwegian terrorist whose 2011 attacks killed 77.\nStormfront users were mixed in reactions\u2014not so much in a good-versus-bad way, but in a did-this-help-our-cause way. User \u201cRedRosie,\u201d for example, said that \u201cMosques in our countries are a symbol of invasion. If even one of them closes permanently as a result of this, I call it a win.\u201d\nDon\u2019t be surprised when the Christchurch attack remains a staple of jihadi propaganda a decade from now.\nBut while white supremacists celebrate, Tarrant has done a major favor for ISIS and al Qaeda recruitment efforts.\nOn platforms like Telegram messenger and Facebook, jihadists from around the world disseminated news of the shooting and called for revenge. For ISIS, the attack is an easily exploitable opportunity to radicalize prospective recruits and justify its incitements and attacks. In the immediate aftermath of the event, ISIS-linked channels online were flooded with messages characterizing ISIS as the only viable solution to such hate and demanding attacks on \u201cCrusaders,\u201d a label which ISIS and its supporters attribute loosely to any Christian or member of a Christian-majority country.\nThe administrator of \u201cSupporters of the Truth,\u201d an ISIS-linked English-language Telegram channel, wrote that the Christchurch attack is an \u201cexample why the Crusaders deserve no mercy at all, and why they should be massacred whenever an opportunity arises.\u201d\nRapidly created posters by ISIS-linked media groups similarly urged for lone wolf attacks on churches as revenge for the Christchurch attack. One poster depicts an ISIS fighter in a church, inciting, \u201cYou alone wolf of the Muslims who are lying everywhere, make yourself a torch that burns their skins\u2026\u201d\nOther messages suggested broader ranges of targets. An Indonesian-language post disseminated across ISIS-linked channels and chat groups called for Muslims to give a \u201cworthy reply\u201d to \u201ctravelers from the land of Australia.\u201d\nResponding to Tarrant\u2019s livestreamed video of the attack, which showed his rifles covered in white supremacists slogans, ISIS supporters online disseminated an image of a rifle with Arabic text threatening revenge.\nLike the aftermath of other tragedies, social media has played a critical role in capitalizing on the Christchurch attack. On an ISIS-linked Telegram chat group, user \u201cal-Aseef al-Baghdadi\u201d demanded that fellow ISIS supporters \u201clogon to Facebook and Twitter and incite for shedding the blood of the worshippers of the Cross.\u201d\nOn March 18, three days after the Christchuch attack, ISIS released a speech by its spokesman Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, in which he comments on the attacks, among other topics. Despite ISIS\u2019 years of labeling non-supporting Muslims as apostates, Muhajir\u2019s speech seemed to temporarily disregard that history upon the victims\u2019 sudden propagandic value:\n\u201cThe scenes of death in the two mosques are enough to wake the sleep and incite the supporters of the Caliphate who live there\u2026 to take vengeance for their religion\u2026\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not just ISIS leeching off the tragedy. A statement from Shabaab al-Mujahideen Movement spokesman Ali Mahmoud Rage, a joint statement from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM), and other messages by al Qaeda entities condemned Donald Trump as leading the \u201cmountain of Western hatred\u201d against Islam. However, their messages also argue a point unsurprisingly similar to that of white nationalists: that the Christchurch attack was the result of an inevitable hostility between Muslims and Christians in the West.\nThe al Qaeda affiliates also called for revenge, with the joint AQIM-JNIM statement demanding for lone wolves to target \u201cthe heads of the Crusader far right.\u201d\nThis growing mountain of responses considered, don\u2019t be surprised when the Christchurch attack remains a staple of jihadi propaganda a decade from now.\nThese parallel swells of incitements by both jihadists and far-right extremists in some ways strip both movements of their ideological veils, leaving behind a much barer look at extremism itself. For these violent groups and communities, such tragedies are mutually beneficial events. That said, an attack like that in Christchurch should not be seen simply a tragedy in and of itself; it is a link in a longer, branching chain of attacks. From jihadists\u2019 attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France and Pulse nightclub in Orlando, to white nationalists\u2019 attacks on the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City and now in Christchurch\u2014each of these events adds more fuel to extremists\u2019 delusions of \u201cCrusades\u201d and ethnic \u201cinvasions.\u201d They feed into their poisonous narratives that praying to one\u2019s God, whichever one it may be, is an act of war.\nGovernments and the tech sector took years to address ISIS\u2019 recruitment boom on social media. They\u2019re repeating that mistake now with white supremacists.\nIt\u2019s not incorrect to attribute Tarrant\u2019s alleged attack on a toxic and divisive political climate, but it does miss just how important the Internet itself is in allowing violent extremist ideology to thrive. Far-right movements and ISIS began surging around the same time in recent years, both driven by the unfettered power of social media. The planning and recruitment that once required secret meetings and burned letters now takes place uninterrupted, right out in the open.\nWorsening the problem is a prevalent delusion that warning signs from people like Tarrant are somehow more elusive than those of the jihadists who are so frequently monitored and thwarted. The Internet, and especially social media, is among the most critical elements giving life to these communities. And when comparing the way jihadist online spaces are handled compared to white supremacists, it\u2019s not even close; hiding behind images of their countries\u2019 flags and pseudo-patriotic slogans, white supremacists are too often left unchecked. Tarrant streamed his alleged attack online not just to shock us, but because he knew he would have an audience of supporters, who are still producing glorifying propaganda from his barbaric broadcast.\nIt took governments and the tech sector years to address ISIS\u2019 recruitment boom on social media. Today, we\u2019re seeing the same blunder when it comes to white supremacist communities. Thus, as we mourn for the victims of Christchurch and their families, diminishing extremists\u2019 capacity online should be just as much a preventative focus as any other social or legislative measures to come.",

Chris Collins&rsquo; (R-N.Y.) reelection campaign in the first three months of 2019.</p>\n<p>Collins, who is facing federal securities fraud charges, brought in just $5,000 in the first quarter of the year, according to a <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00520379/1324636/sa/ALL\">filing with the Federal Election Commission</a> this week. That&rsquo;s compared to the roughly <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00520379/1157969/\">$280,000</a> he raised in the same period during the 2018 election cycle. And this time around, none of the money came from individual contributors.</p>\n<p>The funds Collins received came from two political action committees representing moderate, business-friendly Republicans&mdash;the Tuesday Group PAC and the Republican Main Street Partnership (RMSP)&mdash;and from the campaign committee of a former colleague, Dan Donovan, a Staten Island Republican who lost his House reelection bid last year.</p>\n<p>Collins office did not immediately return request for comment.</p>\n<p>Collins was <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/chris-collins-new-york-congressman-charged-with-insider-trading\">arrested in August</a> and charged with 10 criminal counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, wire fraud, making false statements to the FBI. Federal prosecutors say Collins used his position on the board of a pharmaceutical company to glean information about its upcoming failure in a key drug trial, and shared that information with his son, who subsequently sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock in the company.</p>\n<p>Despite that, the congressman, who pleaded not guilty last year, went on to narrowly win reelection in 2018. He has is now <a href=\"http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/H8NY29032/1292391/\">vying for another term in office</a>, even with a court hearing in his case <a href=\"https://buffalonews.com/2019/01/08/judge-sets-next-court-hearing-in-collins-case-for-september/\">scheduled</a> for this September.</p>\n<p>He&rsquo;s running with virtually no financial support. The Tuesday Group and RMSP each donated $1,000 to Collins in February, and each gave another $1,000 in March. Collins was one of dozens of members of Congress to which the two groups donated in the first three months of the year. Donovan&rsquo;s campaign committee also donated $1,000 to Collins in February along with a number of his House Republican colleagues.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://republicanmainstreet.org/members/\">RMSP website</a> continues to display Collins&rsquo; photo among its list of endorsed candidates. Asked about that support in light of Collins&rsquo; legal troubles, a spokesperson told The Daily Beast, &ldquo;Rep. Chris Collins was re-elected to a fourth term by the constituents of New York's 27th district. Republican Main Street Partnership respects the will of the people.&quot;</p>\n<p>Collins used the money from RMSP and his other first quarter donors, as well as a decent stockpile of cash left over from his 2018 reelection bid, to pay lawyers and campaign consultants. He also reported three expenditures in January and February for &ldquo;fundraising events,&rdquo; despite the complete lack of individual donors to his campaign through the end of last month. He ended the first quarter of 2019 with $167,000 cash on hand.</p>\n<p>The western New York congressional district that Collins represents, which includes some of the Buffalo suburbs, is the most heavily Republican district in the state. But controversy over Collins&rsquo; indictment last year made his 2018 reelection race a close one. He narrowly eked out a win, besting Democrat Nate McMurray by fewer than 1,100 votes out of more than 285,000 cast.</p>\n<p>Collins is now a top name on Democrats&rsquo; 2020 target list, and McMurray has signaled that he may challenge him once again.</p>",

I&rsquo;m tired, Ivanka.</p>\n<p>Ivanka Trump hasn&rsquo;t earned a thing in her life except a permanent ban from the <em>Vanity Fair </em>Oscar Party, and maybe by the end of her father&rsquo;s term, lifetime VIP status at Cracker Barrel.</p>\n<p>If I had to venture a guess, I&rsquo;d say Ivanka&rsquo;s targeting of AOC and the Green New Deal is part of a broader Republican strategy to seize upon the &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; part of the New York representative&rsquo;s democratic socialist ties. Socialist policies&mdash;universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage, universal childcare, subsidized green infrastructure projects&mdash;work just fine in plenty of other places and are more popular stateside now than they&rsquo;ve been in decades, but if we try anything that even hints at wealth redistribution, the reasoning goes, we&rsquo;re proposing that old ladies stand in a line to wait for bread and children eat rats. We so much as agree that we are collectively responsible for each other&rsquo;s well-being and we&rsquo;re basically Venezuela. It&rsquo;s kindergarten-level political apples-and-oranges, but right now, it&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;ve got.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s puzzling to me is why Ivanka would think &ldquo;people prefer to earn their own money&rdquo; is her way to make a smooth landing on this bullshit-slick of a talking point. Ivanka is the poster child for why wealth should be redistributed in this country. The legacy rich did not earn the means that enable them to oppress and take from those who actually work. Ivanka, like her father and siblings, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-world-kids-are-putting-their-parents-at-risk\">was born on third base and thinks she invented baseball</a>.</p>\n<p>Ivanka Trump, heiress to millions of dollars whose own father was handed millions of dollars, who rose through Washington, D.C. buoyed by the unearned power of nepotism, believes other people, in their hearts, want to earn their own money. Ivanka Trump, whose own book is filled with page-filling quotes attributed to other people, thinks the rest of us ought to be makers, not takers. Ivanka Trump, beneficiary of sweatshop labor, believes hard work should be rewarded. Ivanka Trump, a high-level White House advisor who whines and ducks behind her status as a child of her boss when journalists ask her tough questions. Ivanka Fucking Trump, who graduated from Penn despite being incapable of correctly using the word &ldquo;otherwise,&rdquo; with some wise words on the value of labor and merit.</p>\n<p>If I am to take Ivanka Trump&rsquo;s latest ejaculation of blithe stupidity seriously&mdash;and for the purposes of this column, sure, why not?&mdash;then I can only conclude that she is troubled by her unearned status, and that she plans to donate her entire inheritance to Americans whose labor was stolen from them. Perhaps a reparations fund for descendants of the slaves who built this country. Maybe something more modern, like restitution for women who were paid less than their male counterparts for performing the same jobs. (Ivanka loves women, right? That&rsquo;s her whole thing!)</p>\n<p>How about the legal bills for undocumented people formerly employed by her family&rsquo;s country club, who now find themselves at the mercy of the immigration system? Since she prefers earning her own money, deep in her heart, she could also consider donating her unearned fortune back to her father, who could use his also-unearned fortune to pay the many contractors he stiffed on construction projects.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty more people whose uncompensated labor has benefited Ivanka Trump who would really enjoy being paid.</p>\n<p>Tapping a person whose entire life was built on work she didn&rsquo;t do to serve as the spokeswoman for the heart of the American worker is rabidly idiotic. But whatever backlash the White House experiences from this, at least they&rsquo;ve earned it.</p>",

Ivanka Fucking Trump, who graduated from Penn despite being incapable of correctly using the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d with some wise words on the value of labor and merit.\nIf I am to take Ivanka Trump\u2019s latest ejaculation of blithe stupidity seriously\u2014and for the purposes of this column, sure, why not?\u2014then I can only conclude that she is troubled by her unearned status, and that she plans to donate her entire inheritance to Americans whose labor was stolen from them. Perhaps a reparations fund for descendants of the slaves who built this country. Maybe something more modern, like restitution for women who were paid less than their male counterparts for performing the same jobs. (Ivanka loves women, right? That\u2019s her whole thing!)\nHow about the legal bills for undocumented people formerly employed by her family\u2019s country club, who now find themselves at the mercy of the immigration system? Since she prefers earning her own money, deep in her heart, she could also consider donating her unearned fortune back to her father, who could use his also-unearned fortune to pay the many contractors he stiffed on construction projects.\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty more people whose uncompensated labor has benefited Ivanka Trump who would really enjoy being paid.\nTapping a person whose entire life was built on work she didn\u2019t do to serve as the spokeswoman for the heart of the American worker is rabidly idiotic. But whatever backlash the White House experiences from this, at least they\u2019ve earned it.",
